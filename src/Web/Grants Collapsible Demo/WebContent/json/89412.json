It examines and compares selected life narratives of Indigenous and non-Indigenous writers in order to explore how these texts differently configure identity as well as how these understandings have been interpreted by Indigenous and non-Indigenous critics and readers.  The project will map the changes within public debates including the significant social, political and cultural consequences for all involved.  A number of conference papers and published articles will contribute to the debates from an Indigenous perspective, extending critical perspectives within Australian cultural domains.","scientific_title":"Issues of Identity, Place and Belonging in Recent Works of Australian Autobiography","start_year":2004,"arc_grant_id":"DI0454216","total_budget":"$33,512","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Adelaide","state":"SA","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-460832","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89063","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms SJ Kurtzer...","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0454216:Ms SJ Kurtzer; Prof Dr KL Schaffer; A/Prof ME Allen","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Ms SJ Kurtzer; Prof Dr KL Schaffer; A/Prof ME Allen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89413","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89412","size":1}
