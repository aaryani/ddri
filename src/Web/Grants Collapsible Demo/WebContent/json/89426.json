Therefore, it is important to develop new techniques to sustain crop production in today's climate. Developing a clearer understanding of brassinosteroids, their underlying role in water stresses and their interaction with known stress-related hormones, such as abscisic acid and ethylene, will eventually enable more effective and efficient manipulation of plant growth in water stressed areas. This project has the added advantage of working with a legume, a group of plants that make a substantial contribution to the Australian economy. Our increased knowledge of legume development will help underpin future growth of this sector.","scientific_title":"Brassinosteroids and Water Stresses","start_year":2006,"arc_grant_id":"DI0667638","total_budget":"$166,080","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"University of Tasmania","state":"Tas","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-460913","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89378","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms CE Jager; ...","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0667638:Ms CE Jager; Prof JB Reid","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Ms CE Jager; Prof JB Reid"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89427","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89426","size":1}
