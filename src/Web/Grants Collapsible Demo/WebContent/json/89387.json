These routes are documented in instruments of land management such as churingas, toas or shields, and in the mnemotic memory of songs and stories. By reading together these two types of knowledge - of European exploration and of Aboriginal authorship of country - popular ways of 'knowing Aborigines' become fundamentally reinscribed and much popular knowledge about Aboriginal societies is deeply challenged.","scientific_title":"Dreaming Tracks and Trading Paths - a study of Aboriginal trading routes through Queensland","start_year":2003,"arc_grant_id":"DI0347624","total_budget":"$20,022","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Griffith Univ...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"Griffith University","state":"Qld","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-465942","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89385","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr RJ Ganter","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0347624:Dr RJ Ganter","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Dr RJ Ganter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89389","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr D Kerwin","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0347624:Mr D Kerwin","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Mr D Kerwin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89388","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89387","size":1}
