Its aim is to demonstrate how race operates as an external and prescriptive marker, which is internalised and performed; and how race intersects with other factors operating on the construction of identity. This notion challenges many standard accounts, and provides a new and innovative framework for analysing race and identity. The project draws on work and theories rarely used in analysing racial identity in Australia, and applies them in new and innovative ways. The expected outcomes include resolution of problems of difference in race and identity, within race theory.","scientific_title":"The Intersubjectivity of Race in the Social and Personal Construction of Identity and Self Identification","start_year":2003,"arc_grant_id":"DI0348095","total_budget":"$20,000","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of New South Wales","state":"NSW","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89069","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr R Diprose","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0348095:Dr R Diprose","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Dr R Diprose"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89403","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms D Davis","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0348095:Ms D Davis","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Ms D Davis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89402","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89401","size":1}
