The cause of IEE is unknown in many patients, although presumed genetic. This study of patients with IEE in Victoria aims to describe the incidence of IEE, and understand the genetic causes of IEE. Understanding the causes of IEE will be the first step towards development of urgently-needed novel therapies for these devastating conditions."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74847","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76252","size":1}
