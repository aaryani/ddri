They cause slowly progressive weakness and increasing disability.  For more than half, a specific diagnosis cannot be achieved with current diagnostic techniques, frequently generating significant anxiety for families.  This research will use an exciting new genetic technique called exome sequencing to provide fundamental insights into the genetic basis of these diseases, thus improving diagnosis, counselling and treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Sydney","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-593941","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/13","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74869","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76269","size":1}
