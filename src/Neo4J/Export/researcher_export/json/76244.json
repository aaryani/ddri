It potentially could lead to destruction of joint, severely limiting quality of life and ultimately requiring joint replacement surgery. Currently there is no effective medical treatment to manage this. Based on our animal experiments we want to study if Zoledronic acid could prevent severe joint destruction in these children and improve their quality of life."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Sydney","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-593941","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/13","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76067","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76244","size":1}
