Currently obstetricians rely on ultrasound measures of the baby's wellbeing which do not always correspond with how sick the baby truly is.   There is a great need for a more accurate test.  This research intends to show that a blood test from the mother can more accurately tell how sick the baby is and provide an answer to when is the best time to deliver the baby."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74821","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76233","size":1}
