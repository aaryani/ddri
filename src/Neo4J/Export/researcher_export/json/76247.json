Without it, every time you walk, run, or drive on a bumpy road, the world appears to bounce. We have developed a device shown to reliably 'train up' the balance system. Our aim is to develop this device further for effective take-home rehabilitation."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of New South Wales","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-593921","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/7","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74798","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76247","size":1}
