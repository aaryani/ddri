About 4% of young adults have it, yet most are unaware they have it. Chlamydia is easy to diagnose and treat, but it is not known whether annual testing can reduce its spread. Over1 million tests are conducted each year in general practice, costing the government $30 million. This evaluation of a well-established trial of chlamydia testing in young adults will resolve the debate of whether annual testing works and is a good use of money."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74916","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76271","size":1}
