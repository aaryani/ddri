This disease often presents in advanced stages with poor response to established medical and surgical therapies. Our aim is to develop a novel mouse model of oesophageal cancer, allowing us to tailor cancer-inhibiting molecular treatments to individual patients by predicting therapeutic success or resistance with the use of cellular markers identified in our animal mode."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74865","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76260","size":1}
