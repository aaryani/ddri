Because we still know very little about how genetic variation is distributed among the multiple traits that are likely to respond to selection in such circumstances, we have no way of directly measuring the evolutionary potential of any natural population.  In this proposal, we develop the theory, statistical tools, and experimental designs to investigate the nature and prevalence of these multivariate genetic constraints.","scientific_title":"The Geometry of Genetic Limits to Evolutionary Change","start_year":2010,"arc_grant_id":"DP1093474","total_budget":"$630,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Queensland","state":"Qld","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89183","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/111523","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Sexual select...","data":{"research_area":"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","research_area_code":"2707","application_year":2007,"purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP0880159","description":"Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation.

Microarray technology is at the forefront of modern genomics, but despite its promise, is currently restricted in its utility by significant analytical problems associated with the analysis of the large number of gene expression profiles and their interpretation.   Analytical approaches will be developed that will substantially enhance the ability of transcriptional profiling to effectively uncover key genes underlying important phenotypes of interest across the biological and medical sciences.","scientific_title":"The Genomic Dimensionality of the Response to Natural Selection","start_year":2007,"arc_grant_id":"DP0769995","total_budget":"$240,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Queensland","state":"Qld","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89183","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/101584","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mapping Speci...","data":{"research_area":"GENETICS","research_area_code":"2702","application_year":2001,"purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP0209259","description":"Although Darwin's seminal work was entitled \"On the Origin of Species\", how new species arise is still poorly understood. Modern genetic techniques and quantitative trait loci analysis (QTLs) potentially allow the characterization of the genetic basis of traits directly involved in the speciation process. I intend to conduct two complementary QTL analyses of reproductive isolation in the Drosophila serrata complex.  The first will determine the genetic basis of reproductive isolation between D. serrata and D. birchii, while the second will determine if the same loci are currently under natural selection in D. serrata populations that are sympatric with D. birchii.
