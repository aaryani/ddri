Invasion into nearby nerves or �perineural invasion� occurs in approximately 5% of cases. This signifies that the tumour is aggressive and able to spread along nerves back to the brain and reduce survival. Why some tumours invade nerves remains unclear. This project will study the factors involved and the characteristics of affected patients to enable a better understanding of the disease and potentially improve treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Queensland In...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Queensland Institute of Medical Research","state":"QLD","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-623462","type":"Research","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/252","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74905","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76272","size":1}
