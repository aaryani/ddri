Nonetheless, Australia's coral reef communities are threatened by various human activities and climate change. Wisely designed systems of marine reserves are critical to mitigating threats to coral reefs, but existing approaches do not incorporate crucial information about ecological connections between reefs. We will use graph theory metrics to identify priority reefs for protection based on empirical genetic and hydrological connectivity information. In addition, we will determine the sensitivity of these priorities to climate change scenarios.","scientific_title":"Coral reef connectivity: an empirical and theoretical synthesis","start_year":2008,"arc_grant_id":"DP0878306","total_budget":"$473,640","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Queensland","state":"Qld","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89183","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/108415","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Equipment Grant"],"nhmrc_grant_id":361659,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Ms Julia Malone","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/361659","simplified_title":"Equipment","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"206933","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Murdoch Child...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Murdoch Childrens Research Institute","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-1306438","type":"Research","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/152","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6746","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141473","size":1}
