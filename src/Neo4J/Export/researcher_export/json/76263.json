Pertussis (whooping cough), rotavirus, and varicella (chicken-pox) vaccines will be assessed using routinely collected health data, such as disease notifications and hospitalisations, and vaccination data. The findings of this research will contribute to evaluating the effectiveness of these publicly funded vaccination programs and will provide an evidence base for future decision-making."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Queensland","state":"QLD","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-460867","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/22","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74864","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76263","size":1}
