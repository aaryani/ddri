Up to 80% of cancer patients suffer and 25% succumb to this condition. This significantly affects the treatment regimens of cancer patients and affects their quality of life. We have developed monoclonal antibodies that block and reverse cachexia in preclinical mouse cancer models. Our aims are to humanise the antibody and manufacture it for the first clinical trial in humans."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"La Trobe Univ...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"La Trobe University","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-496332","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/10","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76084","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76248","size":1}
