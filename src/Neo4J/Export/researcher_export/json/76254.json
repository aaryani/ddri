Initially thought to facilitate cancer spread, recent studies suggest it may actually be protective. In a new approach, we will analyse new DNA databases and patient data from around the world. We hope to extend our understanding of PTHrP, and perhaps find novel drug and therapeutic targets."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74878","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76254","size":1}
