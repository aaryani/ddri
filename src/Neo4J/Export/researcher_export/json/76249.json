For children with asthma or cystic fibrosis, who may not stop breathing during the night, how hard their breathing muscles work can have a significant impact on their health. A non-invasive method of measuring respiratory effort, and incorporating this measurement into how sleep-disordered breathing is diagnosed, can revolutionize how sleep-disordered breathing in children are managed world-wide."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of New South Wales","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-593921","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/7","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74855","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76249","size":1}
