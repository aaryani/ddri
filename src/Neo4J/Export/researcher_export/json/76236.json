Prof Hopper (supervisor) has led international research in this area using a method called CUMULUS. Drs Makalic and Schmidt (co-supervisors) have created an automated measure, called CIRRUS. My aims are to: find out which factors influence CIRRUS, confirm that CIRRUS predicts breast cancer risk, and develop automated measures of a breast cancer risk based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74824","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76236","size":1}
