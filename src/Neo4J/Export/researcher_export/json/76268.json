My thesis will explore the role of Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR9 in the initiation and pathogenesis of AAV and the therapeutic potential of TLR2/9 inhibitors. I will use both a murine experimental model and human kidney biopsy samples in this work. My thesis will further define the critical molecular events that underlie the disease whilst addressing potential new therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Monash Univer...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Monash University","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-507067","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/28","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74877","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76268","size":1}
