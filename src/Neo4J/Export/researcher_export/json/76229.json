Their cause is not clearly established.   Pituitary adenomas are one of the most frequent intracranial tumours.  The genetics of sporadic tumours is unknown.  Craniopharyngiomas are rare brain tumours arising in the pituitary stalk area that can have profound effects, presenting in childhood or later.  To date there is limited knowledge on the cell signaling pathways causing these tumors, which can help to understand cancer in general."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Sydney","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-593941","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/13","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74834","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76229","size":1}
