This project combines a well-established scaffold that can be custom-made to address patient specific requirements with a novel source of graft that can be harvested in significant volumes with minimal pain and morbidity. This novel tissue engineering approach will be evaluated in a previously established pre-clinical model that reflects the severity of challenging clinical scenarios."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Queensland Un...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Queensland University of Technology","state":"QLD","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-536697","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/613","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74800","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76258","size":1}
