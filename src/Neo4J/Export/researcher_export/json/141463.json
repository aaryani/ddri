Whole genome expression and protein profiling will be used to characterise genes whose expression is altered in the infected host and to analyse genes involved in the control of key cellular processes. The Centre will also determine the shapes of key molecules and their interactions. Practical outcomes will include new veterinary vaccines and the identification of novel antimicrobial targets.","scientific_title":"ARC Centre of Excellence in Structural and Functional Microbial Genomics","start_year":2003,"arc_grant_id":"CE0348193","total_budget":"$4,897,495","arc_scheme":"CE","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Monash Univer...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"Monash University","state":"Vic","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-507067","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89110","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89151","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The claustrum...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2016,"keywords":["cerebral cortex","sensory systems","electrophysiology","anatomy","connections"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1068140,"application_year":2013,"start_year":2014,"scientific_title":"The claustrum enigma: unlocking the role of the last unknown area of the primate brain","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr David Reser","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1068140","simplified_title":"Understanding the role of the claustrum in brain function","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"548675.58","source_system":"Despite nearly 200 years of study, the function of the claustrum remains unclear. Interest in this brain structure has recently been revived by findings showing damage to the claustrum in several major diseases, and by the suggestion that the claustrum may have a role in consciousness. Here we propose a series of experiments to test the novel hypothesis that the claustrum is part of the default mode network, a group of brain areas that act together when we aren't thinking about anything in particular, that is- most of the time."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Monash Univer...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Monash University","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-507067","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/28","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/75731","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141463","size":1}
