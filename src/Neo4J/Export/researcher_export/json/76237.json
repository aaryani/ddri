It is the result of a dysfunctional immune system that inappropriately targets and damages the colon. There is increasing evidence that gut bacteria play a crucial role in UC, possibly by stimulating inappropriate activation of immune cells. We believe that by \"transplanting\" the faeces (and thus gut microbes) of healthy individuals into the colon of UC patients, we may change the bacterial make up and correct the inappropriate immune system activation."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of New South Wales","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-593921","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/7","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74835","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76237","size":1}
