Marsupial genomes are uniquely valuable because they provide comparisons that reveal new human genes, regulatory sequences and marsupial-specific genes. These  will deliver new products and information useful for medicine, industry, agriculture and conservation.     We will construct integrated genetic and physical maps of the genome, clone the whole genome as large inserts in BAC vectors, and build a ?golden path? with minimal overlap. We will construct libraries of expressed genes from tammar tissues and array them for use in analysing gene expression.
