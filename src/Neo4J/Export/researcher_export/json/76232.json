Although osteosarcoma begins in bones, the cancer often spreads to other parts of the body. Patients have a very poor chance of survival if their cancer has spread. We will use mouse and human models of osteosarcoma to improve our understanding of how the cancer is different from the normal bone forming cells. This information will help us to find new treatments to improve patient outcomes."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"St Vincent's ...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research","state":"VIC","type":"Research","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/33","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74860","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76232","size":1}
