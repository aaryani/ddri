The recently discovered TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in prostate cancer is unique as dominant fusion translocations are uncommon in solid organ malignancy. Activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is thought to play a role. Understanding the role of AID and downstream DNA repair pathways may be a target for future therapies in cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Centenary Ins...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Centenary Institute of Cancer Medicine and Cell Biology","state":"NSW","type":"Research","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/101","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76115","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76262","size":1}
