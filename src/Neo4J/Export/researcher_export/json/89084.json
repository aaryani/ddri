Multiple studies have identified PV solar electricity as the most promising option for a sustainable energy future, with Australia already at the forefront internationally in Si PV.  The applicants recently have shown that insights from PV also may provide the key to the successful development of active Si photonic devices for integration into microelectronics. The Centre's aims and expected outcomes are to strengthen this technological lead in Si PV while pioneering the development of active Si photonic devices for microelectronic integration, with economic, cultural and social benefits.","scientific_title":"Centre for Advanced Silicon Photovoltaics and Photonics","start_year":2003,"arc_grant_id":"CE0348155","total_budget":"$19,375,000","arc_scheme":"CE","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of New South Wales","state":"NSW","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89069","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89070","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89084","size":1}
