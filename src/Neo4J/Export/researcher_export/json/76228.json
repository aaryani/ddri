These children often have difficulties in understanding teachers in classrooms, which can significantly impact their ability to learn. The developed software will be specifically designed for diagnosing 5-year old children, before they enter primary school, and in contrast to existing tests will be independent of their language background."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Macquarie Uni...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Macquarie University","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-501485","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/216","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74876","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76228","size":1}
