The majority of the morbidity and mortality, which arises with cirrhosis, occurs due to the development of portal hypertension. In cirrhosis unexplained vasodilatation of the splanchnic circulation occurs contributing significantly to portal hypertension. I expect to confirm through my experiments that the ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis (alternate RAS) is responsible for this vasodilatation and that antagonists targeting this system may have a role in therapy."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76099","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76245","size":1}
