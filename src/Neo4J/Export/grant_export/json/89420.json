This research project aims to identify and characterise new genes involved in the copper regulation of the Alzheimer's disease gene.  This may lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets and clinical intervention strategies as well as early diagnostic procedures in preventative healthcare for the treatment of AD. The benefits would affect the international community as a whole, potentially minimising the socio-economic costs arising from the predicted world-wide increase in AD in the ageing population.","scientific_title":"Identification and Characterisation of Genes involved in the Copper Regulation of the Human Alzheimer's Disease Amyloid-Beta Precursor Protein (APP) Gene","start_year":2005,"arc_grant_id":"DI0560757","total_budget":"$160,896","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Melbourne","state":"Vic","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89196","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr SA Belling...","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0560757:Mr SA Bellingham; A/Prof J Camakaris; Prof DK Lahiri; Dr R Cappai; Prof CL Masters","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Mr SA Bellingham; A/Prof J Camakaris; Prof DK Lahiri; Dr R Cappai; Prof CL Masters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89421","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89420","size":1}
