The coupling of the two processes will allow us to examine the interaction between heat and water flow. The project also aims to extend the heat component of the flow model to granulated heterogeneous soils by developing a model that encapsulates heat effects at the microscopic and macroscopic level.  The model will be applied to two problems 1) hydraulic barriers in cover liner designs for landfills and 2) assessing the ability of heat sensors to measure various soil properties under field conditions.","scientific_title":"Modelling of coupled heat and water flow through layered soils with an extension to heat flow through granulated soils","start_year":2004,"arc_grant_id":"DI0453648","total_budget":"$144,184","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Griffith Univ...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"Griffith University","state":"Qld","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-465942","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89385","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr CJ Matthew...","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0453648:Dr CJ Matthews; Dr RD Braddock; Dr FJ Cook; Dr JH Knight","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Dr CJ Matthews; Dr RD Braddock; Dr FJ Cook; Dr JH Knight"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89411","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89410","size":1}
