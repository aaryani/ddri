However, only 38% of all cancer patients receive radiotherapy in Australia. Advanced cancer patients may be missing out on radiotherapy because they are not referred for palliative radiotherapy. The specific aims of this study are to: Explore the primary care approach to patients with advanced cancer and particularly those who require radiotherapy; Define factors that influence how Australian GPs respond to symptoms of advanced cancer; Map the patientsï¿½ perspective on current referral practice for palliative care. This project will be comprised of three stages: simulated consultations with GPs, survey of GPs and patient interviews. These methods will enable researchers to develop an understanding of the primary care approach to patients with advanced cancer and those who require radiotherapy and how patients with advanced disease are referred for treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Curtin Univer...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Curtin University of Technology","state":"WA","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-611898","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/175","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62307","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Examination o...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Disruptions","Palliative care","culture","ethics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":180409,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Examination of cultural and ethical core components of palliative care","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Human Bioethics","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Jennifer Philip","higher_grant_type":"SRDC - People","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/180409","simplified_title":"Palliative Care","sub_type":"Medical Scholarship - Palliative Care","total_budget":"103028.92","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Alfred Hospital","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Alfred Hospital","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-468477","type":"Hospital","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/167","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3001","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141302","size":1}],"class":"Dataset","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141304","size":1}
