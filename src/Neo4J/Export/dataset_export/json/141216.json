The project will focus on the evolution of mate choice in the Western Australian rainbowfish, which has never been formally studied. Our research will therefore work towards a better understanding of Australian native fauna. Conceptually, the work encompasses new and innovative experimental procedures that will address fundamental questions in sexual selection. The results will ultimately be geared towards publication in the highest ranking journals, thereby promoting Australian science on the international stage. Australian science will further benefit from the training of young scientists.","scientific_title":"Sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in sexual selection","start_year":2007,"arc_grant_id":"DP0772498","total_budget":"$340,841","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Western Australia","state":"WA","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89390","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/102509","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Alternative r...","data":{"research_area":"ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","research_area_code":"2707","application_year":2005,"purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP0663746","description":"This research is focussed at the highest level in the field of evolutionary biology; testing recent theory for the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics and using these species to test hypotheses about adaptation.

Australian students will benefit from exposure to high quality international collaborators. We will also increase our understanding of the biology of the European earwig, a pest species in Australia.
