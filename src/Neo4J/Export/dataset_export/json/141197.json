The proposal involves collaborations with high-profile researchers from three European countries and will increase Australia's standing as a world-leader in evolutionary biology. Australian students will benefit from exposure to high quality international collaborators. We will also increase our understanding of the biology of the European earwig, a pest species in Australia. Reproductive tactics are exciting topics for media attention and this research will reach a wide and interested Australian and world audience.","scientific_title":"Alternative reproductive tactics and threshold evolution","start_year":2006,"arc_grant_id":"DP0663746","total_budget":"$185,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Universit...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Western Australia","state":"WA","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89390","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/100126","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141195","size":1}],"class":"Dataset","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141197","size":1}
