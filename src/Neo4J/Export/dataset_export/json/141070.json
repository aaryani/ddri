This will fill a critical gap between ecological theory and real-world populations and initiate a major shift in how we view the relationship between environments and the species that inhabit them. Natural resource use practices like forestry are rarely considered compatible with biodiversity conservation. This research will provide on-the-ground management recommendations to integrate such land uses with conservation, thereby providing both economic and conservation benefits to the Australian community.","scientific_title":"Life history responses to habitat heterogeneity and implications for conservation","start_year":2009,"arc_grant_id":"DP0984876","total_budget":"$290,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Australia...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The Australian National University","state":"ACT","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89130","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/109853","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141068","size":1}],"class":"Dataset","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141070","size":1}
