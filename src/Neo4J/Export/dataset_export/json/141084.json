From a conservation perspective, the project will produce a benchmark about management of fish resources. We will investigate questions related to important conservation issues (including the recovery plan of a nationally threatened species) and the management of stocking activities in recreational fisheries of coastal and inland waters. The latter is particularly relevant to rural communities since they provide both social and economic benefits to rural people.","scientific_title":"Phylogeography, Conservation Genetics and Stocking Management of Perches and Basses","start_year":2006,"arc_grant_id":"LP0667952","total_budget":"$227,000","arc_scheme":"LP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Macquarie Uni...","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"Macquarie University","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-501485","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/90814","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/121249","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141082","size":1}],"class":"Dataset","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141084","size":1}
