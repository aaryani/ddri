This may explain how lifestyle factors influence what genes do, and we hope our findings will help to develop future prevention strategies for these cancers."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Cancer Counci...","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"Cancer Council Victoria","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-1307127","type":"Other","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/73903","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Complex stati...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["breast cancer","prostate cancer","informatics","statistics","computers"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1033452,"application_year":2011,"health_keywords":["genetics","gene-environment interaction","epidemiology"],"scientific_title":"Complex statistical analyses of genome-wide association studies related to breast and prostate cancers using high performance supercomputing","start_year":2012,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biostatistics","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"STATISTICS","cia_name":"Prof John Hopper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1033452","simplified_title":"Complex statistical analyses of genome-wide association studies related to breast and prostate cancers using high performance supercomputing","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"656073.25","source_system":"Breast and prostate cancers are the most common cancers in Australian women and men.
