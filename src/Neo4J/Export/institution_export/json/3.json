We have tested this technique in laboratory animals and in people with diabetes and have shown it is effective in some. We now propose to test this technique in a large sample of people similar to the participants in the successful group of our pilot study - 55-65 year old people with diabetes of shorter duration. In addition, older people up to 75 years of age, with up to 10 years duration of diabetes will be included separately. If successful, the electrical stimulation could improve sensation leading to fewer ulcerations and amputations. Much suffering and expense would be avoided. - The magnitude of reduction in suffering and expense can be judged from the fact that people with diabetes have 15 times the risk of amputation as do people without diabetes. In Australia half of non-traumatic amputations are done to people with diabetes. Foot ulcers precede amputations in most cases, and in themselves cause much suffering and expense. Australia needs to act on this now because, if current trends continue, the number of people with diabetes will increase as the population ages. -The number of people aged over 65 will increase from around 2.3 million at present to over 6 million in the next half century. The increase in those over 85 will be even more marked with numbers increasing four fold to over one million people.

An increase in protein excretion in the urine (albuminuria) is usually the first sign of kidney disease. Albuminuria usually progresses from normal levels to an intermediate phase (microalbuminuria) lasting 5-10 years and is then followed by overt nephropathy (macroalbuminuria). It has been traditionally believed that onset of a decline in kidney function, measured as glomerular filtration rate, accompanies the development of diabetic kidney disease. However, recent studies by our group have shown that about one quarter of patients with type 2 diabetes have impaired kidney function without an increase in albuminuria. This raises the possibility that an alternate non-albuminuric pathway leads to kidney disease in a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes. This study will compare kidney structure and function in patients with type 2 diabetes and impaired kidney function with or without increases in albuminuria. The comparison will be accompanied by measurements of the rate of decline in kidney function over 5 years or more, in subjects with or without increases in albuminuria in order to confirm that kidney function may decline independently of albuminuria. The demonstration of alternate mechanisms of renal injury has the potential to identify new targets for the treatment of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Si...","data":{"first_name":"Sianna","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003836","middle_name":"","last_name":"Panagiotopoulos","source_individual_id":"RMIS5173","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Sianna Panagiotopoulos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77733","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025771","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jerums","source_individual_id":"RMIS6566","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof George Jerums"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83640","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014601","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Macisaac","source_individual_id":"5016131","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Richard Macisaac"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80651","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027405","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Power","source_individual_id":"RMIS60084","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Power"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84076","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4930","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"NHMRC...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"nhmrc_grant_id":9000072,"application_year":2010,"start_year":2010,"scientific_title":"NHMRC Standard Equipment Grant _ 2010","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Dr Sianna Panagiotopoulos","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/9000072","simplified_title":"NHMRC Standard Equipment Grant _ 2010","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"8952","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Si...","data":{"first_name":"Sianna","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003836","middle_name":"","last_name":"Panagiotopoulos","source_individual_id":"RMIS5173","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Sianna Panagiotopoulos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77733","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/72279","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"IRIIS...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"nhmrc_grant_id":9000169,"application_year":2013,"start_year":2013,"scientific_title":"IRIISS -

This process is responsible for many of the life-threatening complications of liver disease, however, the mechanisms responsible are not completely understood and there are no established treatments. The aetiologies of cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, are many and vary from viral hepatitis to inherited and autoimmune disorders. Regardless of the cause, it appears that fibrosis develops down a common pathway leading to eventual cirrhosis. We will study the pathways that are thought to be involved in the stimulation of liver scarring, in particular, focusing on those that lead to its activation and perpetuation. It is hypothesised that these pathways will prove to be potential targets for the treatment and prevention of liver fibrosis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Louise","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041380","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Burrell","source_individual_id":"RMIS151859","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Louise Burrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87729","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035115","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Angus","source_individual_id":"5013205","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Angus"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86103","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3003","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Hypoxiain oncology","Positron emission tomography","Tumor response to treatment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":469002,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Growth factor overexpression","Tumor hypoxia","renal cell carcinoma","squamous cell carcinoma"],"scientific_title":"Novel tools for the imaging of tumor hypoxia using PET","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Uwe Ackermann","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/469002","simplified_title":"Imaging of tumor oxygen levels using nuclear medicine","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"727855.97","source_system":"Fast growing tumors often outgrow the ability of blood vessels to properly supply them with nutrients and oxygen.

This laboratory research will involve researchers across a number of centres in Australia. The research is focused on the effects of a new targeted cancer drug called cetuximab. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathway is an important cause of NSCLC in many patients, and this is blocked by cetuximab. The advent of new targeted cancer therapies, which block specific cancer pathways in the cell, has highlighted the need for detailed knowledge about how these therapies work at the molecular level, so that we can make best use of them. The laboratory studies will be on tissues taken from patients with NSCLC who are receiving chemotherapy then going on to surgery to have the cancers removed. Tumour samples will be taken prior to treatment, and then the surgical resection will also be analysed. Sequential blood samples will also be taken. Prior to surgery, patients will receive a 9 week course of chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel to shrink the cancer. In addition, some patients will be randomised to receive cetuximab along with chemotherapy. In the laboratory, we will investigate whether various measures of activation of the EGFR pathway in the cancer and in blood predict for response to cetuximab. We will also investigate how the changes in tumour with cetuximab treatment differ from tumours not treated with the drug. We will be examining the genes and proteins of EGFR and those of a number of related pathways. a number of related receptor, along with From this we will attempt to understand which patients benefit most from the drug and also in what specific ways the cancer cells are affected by the treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006998","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dobrovic","source_individual_id":"RMIS17767","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Alexander Dobrovic"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78599","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Adrienne","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015064","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Morey","source_individual_id":"RMIS4530547","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Adrienne Morey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80777","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003431","middle_name":"Leslie Ross","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5025874","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Paul Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77616","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Edouard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027033","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Nice","source_individual_id":"RMIS452792","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Edouard Nice"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83994","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60973","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Precl...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","beta amyloid","organic chemistry","positron emission tomography","radiolabeling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":582402,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","Dementia","Non-invasive, pathological diagnosis","cognitive disorders"],"scientific_title":"Preclinical evaluation of F-18 fluoroethyltriazolyl PEGstilbenes as potential PET imaging agents for Alzheimers disease","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nuclear Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Uwe Ackermann","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/582402","simplified_title":"New PET imaging agents for Alzheimers disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"673238.27","source_system":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is becoming am ever increasing burden to the health system due to the aging of our population.

While medical complications are implicated in these problems, recent evidence points to the added effect of the infant's early environment. Hospitalised premature infants experience stress from necessary but painful hospital procedures, overstimulation and maternal deprivation. Evidence, largely from animal studies, suggests stressful early experience negatively affects brain development. We also know that premature infants find it difficult to handle stress as they are highly disorganised neurobehaviourally. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a parent-based intervention in enhancing neurobehavioural development at two years of age in very premature infants. It is predicted that this stress-reduction intervention will also enhance medical stability,normal brain development, parent-child interaction and parental mental health. The intervention to be trialled involves intensive training of parents of very premature infants, and in the 12 weeks following birth the parents will be the change agents. A randomised controlled trial comparing intervention and control groups will be undertaken to assess the effectiveness of this intervention. Assessments of early brain and 2 year intellectual, emotional and behavioural development will provide important outcome measures. A major strength of this study is the inclusion of advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology as it enables differences in brain development between the intervention and control group to be assessed, the association between brain and neurobehavioural development to be explored, and the impact of stress on early brain development to be investigated. This intervention is relatively simple and inexpensive, and would be a valuable contribution to neonatal care if found to be effective in enhancing brain and neurobehavioural development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003207","middle_name":"Russell","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS108696","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77554","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Terrie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037450","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Inder","source_individual_id":"5015414","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Terrie Inder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86700","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Jeannette","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014992","middle_name":"","last_name":"Milgrom","source_individual_id":"RMIS2357707","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jeannette Milgrom"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80762","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6819","size":1}],"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3","size":1}
