Termed peri-prosthetic osteolysis (PO), this bone loss can result in the loosening and ultimate failure and need for revision of the artificial joint components. PO is thought to be caused by the body's reaction to wear particles generated from the articulating surface of the prosthesis. However, it has not previously been possible to accurately explore the relationship between prothesis wear and PO, or the progression of PO, because of a lack of techniques to image and measure the volume of PO around metal prosthesis components. We have developed a means to accurately and reproducibly measure the volume of bone loss, using CT, and will do so longitudinally in joint replacement patients to obtain the first information about the progression of PO. New computer based methods will be used concurrently to relate prosthesis wear and migration parameters to PO. Patients who come to surgery for replacement of failed prostheses will be investigated further by analysis of the tissues involved in the bone loss around prostheses. Basic science experiments will seek to understand the underlying causes of PO and the findings will be important in interpreting the clinical results. An animal model will be used to seek approaches to inhibiting the pathological response to wear particles. The significance of these studies is that they will lead to improved outcomes for joint replacement patients, increasing the interval to revision surgery, which is both extremely costly and brings an attendant morbidity and mortality."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Donald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037378","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Howie","source_individual_id":"RMIS18497","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Donald Howie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86682","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002107","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Haynes","source_individual_id":"RMIS18488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Haynes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77248","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Ma...","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0026624","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mcgee","source_individual_id":"RMIS1590217","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Margaret Mcgee"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83882","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4401","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Road ...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2000,"keywords":["BIOMECHANICS","BRAIN INJURY","IMPACT","PHYSIOLOGY","PATHOLOGY"],"nhmrc_grant_id":943301,"application_year":1993,"start_year":1994,"scientific_title":"Road Accident Research Unit","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Allan McLean","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Block Funding","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/943301","simplified_title":"Road Accident Research Unit","sub_type":"Research Unit Grant","total_budget":"2149959.79","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Allan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026662","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mclean","source_individual_id":"RMIS112262","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Allan Mclean"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83896","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Tempo...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Drosophila cell death","apoptosis gene regulation","apoptosis/programmed cell death","caspases/ caspase activation","steroid hormones"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250349,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cancer","degenerative disorders","developmental defects"],"scientific_title":"Temporal and spatial regulation of caspases in development and metamorphosis","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Extensive apoptosis occurs during foetal development which is required to get rid of many excess cells produced during the growth of the embryo. Selective apoptosis is also essential for the formation of different tissues and organs in developing foetus. In the adult, apoptosis is required for proper functioning of the immune system, to remove virus infected and cancer cells and in general to maintain the correct number of cells in the body. As such, misregulated apoptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of a wide array of diseases such as autoimmune diseases, many forms of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), heart disease, ischaemia and other conditions. To understand, manage and treat disorders that result from aberrant apoptosis, we need to know at molecular and cellular level, how apoptosis is brought about and how it is regulated. We have been studying these processes in detail for several years. Central to the apoptotic execution of cell death are a group of proteases that target many cellular proteins for specific cleavage. The activation of these proteases is the crucial step in the initiation of apoptosis and therefore each cell has developed complex ways to control this process. In the present proposal, we aim to study regulation of caspases that are involved in developmental apoptosis. Furthermore, we plan to identify proteins that are responsible for the regulation of caspase activation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Sharad","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008480","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kumar","source_individual_id":"RMIS11591","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78992","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4402","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Studi...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["EAE","chemokine","cytotoxicity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250359,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["inflammation","multiple sclerosis","transplantation"],"scientific_title":"Studies on the role of the MIP-3beta/SLC system in the priming phase of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Shaun McColl","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250359","simplified_title":"Homeostatic chemokines and cytotoxic immunity","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"425250","source_system":"Generation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is important for defence against viruses and cancer cells.

In particular, the areas most affected appear to be intelligence, memory, behaviour and attentional capacity . Currently it is unclear whether these deficits are due to sleep disruption or reduced nocturnal oxygen levels. The treatment of upper airway obstruction is the removal of adenoids and tonsils, however, it is unknown whether or not this improves the child's intellectual capacity. This study aims to be one of the first to critically evaluate the impact of upper airway obstruction during sleep on children's intelligence, memory, behaviour and attentional capacity, and the improvements wrought by the removal of the child's tonsils and adenoids."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Kurt","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020519","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lushington","source_individual_id":"5016085","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Kurt Lushington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82241","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025945","middle_name":"Declan","last_name":"Kennedy","source_individual_id":"5015683","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr John Kennedy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83693","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000187","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Baghurst","source_individual_id":"5013272","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76706","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4405","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Inhib...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Androgen receptor","Breast cancer","Estrogen receptor","HER2/neu","Ligand-independent activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250373,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Advanced breast cancer","Androgen therapy of breast cancer","Inhibition of estrogen signalling"],"scientific_title":"Inhibition of estrogen signalling by androgen receptors: a potential mechanism for suppression of breast cancer growth.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250373","simplified_title":"Inhibition of estrogen signalling and breast cancer cell growth by the androgen receptor.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"525000","source_system":"Breast cancer is a major health problem in Western countries including Australia, where it is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Breast cells require female sex hormones, called estrogens, for their growth and survival and consequently most current treatments for breast cancer aim to block the actions of these hormones in breast cancer cells. However there is still a large proportion of women who do not respond to these therapies or have an initial response but subsequently develop resistance. Evidence from our laboratory and others indicates that the male sex hormones, androgens, also play an important role in breast cancer. Androgens oppose the effects of estrogens in breast cancer cells, and inhibit their growth. Historically androgens were used to treat patients with advanced breast cancer, with good results, but the masculinising side effects (eg excess hair growth and acne) of these hormones led to a discontinuation of their use since the 1960s. The major objective of our current studies is to determine how androgens can stop breast cancer cells from growing by investigating the effects of the androgen receptor, which mediates the growth regulatory effects of androgens, in breast cancer cells. We believe that a better understanding of this signalling pathway could potentially lead to new treatments for breast cancer that act more specifically to inhibit cancer growth without the unpleasant side effects of androgenic drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr St...","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000412","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Birrell","source_individual_id":"RMIS229478","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Stephen Birrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76762","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028408","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS102344","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Lisa","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029717","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"5013717","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Lisa Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84691","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4406","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mecha...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["afferent stimulation","human","motor cortex","sensory cortex","stroke rehabilitation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250394,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cortical plasticity","motor function","sensory function","stroke rehabilitation"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of cortical plasticity and facilitation of functional recovery following stroke","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Michael Ridding","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250394","simplified_title":"Induced functional recovery following stroke","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"427500","source_system":"Specific regions of the human brain have been shown to reorganise following damage to the brain or peripheral nerves. This reorganisation is seen in both young and older subjects and is thought to be useful in helping to restore function. For example, following a stroke a patient may, initially, be unable to move one arm. However, in the following weeks and months some function may return. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for this improvement. However, it is likely that at least some of the improvement is due to reorganisation within the sensorimotor cortex. Following the stroke the control of the arm may be taken over by adjacent undamaged regions of the brain. This reorganisation allows impressive functional recoveries to occur. We have preliminary evidence to support the idea that patterns of activity generated in peripheral nerves (afferent input) following stroke may be crucial for the development of the organisational changes seen within the brain. We have shown that by applying specific patterns of sensory input we are able to produce organisational changes within the motor cortex of control subjects. Also, we have been able to induce similar changes in stroke patients. These changes have been accompanied by improvements in motor control. These novel and exciting findings support our hypothesis that by applying certain patterns of afferent input to patients following stroke we will be able to facilitate functional recovery by maximising reoganisation within the cortex. In the present project we will establish the organisation patterns in the brain of stroke patients and contrast the findings with control subjects. Secondly we will investigate the potential for facilitating recovery of stroke patients by the application of specific patterns of afferent input.

Treatment aims to keep the mother's blood sugar normal and to prevent extra sugar transferring to the baby, as this can lead to elevated insulin levels, and subsequent complications, in the baby. Initial treatment is by diet, but more than 30% of women need further treatment with insulin injections. Metformin, which can be taken by as a tablet, is an alternative to insulin that is used widely outside pregnancy for people with diabetes. There are good data to support the safety of metformin in pregnancy. We plan to test that metformin is not only safe but also an effective alternative to insulin for women with GDM. Metformin works by reducing resistance to insulin, which is a key factor for the development of GDM and also for high blood pressure complications. We hope to demonstrate a reduction in these complications with metformin treatment. Metformin is associated with less weight gain than insulin and we hope to demonstrate an associated reduction in the risk of diabetes following pregnancy in women with GDM treated with metformin. It is likely that metformin crosses the placenta, and if so, it may reduce elevated insulin levels in the baby. The study will measure insulin levels in the cord blood, hoping to demonstrate that more babies have normal insulin levels in pregnancies treated with metformin."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Jeremy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021193","middle_name":"Nicolle","last_name":"Oats","source_individual_id":"5016770","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jeremy Oats"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82432","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031071","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Hague","source_individual_id":"5015026","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof William Hague"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85050","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019503","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Haslam","source_individual_id":"RMIS207731","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Ross Haslam"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81965","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Pe...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018591","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Davoren","source_individual_id":"RMIS1590864","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Peter Davoren"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81764","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4410","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Obesi...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2017,"keywords":["pregnancy","obesity","infant","maternal nutrition","maternal and child health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1073514,"application_year":2013,"start_year":2014,"scientific_title":"Obesity during pregnancy: how can we improve health outcomes for women, infants and children?","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PAEDIATRICS AND REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE","cia_name":"Dr Rosalie Grivell","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1073514","simplified_title":"Improving outcomes for women who are obese in pregnancy","sub_type":"Australian Clincal Research ECF","total_budget":"369434.12","source_system":"Obesity is a common issue facing Australian women and has a role to play in health in pregnancy, birth and later life for the woman and her children.

With aging of the population, it is projected that this proportion will increase to more than 13% over the next 20 years. When it is considered that the direct hospital and residential care costs attributable to osteoporotic fractures currently approaches $2 billion per annum, low-cost interventions for increasing bone strength which are easily applied to the elderly population have enormous potential for health benefits in Australia. Thus study will examine the effects of dietary omega-3 fats, of the kind found in fish and fish oil, on the biology of bone metabolism and on bone strength. The results will provide information which may be used in developing simple drug or dietary strategies for large-scale use for increasing bone mass and strength in the elderly population. A strength of the study arises from the combination of research expertise in (a) dietary fats, and (b) molecular biology of bone cells, and (c) animal models of bone metabolism which are amenable to dietary interventions. This combination is unique, but builds on well established systems which hitherto have existed in separate research paradigms. The Chief Investigator has considerable experience in development of diets enriched in omega-3 fats which are practical and suitable for daily use on a long-term basis. This adds considerably to the potential significance of the outcomes because, if favourable effects of omega-3 fats are observed and are characterised with regard to mechanisms, the results can be rapidly translated into large-scale clinical use."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Leslie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018309","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Cleland","source_individual_id":"RMIS120886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leslie Cleland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81689","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Howard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032696","middle_name":"Arthur","last_name":"Morris","source_individual_id":"5011839","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Howard Morris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85470","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4411","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The i...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Adjuvant arthritis","Cellular immunology","Dendritic cells","Inflammation","T lymphocytes"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250426,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Immunotherapy","Pathogenesis","Polyarthritis","Rheumatoid arthritis"],"scientific_title":"The immunological microenvironment in the synovium during experimental polyarthritis in the rat","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Graham Mayrhofer","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250426","simplified_title":"How inflammation in the joints is regulated in arthritis of the rheumatoid-type","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"473250","source_system":"In this project, we aim to understand the process by which some forms of arthritis, as exemplified by rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cause inflammation and destruction of multiple joints. Such forms of arthritis are referred to collectively as polyarthritis. There is a strong evidence that RA has an immunological basis and that abnormal recognition of components of the joints by T lymphocytes orchestrates the inflammation that is characteristic of the disease. We believe that dispersal of disease-causing activated T lymphocytes in the blood accounts for the involvement of many joints. We have used a model of polyarthritis in rats to study the nature of the activated T lymphocytes, where they come from, how they are delivered to the blood stream and how they enter the joints. This project focuses on the crucial tissues that line the joints. We want to understand how the disease-causing activated T cells cause inflammation and how the immune system reacts to restrain them. We can undertake this work because we have developed three unique tools. Firstly, we can transfer arthritis with activated T lymphocytes and, therefore, study their behavior in an otherwise normal body. In this way, we can see how the body responds to the presence of disease causing cells. Secondly, we have introduced a genetic marker, which is essential if one wishes to distinguish the separate activities of the donor' and host cells. Thirdly, we can collect cells from the diseased paws, allowing us to examine their activities in vitro as well as in vivo. This model offers the opportunity to study the activities of the disease-causing cells and to identify points at which the disease cycle can be broken. It will allow us to design and-or test new treatments aimed at these points."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Leslie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018309","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Cleland","source_individual_id":"RMIS120886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leslie Cleland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81689","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044096","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mayrhofer","source_individual_id":"RMIS155314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Graham Mayrhofer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88428","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4412","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The e...","data":{"media_summary":"pregnancy","end_year":2004,"keywords":["child development","iron","maternal nutrition","pregnancy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250431,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["child development","iron deficiency","maternal and child health","maternal nutrition program","pregnancy"],"scientific_title":"The effect of iron supplementation in pregnancy on child cognitive development","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nutrition and Dietetics","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Maria Makrides","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250431","simplified_title":"Iron in pregnancy and child cognitive development","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"91562.5","source_system":"During fetal life the brain grows very rapidly and animal studies have shown that inadequate iron nutrition of mothers during pregnancy can result in permanent structural and developmental problems in the offspring.

It may be that the critical period where iron nutrition influences later development is in fetal life (during pregnancy). We have the opportunity to test whether iron nutrition in fetal life influences childhood development by assessing the cognitive abilities of children who were in our earlier study of iron supplementation in pregnancy. Our aim is to assess the children at 4 years to determine if iron nutrition in pregnancy predicts development. This may change the dietary advice we give pregnant women to ensure they give their babies the best start in life."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032291","middle_name":"","last_name":"Makrides","source_individual_id":"5011980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Maria Makrides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000187","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Baghurst","source_individual_id":"5013272","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76706","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4413","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regio...","data":{"media_summary":"Stem Cell Therapy","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Cell Differentiation","Developmental Neurobiology","Embryonic Stem Cell","Neurodegeneration","Neuronal Differentiation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250436,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Cell Growth/Differentiation","Cell Therapy","Embryonic Development","Neurodegenerative Disease","Stem Cell Therapy"],"scientific_title":"Regionalisation and differentiation of EPL-derived neurectoderm: directed formation of dopaminergic neurons in vitro.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

For example, dopaminergic neurons are lost progressively in Parkinson's Disease. A potential method of treatment is 'cell therapy' which envisages transplantation of cells back to the site of cell loss, and restoration of function. Application of the cell therapy approach is limited by the unavailability of cells for transplantation. Embryonic stem (ES) cells provide a potential solution to this problem because they can be grown in unlimited numbers and differentiated to any kind of cell that is found in the embryo or adult. In this application we propose to continue our work on controlling the differentiation of ES cells to neural lineages. Production of dopaminergic neurons will be a particular focus. We will establish conditions that enable the production of these cells in a manner that is therapeutically relevant and predicted to be acceptable to regulatory authorities. Cells will be tested by transplantation into adult rats to assess their therapeutic potential, in particular persistence, integration and differentiation within the brain environment. Research required to achieve the production of transplantable cells will also provide basic information about the mechanisms by which the mammalian embryo allocates cells, specifically cells of the nervous system, to specific lineages during embryogenesis. This information will be important for the production of other neural cell types, which have therapeutic potential for treatment of diseases like stroke, motor neuron disease and spinal cord injury."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033337","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Rathjen","source_individual_id":"RMIS192806","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Rathjen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85632","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4414","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gastr...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Endocrine Diseases","Gastroenterology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250453,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Gastroduodenal motility and glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology and Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Karen Jones","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250453","simplified_title":"Gastroduodenal motility and glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus","sub_type":"Clinical CDF","total_budget":"435500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002495","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Jones","source_individual_id":"5015532","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Karen Jones"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77345","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4415","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Does ...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["obesity","glucose metabolism","lipid metabolism","insulin resistance","energy expenditure"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1023401,"application_year":2011,"health_keywords":["mitochondrial function"],"scientific_title":"Does periodic fasting improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health in humans?","start_year":2012,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Leonie Heilbronn","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1023401","simplified_title":"Does periodic fasting improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health in humans?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"844018.59","source_system":"A large body of evidence for the health benefits and life-extending properties of dietary restriction exists.

Vertebral deformity, intervertebral disc disorganisation, and change to vertebral bone structure are features associated with degeneration of the spine and with back pain. Degenerative disc disease is one of the major causes of back symptoms and is believed to be associated with degeneration of the spine. Spinal degeneration includes disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, compromised vertebral body bone quality, muscle and ligament alterations. It is assumed that these changes result in increased or abnormal spine motion and modified load distribution across the spinal joint. It has been found that with age, there is increased disorganisation of the intervertebral disc and decreased quality of vertebral cancellous bone. However, bones with the same density within the range of normal subjects, can show selective loss of bone structure and reduced load-bearing capacities of these vertebrae. An important concept here is that even for a given bone mass, fracture risk increases with age, supporting the view that there is a component of bone fragility that is independent of mass. Increased bone fragility may be associated with compromised cancellous bone structure. While the relationship between disc degeneration and changes in vertebral bone is commonly invoked, the mechanisms of this relationship have largely been overlooked, with age changes given more attention. However, it may be that intervertebral disc disorganisation modulates age-related bone changes within the spine. Disc degeneration may influence trabecular bone responses before changes with age put the patient at risk of vertebral crush fracture. We propose that the mature disc cannot effectively regenerate after damage, and thus responses to disc damage will be more readily observed in vertebral bone architecture than in the disc."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Trevo...","data":{"first_name":"Trevor","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0025413","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hearn","source_individual_id":"RMIS151546","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Trevor Hearn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83541","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Nicola (Nick)","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007214","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Fazzalari","source_individual_id":"RMIS5831069","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78651","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4390","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The i...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Oral epidemiology","Oral treatment needs","Provision of dental services","Use of dental services"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250316,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Dental caries","Periodontal disease","Tooth loss"],"scientific_title":"The impact of declining tooth loss on oral health status and dental care utilisation","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dentistry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"Dr David Brennan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250316","simplified_title":"The impact of declining tooth loss","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"144375","source_system":"Improved oral health has been well documented in Australia. Over recent decades the average number of decayed teeth among children has decreased. Among adults, the percentage with no natural teeth has also exhibited a decrease over time. While increased retention of natural teeth is an indicator of improved oral health status within the population, there may be some unexpected consequences of this success. Improved oral health has been associated with increased rather then decreased use of services. Improvements in oral health manifested in the form of greater tooth retention, coupled with demographic trends towards growth in the population, may lead to an increased risk of oral disease with flow on effects on need and demand for care. Findings from one cross-sectional study in the USA have shown that people who retained higher numbers of teeth had more periodontal disease and dental caries experience, and reported a past pattern of visiting the dentist more frequently. The specific aims of this project are to examine the association of the number of natural teeth among middle-aged Australians with their oral health status, treatment needs and subsequent use of dental services. The outcome of this project will provide answers to two research questions. Firstly, it will see whether the retention of more teeth among adults is associated with higher levels of oral disease. Secondly, by following people over time it will be able to detect whether those who are retaining more teeth into adult age ranges have higher levels of use of dental services than their counterparts with fewer teeth. The answers to both of these research questions has significance for policy and planning in the area of dental public health by providing evidence as to the size and direction of expected future demand for and use of dental services in Australia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"A.

Adults who occupy higher positions on the social hierarchy experienced less disease and symptom experience, enhanced quality of life, and better self-rated oral health. Not only were associations made between social position and oral health, but a range of other factors such as personal control, social support, stress, life satisfaction, and workplace and childhood social environments were also associated with oral wellness. This work is new Australian research and is yet to be published. In an expansion of this project, we move from describing oral health inequalities and identifying their social determinants to provide a better understanding of pathways to population oral health. In doing so we shift the focus from the individual to the social context in which individuals live. We suggest that characteristics of social environments contribute independently to the variation in oral health outcomes accounted for by the characteristics of the residents themselves. In particular, we seek to demonstrate that social cohesion (the social integration, trust, and reciprocity within an area) influences conditions linked to oral health. Previous research has demonstrated variation in health according to area. Such studies are able to demonstrate a clustering of health, but are not able to distinguish whether observed social patterns in health reflect characteristics of residents or some feature of the area itself. Such conclusions require multilevel statistical models designed to separate individual effects from contextual effects while simultaneously examining interactions between both levels. Oral health is ideally suited as a proxy for general health because of the ubiquity of dental diseases, the broad utilisation of dental services within the population, and the shared risk factors between oral disease and a wide range chronic health conditions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr Kn...","data":{"first_name":"Knute","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006439","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Carter","source_individual_id":"RMIS376193","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr Knute Carter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78448","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"A.

Part of this testing involves ensuring that, within the body, they are not converted to chemically reactive forms able to damage DNA, since DNA damage can lead to cell toxicity or the development of cancer. Our laboratories have recently identified a new mechanism by which the body converts drugs to reactive chemicals called ester glucuronides. We have shown that some ester glucuronides can damage DNA. A large number of different drugs have the potential to form ester glucuronides. However, we do not know whether all ester glucuronides cause DNA damage or, if only some do, what properties determine their DNA damaging potential. In addition, most of the current pre-clinical screening of drugs can not detect DNA damage caused by ester glucuronides. We believe this lack of knowledge is of serious concern. Therefore, this project aims to: i) screen a large number of drugs for ester glucuronide-mediated DNA damage; ii) develop some preliminary methods of predicting the DNA damaging potency of these reactive chemicals; and iii) develop a screening test that may be more suitable for detecting DNA damage by ester glucuronides during pre-clinical testing.

The disease is incurable once it spreads beyond the confines of the prostate gland. Hormonal treatments can keep the cancer at bay for a number of years until they are no longer effective. Hormonal treatments cause shrinkage of prostate cancer because they interfere the function of the male hormone, testosterone, which encourages growth of prostate cancer. Hence, there is a need for other treatments that may improve the quality of life and survival of prostate cancer patients. It appears that a cancer patient can make immune cells known as T cells, which can recognise his own tumour but which are prevented from destroying the tumour. Using a mouse model of prostate cancer, we wish to understand how prostate tumours act to prevent immune destruction in circumstances that are common to the treatment of human prostate cancer. For example, hormonal treatments produce dead prostate cancer cells that will be cleared by the body's professional scavenger cells in a way that suppresses an active immune response against the tumour. To learn how the removal of dead cells suppresses the immune response, we propose to perturb the normal clearance of dead prostate cells by at least two means. First, we will study mice that have an inherited deficiency in the removal of dead cells. Second, these mice will be given a growth factor to produce an excess of immune stimulating cells known as dendritic cells in the prostate gland. The dendritic cell is the main type of cell that initiates immune responses. We will investigate whether the greater number of dendritic cells, which were put into the prostate gland by the growth factor, can remove the dead prostate cells in a way that excites rather than suppresses the anti-tumour immune response. Positive results obtained from these studies may lead to the design of new treatments for advanced prostate cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000583","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS10107","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76815","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002095","middle_name":"Dominic","last_name":"Hayball","source_individual_id":"5011650","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr John Hayball"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77245","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4394","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Optim...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["child health","nutrition"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250324,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Optimise the nutritional intake of mothers and their infants","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nutrition and Dietetics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Robert Gibson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250324","simplified_title":"Optimise the nutritional intake of mothers and their infants","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"647000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4397","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"DHA f...","data":{"media_summary":"infant, premature","end_year":2007,"keywords":["child development","dietary fatty acids","docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)","infant nutrition","neonatal"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250322,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["breastfeeding","child development","dietary fatty acids","infant feeding","infant, premature"],"scientific_title":"DHA for the Improvement of Neurodevelopmental Outcome in preterm infants: The DINO Trial","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Maria Makrides","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250322","simplified_title":"DHA intake & neurodevelopment of preterm infants","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"631875","source_system":"The incidence of neurological problems that occur in children born prematurely is higher than for those born at term. The earlier that a baby is born, the greater chance it has of having some developmental delay and general inability to cope at school. This has implications for the child, the families and the health system. One of the many dietary factors implicated in the development of neural abilities in premature infants is an omega-3 fatty acid called DHA. This compound is present in breast milk and most preterm formulas and is found in high concentrations in the brain and retina. In the last third of pregnancy the developing baby would normally accumulate DHA at a rapid rate. So it seems reasonable to assume that a baby outside the mother, that is born premature, would also need to accumulate DHA at this same rate. The problem is that none of the milks currently given to premature infants have DHA in high enough concentration to supply this amount of DHA to the baby. For example, breast milk and preterm formulas contain only a third of the DHA required. In order to provide this amount for the premature infant, breast milk containing DHA at about 1% of the total fat is required. Fortunately the level of DHA in breast milk can be increased to this level by supplementing the mothers diet with fish or olis like tuna oil. This study hopes to show that premature babies who receive DHA in amounts similar to that supplied in the womb will develop better than babies who receive low amounts of DHA."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Scott...","data":{"first_name":"Scott","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0026872","middle_name":"","last_name":"Morris","source_individual_id":"RMIS1608632","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Scott Morris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83957","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr An...","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044217","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Mcphee","source_individual_id":"5016412","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Andrew Mcphee"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88458","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032291","middle_name":"","last_name":"Makrides","source_individual_id":"5011980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Maria Makrides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039707","middle_name":"Norrie","last_name":"Simmer","source_individual_id":"5017517","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Karen Simmer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87299","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006885","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Davis","source_individual_id":"RMIS76774","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Davis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78566","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4396","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gastr...","data":{"media_summary":"postprandial hypotension","end_year":2005,"keywords":["diabetes mellitus","duodenum","motility","radioisotopic methods","stomach"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250335,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["diabetes mellitus","gastrointestinal symptoms","gastroparesis","glycaemic control","postprandial hypotension"],"scientific_title":"Gastroduodenal motility and glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250335","simplified_title":"Effects of diabetes on stomach function. - The role of the stomach and glucose absorption in blood glucose control","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"393750","source_system":"The recent application of novel techniques to evaluate gastrointestinal motor function has established that the rate which the stomach empties food is abnormally slow in ~50% of people who have insulin-dependent (type 1) or non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes. Delayed stomach emptying was thought to be an infrequent complication in diabetes; much less common than damage to the eyes, kidneys or nerves. Abnormal stomach emptying may contribute to a number of problems in diabetes, including symptoms such as nausea and bloating, and poor control of blood glucose concentrations. It is now recognised that the blood glucose level itself has a reversible effect on both stomach contractions and symptoms. For example, when the blood glucose is abnormally high (hyperglycaemia), the rate at which the stomach empties food into the intestine is slower and symptoms, such as fullness, are greater. The rate of stomach emptying and the absorption of glucose from the intestine affect the rise in the blood glucose level after a meal; this is an important issue because it is desirable to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range to minimise the risk of both the development and progression of the complications of diabetes. In many people with diabetes eating a meal results in a substantial fall in blood pressure, which may cause fainting and falls. By slowing gastric emptying the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure is minimised. Our group has been the recipient of ongoing support from the NH and MRC for approximately 18 years to conduct research in this area. As a result we have performed the most comprehensive studies to date and developed new methods to evaluate stomach and intestinal function in people with diabetes, resulting in international recognition. The studies proposed in the current application represent a logical development from our previous work and have important implications for the management of diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Andr","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045516","middle_name":"Jpm","last_name":"Smout","source_individual_id":"RMIS1613007","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andr Smout"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88777","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030645","middle_name":"","last_name":"Feinle-Bisset","source_individual_id":"RMIS1585350","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Christine Feinle-Bisset"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84964","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002495","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Jones","source_individual_id":"5015532","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Karen Jones"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77345","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002272","middle_name":"","last_name":"Horowitz","source_individual_id":"5020423","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77291","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Melvi...","data":{"first_name":"Melvin","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0021921","middle_name":"","last_name":"Samsom","source_individual_id":"RMIS1613004","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Melvin Samsom"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82643","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4399","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The i...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Acupuncture","Health care evaluation","Randomised clinical trial","Women's health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250325,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Complementary medicine","Dysmenorrhoea","Women's health"],"scientific_title":"The influence of acupuncture on reducing women's pain from primary dysmenorrhoea: a randomised controlled trial","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250325","simplified_title":"How effective is acupuncture with reducing women's pain from primary dysmenorrhoea?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"310875","source_system":"Dysmenorrhoea refers to painful uterine cramps during menstruation. It is a common condition that affects as many as 50 percent of women. Severe menstrual pain can lead to an absence from work, or attending school, or interference with day to day lives. This condition is commonly treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the oral contraceptive pill. Studies suggest that between 30-50 percent of the adult population use some form of complementary medicine. Acupuncture, the insertion of fine needles, into specific areas of the body is increasingly being used to treat a number of conditions. It has been indicated in several non-clinical studies and two small clinical trials to be effective with treating dysmenorrhoea. Evidence from the Cochrane systematic review of acupuncture to treat primary dysmenorrhoea concluded acupuncture may be helpful. This study assesses whether women with dysmenorrhoea can be successfully treated using acupuncture. Women experiencing dysmenorrhoea with no underlying pelvic pathology will be offered the opportunity to take part in the trial. Women interested in taking part will be randomly allocated into one of two groups. One group of women will receive acupuncture, a second group will receive control (sham) acupuncture. The second study group involves the insertion of needles away from acupuncture points. Women will receive the treatment intervention for three menstrual cycles and then followed up for a further six months. Women will be asked to report on the pain they experience during menses and to report any time taken off from work or school, disruption with day to day activities, or the need for additional pain relief. In 2005 we expect to report on the effectiveness of this treatment on dysmenorrhoea and whether this treatment is acceptable to women. If the results are positive, it is hoped this will become an option available to women for the management of their dysmenorrhoea."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018491","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Crowther","source_individual_id":"RMIS4107","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81738","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Justin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035320","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Beilby","source_individual_id":"5013408","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Justin Beilby"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86154","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045485","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"5017594","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Caroline Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88765","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Oswal...","data":{"first_name":"Oswald","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0027328","middle_name":"","last_name":"Petrucco","source_individual_id":"RMIS216506","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Oswald Petrucco"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84060","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4398","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Magne...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2000,"keywords":["RANDOMISED TRIAL","MAGNESIUM SULPHATE","PERINATAL MORTALITY","CEREBRAL PALSY","INTRACEREBRAL BLEED"],"nhmrc_grant_id":960489,"application_year":1995,"start_year":1996,"scientific_title":"Magnesium sulphate for the prevention of mortality and cerebral palsy in preterm infants","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PAEDIATRICS AND REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/960489","simplified_title":"Magnesium sulphate for the prevention of mortality and cerebral palsy in preterm infants","sub_type":"Epidemiology","total_budget":"684987.95","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018491","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Crowther","source_individual_id":"RMIS4107","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81738","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/35","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Immun...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["gastrointestinal symptoms","neuroimmunology","visceral afferents","immune response","irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1042952,"application_year":2012,"health_keywords":["dyspepsia","sensory nerves","cytokines","pain mechanisms"],"scientific_title":"Immune activation in functional gastrointestinal disorders","start_year":2013,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology and Hepatology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Patrick Hughes","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1042952","simplified_title":"The role of the immune system in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Functional Dyspepsia","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"468216.22","source_system":"Up to 30% of Australians are estimated to suffer from Functional Gastrointestinal Diseases such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Functional Dyspepsia, but the cause of these chronic diseases is unknown.
