There are ~45 orphan hormone receptors encoded by distinct genes in humans, since all receptors are important in the treatment of human disease, the plethora of orphan receptors has been the catalyst for the development of a new paradigm, reverse endocrinology. Reverse endocrinology is the process whereby the orphan hormone receptor is used to search for a previously unknown hormone, and metabolic pathway. We are interested in the orphan hormone receptors, Rev-erbA and RVR, orphan members of the receptor superfamily. Rev-erb alpha expression is regulated by fibrates, widely used hypolipidemic drugs, and the circadian cycle. Rev-erbs mediate the regulation of lipid metabolism and peroxisomal beta oxidation. Furthermore, Rev-erbs are acutely induced during brain seizures, postulated to regulate cerebellar plasticity, and involved in growth control. In view of these critical regulatory roles, and the success of reverse endocrinology to date, we intend to complete the structural analysis of the Rev-erb and RVR as a tool to identify the hormone that binds this receptor. Hormone receptors recruit proteins called nuclear receptor cofactors, that function as regulators of gene expression. The cofactors regulate gene expression and development. Furthermore these cofactors, when misregulated result in the onset of disease and carcinogenesis, which underscores the need for achieving a high resolution view of their function in many tissues. Along these lines, we are interested in exmining the function of these cofactors in muscle. Understanding the molecular role of the NR cofactors during muscle differentiation will be a critical step toward elucidating the dysregulation-function of these proteins in muscle diseases, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and inflammatory myopathy that have cofactor deficiency."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026936","middle_name":"E.O","last_name":"Muscat","source_individual_id":"RMIS5658","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof George Muscat"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83974","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2302","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The r...","data":{"media_summary":"nuclear sclerosis of the lens","end_year":2003,"keywords":["TGFbeta superfamily members","developmental genetics","lens development","molecular biology","transgenesis and gene knockouts"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142977,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["aftercataract","cataracts","eye disease","lens development","nuclear sclerosis of the lens"],"scientific_title":"The role of Crim-1 in lens development and eye disease.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Ophthalmology and Vision Science","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Melissa Little","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142977","simplified_title":"The role of a novel gene in diseases of the lens","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"We have recently isolated a novel gene (Crim1) and shown it to be strongly expressed during eye development. Its protein structure indicates that it may act to regulate the activities of two growth factor families, the TGF superfamily and the insulin-IGFs. These growth factors effect the behaviour of many cell types that influence events in normal and pathological development. For example in the eye lens, TGF 1 can induce cataractous changes in epithelial cells and early differentiating fibres; however, TGF signalling appears to be required for events in late stages of fibre cell maturation. Cataract is the leading cause of blindness and arises when lens cell architecture is disrupted and-or proteins aggregate abnormally. In humans, following ocular trauma, eye surgery, or in association with other diseases, cataracts can develop. These cataracts feature the development of subcapsular fibrotic plaques which obscure vision. We have shown that lenses cultured in the presence of TGF can mimic production of these plaques suggesting that these cataracts result from inappropriate activation of TGF . TGF is expressed in the lens and is abundant in the ocular media that bathes the lens. Thus, it appears that complex regulation of TGF bioavailability is required; epithelial cells and young fibre cells need to be protected from its cataractogenic effects, whereas older fibres require TGF signalling for maturation and-or survival. The expression pattern of Crim1 in the lens is consistent with it having a key role in inhibiting TGF in the lens. Thus, we hypothesise that Crim1 plays important roles in the lens, possibly via the modulation of members of the TGF superfamily and insulin-IGFs. We predict that Crim1 acts to maintain the lens epithelial phenotype and facilitate events in early fibre differentiation. If so, this may have implications for devising molecular strategies for preventing or slowing diseases, such as the various forms of human cataract."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Melissa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038091","middle_name":"Helen","last_name":"Little","source_individual_id":"5012687","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Melissa Little"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86868","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Frank","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043889","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Lovicu","source_individual_id":"5016055","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Frank Lovicu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88374","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Johnston","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008972","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Mcavoy","source_individual_id":"RMIS3721859","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Johnston Mcavoy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79132","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2303","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role ...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["conformational change","cytokine signalling","growth hormone","receptor dimerization","structure-function"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142959,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Ageing","Cancer","Dwarfism","Obesity"],"scientific_title":"Role of Conformational Change in Activation of the Growth Hormone Receptor","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Michael WATERS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142959","simplified_title":"How Does the Growth Hormone Receptor Initiate Signalling ?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"242545.9","source_system":"Growth hormone is an important hormone therapeutic for treating dwarfism.

This project seeks to find out how growth hormone sends its signal into the target cell through its surface receptor. It is believed that the primary event in signalling is the ability of the hormone to bring two receptors together (receptor dimerization). However, it may be that the receptor already is dimerized, and the role of the hormone is to induce a specific change in shape of the receptor, which transfers the signal of hormone binding into the cell to initiate signalling to the genome. We have good evidence that a specific shape change is required for activation of an important signalling pathway by growth hormone, and the closely structurally related receptor for erythropoietin is already dimerized before hormone binds. We want to find out exactly how the shape change acts, and whether the receptor is predimerized. This information is vital for designing small orally active mimics of growth hormone which could be of great value as an anabolic supplement for the frail elderly."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022867","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Waters","source_individual_id":"RMIS47580","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Waters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82896","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2300","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role ...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Hormone signalling","growth hormone","nuclear receptor","nuclear trafficking","transcriptional activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142960,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Ageing","Cancer","Dwarfism"],"scientific_title":"Role of the Growth Hormone Binding Protein as a Transcriptional Activator","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael WATERS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142960","simplified_title":"Gene Activation by the Extracellular Part of the Growth Hormone Receptor","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"387226.72","source_system":"Growth hormone is an important hormone therapeutic for treating dwarfism.

This proposal examines a novel way that GH could work, that is by sending the extracellular part of its receptor (GHBP) to the nucleus, where it can directly activate gene readout. This would have the effect of augmenting the normal action of GH to regulate gene readout. We have exciting preliminary data which makes us think this may be a new mechanism for hormone activation of genes. The level of GHBP in the nucleus is regulated, and if a defect in export of the GHBP occurred, this would lead to accumulation of nuclear GHBP and stimulate cell proliferation. This may be important in cancer cell proliferation, since we find nuclear GHBP in cancers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022867","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Waters","source_individual_id":"RMIS47580","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Waters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82896","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2301","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Manip...","data":{"media_summary":"renal interstitial scarring","end_year":2003,"keywords":["angiotensin II","nitric oxide","progressive chronic renal failure","renal growth factors","tubulointerstitial scarring"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142956,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["chronic cyclosporin nephropathy","diabetic nephropathy","ischaemic nephrosclerosis","progressive chronic renal failure","renal interstitial scarring"],"scientific_title":"Manipulation of tubulointerstitial nitric oxide and cytokine","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nephrology and Urology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Johnson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142956","simplified_title":"Preventing chronic kidney failure by blocking multiple factors causing scarring","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"211527.54","source_system":"Chronic kidney disease affects 1 in 250 people. Unfortunately, effective treatments are not available and so 1500 Australians commence dialysis on an artifical kidney machine every year. The main determinant of chronic kidney failure is scarring and damage to kidney tubules, which in many cases progresses to end-stage kidney failure, even if the original cause of the kidney injury is removed. Kidney scarring and damage appears to be caused by both decreases in protective factors and increases in damaging factors (called cytokines). These different factors interact with each other such that attempts to treat kidney disease by blocking a single type of cytokine is ineffective because of compensation by other cytokines. This project looks at the role of a kidney protective factor called nitric oxide (NO) in preventing scarring in human kidney cells grown in tissue culture. In three different models of human kidney disease, we will specifically focus on how the protective effects of NO are influenced by, and in turn influnce the actions of other cytokines. Armed with the knowledge of how these agents interact with each other, trials will be undertaken to prevent scarring and damage to kidney cells using a combination of agents which will simultaneously increase NO levels and block one or more injurious cytokines. The success of such a combined approach will go a long way towards developing new and effective treatment strategies for people with chronic kidney disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Da...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0034467","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Vesey","source_individual_id":"RMIS387799","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr David Vesey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85922","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013969","middle_name":"Wayne","last_name":"Johnson","source_individual_id":"RMIS14680","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Johnson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80471","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Zoltan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042272","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Endre","source_individual_id":"RMIS30819","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Zoltan Endre"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87972","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Glenda","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042655","middle_name":"Carolyn","last_name":"Gobe","source_individual_id":"5012448","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Glenda Gobe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88060","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2298","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Somat...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["genomics","DNA sequencing","epigenetics","glioblastoma","somatic mutation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1042449,"application_year":2012,"start_year":2013,"scientific_title":"Somatic retrotransposition drives neoplastic mutagenesis in glioblastoma multiforme","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cancer Genetics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS","cia_name":"A/Pr Geoffrey Faulkner","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1042449","simplified_title":"Mobile DNA as a contributor to human brain cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"663464.3","source_system":"Retrotransposons are mobile genes that copy-and-paste themselves in our genome.

The discovery that a prostaglandin enzyme (PGHS-2) is a key factor in activity-related bone formation and normal bone turnover, as well as a pharmacological target for reducing inflammation, has considerable clinical significance. Specific inhibition of PGHS-2 by recent anti-inflammatory drugs avoids formation of gastric ulcers, but their influence on normal bone remodelling and fracture repair is not known and must be investigated. Many such inhibitors are in advanced clinical trials, but their effect on bone metabolism has not been published. This project is important because it employs novel experimental models to advance our knowledge of prostaglandin biology in skeletal adaptation, and elucidates important clinical consequences for specific inhibition of PGHS-2 in the skeleton. This project will investigate the regulation of prostaglandin production by PGHS enzymes following mechanical loading in vivo. It will use cell, molecular and histochemical techniques to determine if the genes that regulate the enzymes are influenced by mechanical stimuli, and if they are dependent on other molecules, associated with structural proteins (stress fibres) within the cell. It will investigate if inhibition of PGHS-2 by antiinflammatory drugs or stress-fibre inhibitors, depresses normal bone turnover and healing responses. The outcome of these experiments could indicate new approaches to stimulate bone formation, preserve bone mass, or minimise adverse skeletal effects of anti-inflammatory treatments related to orthopaedic or dental procedures."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007324","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Forwood","source_individual_id":"RMIS18701","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Forwood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78676","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Al...","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029837","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Cassady","source_individual_id":"RMIS24493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Alan Cassady"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84725","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2299","size":1}],"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/22","size":1}
