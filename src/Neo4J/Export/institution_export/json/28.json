Using various strategies, we have identified part of the apoptin molecule that confers efficient localisation in the nucleus of tumour cells, but not non-tumour cells. Our experimental program intends to define this tumour cell-specific targeting signal in detail, and determine the molecular basis of the differential subcellular localisation of apoptin in tumour compared to normal cells. This should contribute fundamental new information regarding the differences between cancer and normal cells. Additionally, we intend to optimise the targeting signal and perform initial experiments to test its efficacy in targeting anti-tumour drugs to the nucleus of tumour cells. Our long-term aim is to use the apoptin tumour cell-specific nuclear targeting signal as part of modular constructs to combat cancer efficiently, and above all, with minimal damage to normal cells and tissues."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61218","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A nov...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Biomechanics","Chronic heart failure","Renal function"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436617,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Chronic heart failure","Neurohormonal activation","Renal hypofusion"],"scientific_title":"A novel device to improve renal blood flow in cardiorenal syndrome","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Specifically we aim to build a prototype and test the device in a relevant animal model of CHF. Chronic heart failure is a major public health problem affecting >10% of the adult population over the age of 60 years. It is associated with high morbidity, mortality, frequent hospitalisation and major cost burden on the public health system. Weak heart muscle results in poor delivery of blood to the kidneys. Poor delivery to the kidneys activates circulating hormones which in turn further impair cardiac function by adverse effects on the heart. We have developed and patented a novel catheter based system for improvement of renal function via a purpose built device. Proof-of-concept studies have shown that the device should improve kidney blood flow in the setting of CHF. Given the huge public health problem of heart failure and the importance of the kidney in this setting, the commercial potential for a simple device that can be positioned via a catheter-based approach, permanently implanted is large. The device is currently being constructed by the Monash University Department of Engineering where expertise exists with regard to biomedical devices and materials engineering. A series of proof-of-concept studies will then be performed in sheep, as the vasculature of the sheep roughly approximates the dimensions of man. Sheep with CHF will have the device inserted percutaneously into the aorta. Measurements will be made of renal artery flow, relevant circulatory hormones and ultrasound of the heart at baseline (pre-deployment) and following deployment. We believe the above studies (should they be successful) will be sufficient to constitute definitive proof-of-concept and thus allow the device to be commercialised, most likely by a licensing arrangement with a device company."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031455","middle_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Hunyor","source_individual_id":"5015390","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Hunyor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85142","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Henry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037854","middle_name":"","last_name":"Krum","source_individual_id":"5011241","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Henry Krum"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86810","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042496","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Friend","source_individual_id":"RMIS4293952","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Friend"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88024","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61219","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Insul...","data":{"media_summary":"Polycystic Ovary syndrome","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Arterial function","Exercise training","Insulin resistance-signalling","Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","Reproduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606553,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["Cardiovascular disease prevention","Diabetes","Infertility","Insulin Resistance","Polycystic Ovary syndrome"],"scientific_title":"Insulin resistance in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and the role of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PAEDIATRICS AND REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE","cia_name":"Prof Helena Teede","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606553","simplified_title":"Insulin resistance and exercise in PCOS","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"416115.74","source_system":"11% of women have polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS), characterised by insulin resistance, irregular periods and infertility.

These skills are very important for success at school; for example, if children are unable to participate in school sports they often feel isolated and rejected from the peer group. Also, hand writing problems have a significant impact on children's academic performance. Our previous research has suggested that there may be particular patterns of motor problems that characterise individuals with autism and Asperger's disorder. Our proposed research aims to use the kinds of 3D motion analysis technology used in the movie industry to capture exactly how people affected by these conditions move and respond to the environment. This study will enable us to highlight particular parts of the brain-motor circuitry that are affected by these disorders and will also enable us to more clearly distinguish how autism is different from Asperger's disorder. Ultimately, it is hoped that our motor investigations will lead to improved assessment and interventions for these disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Nicole","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015881","middle_name":"Joan","last_name":"Rinehart","source_individual_id":"5017217","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Nicole Rinehart"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81004","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Je...","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003295","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Mcginley","source_individual_id":"5012354","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Jennifer Mcginley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77580","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010691","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Tonge","source_individual_id":"RMIS35666","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79601","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019803","middle_name":"","last_name":"Iansek","source_individual_id":"5015426","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Iansek"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82041","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041235","middle_name":"Lockyer","last_name":"Bradshaw","source_individual_id":"RMIS32791","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr John Bradshaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87692","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61216","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Are n...","data":{"media_summary":"vasodilatation","end_year":2012,"keywords":["cerebrovascular","nitric oxide","nitroxyl","oxidative stress","vascular function"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606556,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["antioxidants","hypertension","stroke","vascular disease","vasodilatation"],"scientific_title":"Are novel nitric oxide mimetics protective in vascular disease?","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Barbara Kemp-Harper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606556","simplified_title":"Protective mechanisms in vascular disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"634044.19","source_system":"Nitric oxide (NO) is a biologically active gas which controls blood flow and blood pressure.

By the age of 3, virtually every child has been infected by RSV at least once. RSV is also an important cause of pneumonia in the elderly and is estimated to cause more deaths each winter than influenza. In Australia, an estimated 100,000 infants are infected by RSV every year. In Victoria, RSV is the most common cause of all reported cases of respiratory tract disease, with an estimated annual cost of $1-4 million. Despite more than 40 years of research there is no vaccine to prevent RSV infection, and the only drug (ribavirin) licenced for treatment of RSV infection is expensive, difficult to administer, toxic, and of doubtful efficacy. We propose to examine one of the RSV proteins, the matrix protein (M). M is very important for virus propagation and is responsible for resultant cell injury. We have observed that M enters the cell nucleus (the location for all cellular DNA and RNA synthesis) where it appears to inhibit host cell RNA synthesis early in infection; later, it exits the nucleus in a step required for virus production in the cytoplasm. The signals that regulate transport of M into and out of the nucleus and the effect on the host cell leading to pathogenesis, are the focus of this proposal. The results of this study will be beneficial in many ways. Most importantly, we will gain knowledge about the processes underlying cell injury caused in RSV disease, which may lead to the identification of novel targets for intervention strategies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000227","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Bardin","source_individual_id":"5019436","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philip Bardin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76719","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61217","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mecha...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["adhesion mechanisms","experimental glomerulonephritis","inflammation","laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM)","leucocyte membrane molecules"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606564,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["chronic renal disease","glomerulonephritis","nephrology","renal failure"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of Glomerular Leukocyte Recruitment","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Michael Hickey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606564","simplified_title":"Glomerular leukocyte recruitment","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"586428.38","source_system":"The glomerulus is the filtering component of the kidney.

Hypertrophy is initiated by a population of immature muscle cells known as myoblasts which fuse to form myotubes, and then mature to form muscle fibers (differentiation). Many proteins involved in a cascade of activation and-or deactivation are important for regulating hypertrophy (hypertrophic signaling). Failure of skeletal muscle to induce hypertrophy can lead to muscle degeneration. The FHL proteins are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. FHL proteins are molecular scaffolds which direct assembly of protein complexes to form the muscle contraction machinery (sarcomere). We propose FHL proteins will initiate-regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Increased levels of FHL1 correlate with skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, it is unclear if increased FHL1 is alone sufficient to induce hypertrophy directly. We have genetically engineered mice to express elevated levels of FHL1 specifically in skeletal muscles (FHL1 transgenic mice) and these mice show muscle enlargement. FHL1 transgenic mice have larger muscle fibers and are >7-fold stronger than non-transgenic littermates. We are currently examining which cell signaling pathways are affected by elevated FHL1. We are also investigating the role of another family member FHL3 in the differentiation of immature myoblasts, a process essential for both embryonic and postnatal skeletal muscle (hypertrophy) development. In the cell nucleus, FHL2 regulates genes which control cell growth and death and increased nuclear levels of FHL2 been detected in prostate cancer biopsies. Recently we demonstrated that FHL2 binds and is sequestered from the nucleus, by a protein, filamin. We are investigating the FHL2-mediated regulation of genes in human melanoma cells, which due to gene mutation are devoid of filamin and will determine how this affects FHL2 function in muscle."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Edna","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007725","middle_name":"Christine","last_name":"Hardeman","source_individual_id":"5015078","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Edna Hardeman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78790","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61226","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"ISOLA...","data":{"media_summary":"stem cell therapy","end_year":2012,"keywords":["cardiac progenitor cells","cardiomyocyte","gene targeting","human embryonic stem cells"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606586,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["cardiac failure","cardiac hypertrophy","cardiology","myocardial disease","stem cell therapy"],"scientific_title":"ISOLATION, EXPANSION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HUMAN CARDIAC PROGENITOR CELLS.","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Upon stimulation, a series of signals are generated inside the cell which lead to cell division and development. One of the signaling pathways which responds to growth factor stimulation is the PI3-kinase pathway. This pathway has been implicated in many different human cancers which occur when cells divide uncontrollably and invade into the surrounding tissues. Following growth factor stimulation, PI3-kinase generates a molecule known as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which leads to the activation of many proteins in the signaling pathway. All cells which have PI3-kinase also have enzymes which act to switch off the signals generated by PI3-kinase and thus may play a role in preventing cancer and regulating cell development. We have identified a new enzyme known as PIPP and have shown that it acts to switch off the signals generated by PI3-kinase.

We have also identified a number of proteins which bind to PIPP and we will investigate the role these proteins play in regulating cell signaling.

These autoimmune diseases are incurable and controlled mainly by long-term administration of substances that suppress the immune system, often with serious side-effects. A rational approach is to render the rogue immune system harmless by removing the cells that recognize these particular molecules. This can be achieved by a Trojan horse approach in which the molecules are delivered to the immune system such that that the immune cells that recognize them are removed. To deliver these molecules to the immune system we will genetically engineer bone marrow stem cells, or embryonic stem cells that generate these stem cells, because they are precursors of mature immune cells. Rejection of organ transplants arise in a similar way and also require long-term immunosuppression. A similar approach can therefore be taken to promote acceptance of foreign organ grafts.

We have identified a new enzyme (72kDa 5-phosphatase) which resides inside the cell and regulates signals generated by an enzyme called PI3-kinase. Two of the PI3-kinase signals have been demonstrated to regulate the activity of an oncogene involved in breast and ovarian cancer. We aim to determine the specific role each of these PI3-kinase signals plays in the activation of the oncogene. In addition the levels of the 72kDa enzyme is altered in some cervical and lymphoma cancers. We will image live cells containing specific fluorescent probes under different conditions and study the activation and location of these probes in order to understand how different PI3-kinase signals are regulated in time and space. In addition to regulating signals that are involved in cancer, PI3-kinase controls signals that are important for proper immune function. Phagocytosis is a biological process where specialised immune cells (macrophages) take up and remove harmful particles such as bacteria or tumour cells from the circulation. This process depends on PI3-kinase and the signals it produces. We will determine whether the 72 kDa enzyme, which is expressed in macrophages, plays a role in regulating these signals during phagocytosis. We have shown that the 72 kDa enzyme can interact with several different proteins which may affect its location and activity within the cell. We will examine the effect of these interactions on the PI3-kinase signals which are involved in cell survival and immune responses. We will study the function of the enzyme in the intact animal by producing mice which lack this enzyme. Given the possible role of this enzyme in cancer, these mice will be examined for their susceptibility to develop tumours."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61225","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regul...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Diabetes","Insulin resistance","Protein tyrosine phosphatase","Reactive oxygen species","Signalling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606604,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["Cell signalling","Diabetes (type 2)","Insulin resistance"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of insulin sensitivity by reactive oxygen species","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Tony Tiganis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606604","simplified_title":"Regulation of insulin sensitivity by ROS","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"564644.09","source_system":"In morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes chronic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are detrimental and diminish insulin's ability to maintain normal blood glucose levels.

In the adult, CREATINE is obtained either from the diet (after absorption from the gut), or after synthesis in, and release from the liver. We do not know how fetal tissues obtain CREATINE, but we do know that when CREATINE is too low the fetus is likely to die, and that if extra CREATINE is supplied in the mother's diet the fetus is more likely to survive profound asphyxia at birth. In this project, in pregnant animals we will determine if fetal tissues can synthesize and take up CREATINE, and if providing extra CREATINE in the maternal diet throughout pregnancy can protect the heart, brain and breathing apparatus from the damaging effects of asphyxia or low oxygen (hypoxia).

The development of multiple resistance phenotypes has already led to compromises in the ability to successfully treat infected patients and to increased treatment costs. The emergence of these resistant bacteria is the result of excessive or inappropriate use of antibiotics and the ability of antibiotic resistance genes to be transferred from resistant to susceptible bacteria, either within or between bacterial species. The movement of resistance elements that are integrated into the bacterial genome often involves their excision from their existing site and their subsequent integration into another site in the same or a different genome. This project centres on the analysis of this process in resistant bacteria that cause major disease problems in our hospitals. The research project will focus on MRSA (Multiply Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) which has been a serious problem in our hospitals for many years, and Clostridium difficile, an emerging pathogen of increasing importance and which causes a very serious and chronic form of colitis in hospital patients. By studying the biochemical processes by which enzymes called recombinases excise and subsequently integrate antibiotic resistance elements from these bacteria and by determining the three dimensional structure of such enzymes we aim to determine the mechanism of action of members of this important enzyme family. The major outcomes of the project will be an increased understanding of one of the major processes by which antibiotic resistance determinants can spread both within and between bacterial pathogens of importance in the hospital environment. These studies will contribute towards the development of improved methods for controlling the spread of resistant pathogens and resistance genes in the hospital environment, with concomitant benefits to human health."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Julian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004318","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Rood","source_individual_id":"RMIS46068","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julian Rood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77872","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Dena","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038197","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lyras","source_individual_id":"5016113","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Dena Lyras"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86900","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034708","middle_name":"Charles James","last_name":"Wilce","source_individual_id":"RMIS182462","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Matthew Wilce"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85991","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61228","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Hypox...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["circulatory physiology of the kidney","mathematical modelling","oxygen consumption","stereology","tissue oxygenation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606601,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["ischemia-reperfusion injury","oxidative stress","polycystic kidney disease","renal failure"],"scientific_title":"Hypoxia is the common pathway to renal failure","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Roger Evans","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606601","simplified_title":"How does the diseased kidney get starved of oxygen?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"495362.65","source_system":"A lack of oxygen in the kidney (hypoxia) is a primary cause of kidney disease, but the mechanisms are not clear.

Despite significant improvements in the treatment of these pre-term babies there remains a high incidence of kidney failure. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron and they are formed in the kidney late in pregnancy at a time when many preterm babies are already delivered. Hence, it is important to determine what is the effect of preterm birth on the formation of nephrons. We have shown that the baboon is an excellent model of kidney development in humans. Like humans, we can prematurely deliver baboons and maintain them in a neonatal intensive care unit after birth. In this model, we have evidence to suggest that the formation of the the nephrons within the kidneys of the pre-term infants is impaired and we predict that this leads to impaired kidney function after birth and to susceptibility for renal disease in adulthood. In this study, we will examine kidney function in preterm baboon and human babies and also undertake studies in autopsied kidneys from baboon and human pre-term infants. We will determine whether the number and the cellular structure of the nephrons is affected by preterm delivery and if so, whether kidney function is affected. By comprehensively examining the medical records of the mother and babies, we also aim to identify factors in the care of the mother prior to birth, or of the baby after birth which may link to impaired nephron formation and kidney dysfunction in the baby. We will also determine whether administration of retinoic acid to the baboon preterm baby soon after birth can stimulate the formation of nephrons. The findings of this study will provide important new insights into the mechanisms of kidne failure in preterm babies and will identify potential strategies to prevent nephron loss and enhance nephron formation in preterm infants, which will in turn have long-term implications to kidney health."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Mildred","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004789","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Stahlman","source_individual_id":"RMIS4332561","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mildred Stahlman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77999","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000365","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Bertram","source_individual_id":"5011614","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Bertram"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76752","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ly...","data":{"first_name":"Lynette","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020960","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moore","source_individual_id":"RMIS4332558","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lynette Moore"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82369","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Mary","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006117","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Black","source_individual_id":"RMIS5854","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Mary Black"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Jacqueline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041677","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Coalson","source_individual_id":"RMIS4332555","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jacqueline Coalson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87813","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61229","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"ROLE ...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["Down Syndrome","cerebral ischaemia","cerebrovascular","inflammation","neuroprotection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606488,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["brain","cardiovascular disease","stroke"],"scientific_title":"ROLE OF A DOWN SYNDROME-RELATED PROTEIN IN STROKE OUTCOME","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606488","simplified_title":"PROTECTION IN STROKE BY A DOWN SYNDROME GENE","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"931302.45","source_system":"This project will test whether a gene called DSCR1, which is present at a higher level in Down Syndrome individuals, might play a protective role in the outcome after stroke.

The importance of OA has been acknowledged by its listing within musculoskeletal disease, the 7th health priority in Australia. It is 4 times as common in women as in men.Treatments which slow or prevent OA progressing are limited, so prevention must play a key role. With increasing disease severity, joint cartilage is lost. We have recently developed a method to measure joint cartilage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans which is able to assess the severity of structural changes in the knee. Using this method will allow us to assess 2 issues: 1) Obesity is the only identified modifiable risk factor for knee OA. However, the mechanism is poorly understood. Weight loss programs may be more effective at reducing the risk of OA if they are combined with programs aimed at maintaining muscle mass. 2) Bone is important in development of Knee OA, but its role is poorly understood. Understanding how bone metabolism relates to risk of knee OA may allow us to prevent disease. Bone is more likely to respond to pharmacological manipulation than cartilage. Thus it may prove a more effective target for intervention than cartilage. The Geelong Osteoporosis Study was begun in 1994 to study bone health in Australian women (urban and rural). Much information relevant to the risk of OA has been collected over the past decade. By performing MRI of the knee now and in 2 years time, we will determine the effect of different measures of obesity and bone metabolism on structural change at the knee which predisposes to OA. Since both of these factors (obesity and bone metabolism) are potentially modifiable, this study may offer new avenues of prevention and therapy in knee OA. This has the potential to promote a better quality of life as people age and to reduce the economic burden of knee OA in the community."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020177","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Kotowicz","source_individual_id":"RMIS256477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Mark Kotowicz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82152","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002156","middle_name":"Joy","last_name":"Henry","source_individual_id":"RMIS2282034","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Henry"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77262","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033078","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Pasco","source_individual_id":"RMIS586865","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julie Pasco"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85571","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Anita","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040530","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Wluka","source_individual_id":"RMIS706208","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Anita Wluka"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87501","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61234","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Treat...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["brain injury","fetal physiology","infection","inflammation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606479,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["brain injury","fetal response to infection","inflammation","intra-uterine infection"],"scientific_title":"Treatment of Cerebral Palsy - An Experimental Approach","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Suzanne Miller","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606479","simplified_title":"Protecting the fetal brain against infection","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"589544.75","source_system":"Cerebral palsy is characterised by disordered movement evident early in life leading to lifelong disability.

We have identified a family of genes called the Fras and Frem genes and some of these are mutated in a disorder called Fraser Syndrome. Fraser Syndrome patients have profound defects in the normal development of their skin and kidneys. We are studying the function of these genes with a view to understanding not just how Fraser Syndrome develops, but how our organs develop normally. The genes involved in FS contribute to the extracellular matrix which is effectively the scaffolding which our cells use when developing into our organs. The extracellular matrix is also important in maintaining our adult tissues and responding to damage. It can act as a physical support and as a key controller of how ours cells react to growth factors and to each other. This proposal will explore how the Fras and Frem genes mediate these interactions to control normal development and also to determine how their mutation gives rise to disease. In doing so we hope to gain insights into more common diseases which affect both the kidney and the skin."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0022213","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Smyth","source_individual_id":"5017633","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Ian Smyth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82732","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61233","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Resea...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["Bacterial pathogen","Helicobacter pylori","Host-pathogen interaction","Innate immunity","Mucosal inflammation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606476,"application_year":2009,"start_year":2010,"scientific_title":"Research Fellowships","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Microbiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Richard Ferrero","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606476","simplified_title":"Research Fellowships","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"591080.99","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007251","middle_name":"Louis","last_name":"Ferrero","source_individual_id":"5014611","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Richard Ferrero"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78657","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65024","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncou...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Bioinformatics","Protease","Protein Folding","Protein Structure","Serpin"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436656,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Ashley Buckle","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436656","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"559560.3","source_system":"I am a protein crystallographer determining the structures of medically important proteins such as proteases.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of nitrous oxide in such people.
