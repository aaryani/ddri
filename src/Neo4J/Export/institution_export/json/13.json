One of the major life threatening complications is acute graft versus host disease (AGVHD) in which the doner immune system damages the patient's skin, liver and gut, amongst other tissues. Dendritic cells initiate and direct immune responses. We have shown that dendritic cells are central to the initiation of AGVHD and have shown that a marker called CMRF-44 is expressed on activated dendritic cells before AGVHD emerges. We have developed potential new therapeutic antibodies that target activated dendritic cells and shown that they are effective in preclinical studies. This project will further validate these antibodies, then test their safety and their ability to prevent AGVHD in patients.

The development of better vaccines against TB is crucial to reducing disease and preventing transmission. We shall develop and test new TB vaccines composed of a protective TB protein and immune-stimulating molecules in dry powder which can be safely delivered to the lungs. This respirable vaccine will be used to protect against TB and boost the effects of BCG."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ni...","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028762","middle_name":"P","last_name":"West","source_individual_id":"5018276","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Nicholas West"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84448","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Warwick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041287","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Britton","source_individual_id":"5012794","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Warwick Britton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87705","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039008","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Payne","source_individual_id":"5019173","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Richard Payne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87106","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Hak-Kim","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018160","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chan","source_individual_id":"RMIS6859630","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Hak-Kim Chan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81647","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/73969","size":1}],"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/13","size":1}
