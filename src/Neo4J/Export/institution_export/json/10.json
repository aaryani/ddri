This disease is the most common form of intellectual disability that runs in families caused by an unusual form of change in a particular gene called FMR1, whereby a very short sequence of DNA in a gene expands by repeating itself to such an extent that once it reaches a certain size the whole gene stops working and the disease occurs. The expansion in the gene is not uniform across the generations, and only occurs when passed on from the mother to her offspring. However, many females carrying only a short sequence may pass on, for unknown reasons, either a large expanded sequence leading to disease, or one similar in size to her own. This complexity in the progression of the number of CGG repeats means that there is a relatively large number of mothers, ~1 in 300, who are quite normal but at risk of having an affected offspring. The factors that trigger this expansion in the DNA are presently not well understood, but a number of genetic markers in the FMR1 gene have been implicated. This study will assess the contribution of an array of these genetic markers in determining the risk of expansion of the short repeat from mother to offspring and hence the risk of fragile X. Conducting this study in Tasmania has two advantages. First, by having access to genealogical records that permit the linking of fragile X families we shall be able to identify common predisposing factors of fragile X more accurately. Second, by testing the whole population with intellectual disability in one State of manageable size we shall obtain an unbiased estimate of the prevalence of fragile X."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Rober...","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0015030","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"RMIS74225","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Robert Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80772","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1899","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equip...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Equipment Grant"],"nhmrc_grant_id":520917,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2008,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Ms Marian Obenchain","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/520917","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"74400","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Ma...","data":{"first_name":"Marian ","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0038833","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Obenchain","source_individual_id":"RMIS329345","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Marian  Obenchain"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87061","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62160","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Influ...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["chronic illness","self-management","social learning theory"],"nhmrc_grant_id":330455,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Influence of persuasion, modelling and mastery learning on self-management and self-efficacy of chronic illness","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Amanda-Jayne Weeks","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/330455","simplified_title":"Influence of persuasion, modelling and mastery learning on self-management and self-efficacy of chronic illness","sub_type":"Public Health Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"42068","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Amand...","data":{"first_name":"Amanda-Jayne","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0010983","middle_name":"","last_name":"Weeks","source_individual_id":"RMIS3388769","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Amanda-Jayne Weeks"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79693","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5952","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equip...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Equipment Grant"],"nhmrc_grant_id":219253,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"","cia_name":"Dr Barbara Murray","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219253","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"27594","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ba...","data":{"first_name":"Barbara","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015148","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Murray","source_individual_id":"RMIS3503","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Barbara Murray"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80806","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3823","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Pluri...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["Fertility","embryonic stem cells","germ cells","leukemia","transcriptional regulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606691,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["blood diseases","germ cell tumors","infertility therapy","kidney disease"],"scientific_title":"Pluripotent Stem Cells from the mouse testis","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Developmental Genetics (incl.

This study builds on our previous work in which we have found evidence of discrimination against people with hepatitis C in health care settings. Discrimination, inappropriate and unfair treatment against people with hepatitis C, in health care settings is a major barrier to care, treatment and support. A key strategy for developing effective strategies to reduce both perceived and real discrimination of people with hepatitis C in health care settings is to gain a better understanding of the range of issues experienced by the health care providers themselves and factors in the broader health service context that impact on optimal care. The aim of this study is to identify these factors and the findings will influence policy and practice with the ultimate goal of removing barriers to equitable and appropriate health care for people with hepatitis C. The study will focus on both people (health care providers)- the knowledge, attitudes and practices among health care professionals in relation to infection control practices, hepatitis C and injecting drug use; and contexts (health care settings)- factors in the health care settings that contribute to discriminatory, inappropriate or unfair treatment of people with hepatitis C. The study will focus specifically on health care settings of general practice, dentistry, nursing and pharmacists. The outcomes will be used to develop practical and effective strategies for both improving health care for HCV positive individuals and improving the working relationships and environments for these

These studies may identify a new molecular target for anti-invasive drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Sara","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018427","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Courtneidge","source_individual_id":"5014098","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Sara Courtneidge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81720","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025896","middle_name":"Henry","last_name":"Kaye","source_individual_id":"5012194","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Kaye"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83679","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Pe...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026351","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Lock","source_individual_id":"5016041","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Peter Lock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83815","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62715","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The q...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2001,"keywords":["MALARIA","ANTIMALARIALS","DRUG RESISTANCE","HAEM","DRUG ACTION"],"nhmrc_grant_id":990096,"application_year":1998,"start_year":1999,"scientific_title":"The quinoline antimalarials: Mechanisms of action and resistance in Plasmodium falciparum","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and clinical chemistry","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Leann Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/990096","simplified_title":"Understanding antimalarial drug action and parasite resistance","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"332114.84","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Leann","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040079","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS5525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leann Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87379","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/869","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Disse...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Bcl-2","Caspase","Nematode","Signal transduction","Yeast"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284513,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Autoimmune disease","Cancer","Degenerative disease"],"scientific_title":"Dissection of the mechanisms of action of evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway components","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Defects in apoptosis can contribute to cancer or autoimmune disease. Conversely, diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease have been linked to excessive cell death. To develop drugs that promote apoptosis when it fails to occur, or prevent inappropriate cell death, it is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling apoptosis. The first recognised component of the mammalian cell death machinery was Bcl-2; a protein associated with development of cancer. Despite much research since then, the way in which Bcl-2 and related proteins function is still unknown. This project capitalises on previous genetic and biochemical studies in a model genetic organism (the roundworm) to address this important issue. Animal cell death pathway components can be introduced into yeast such that activation of the introduced pathways leads to yeast death and its inhibition promotes yeast survival. We have used this approach to reconstitute the worm cell death pathway and a major mammalian apoptosis pathway in yeast. Yeast strains bearing these reconstituted pathways will be used to test functional equivalence of candidate mammalian proteins and their putative roundworm counterparts. The system will also be exploited to identify and characterise novel proteins that regulate cell death in mammals and worms. Understanding the way in which key molecules regulate apoptosis will assist in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents for many diseases in which cell death regulation is perturbed. This project capitalises on the evolutionary conservation of apoptosis to characterise the mechanisms of action of important mammalian apoptotic regulators and to seek novel mammalian apoptotic pathway components. Proteins identified in this way are likely to be important apoptotic regulators, as our approach ensures that their functions are evolutionarily conserved."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ch...","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042948","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hawkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS412152","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Christine Hawkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88127","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5170","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cellu...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Flavivirus replication","Lipid Modulation","Membrane/protein trafficking","Ultrastructural investigation","Virus infection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351460,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Flavivirus infection","Lipid modulation","Viral pathogenesis","Virus-host interactions"],"scientific_title":"Cellular microenvironments facilitating the replication and propagation of flaviviruses","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Jason Mackenzie","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351460","simplified_title":"What does flavivirus infection do to cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"505278.99","source_system":"Flaviviruses are the agents of many mosquito-transmitted infections and many deaths globally each year. The emerging virus West Nile virus (strain New York) is a member of this virus family and shares 99% amino acid homology with the endemic Australian virus Kunjin virus. During virus growth in cells, cellular membrane structures are induced or rearranged by these viruses for their own purpose. That being the production of more virus particles for reinfection of other cells. Using Kunjin virus as a model, and advanced techniques in biochemistry and electron microscopy, we have identified for the first time these membrane structures as the apparent sites of replication of the viral RNA or genetic material, and of the viral proteins involved. We have also observed how new virus particles are able to get out of infected cells and shown how some drugs can prevent this occurring thus limiting their transmission. This research will focus on how the membrane structures are formed in infected cells. The research will determine what cellular components are required by the virus to help it propagate. In particular specific cellular proteins and membrane components that are captured by the virus and moved to different sites in the infected cells. These apparent requirements could possibly lead us to a greater understanding of the complex interactions that occur between the invading virus and the host cells. We aim to directly visualize the process of infection within living cells using new and innovative microscopic techniques. Another of our objectives is to determine the effects of infection on normal cells. The question being whether flavivirus infection disrupts normalcell fuctions like secretion etc. An understanding of these processes, and how the viral RNA is copied into new RNA for more virus particles, will assist in the development of antiviral drugs for treatment of this pathogenic group of viruses."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043491","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Khromykh","source_individual_id":"RMIS12877","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alexander Khromykh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88276","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038214","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Mackenzie","source_individual_id":"RMIS56171","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jason Mackenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86904","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6375","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Myoep...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2016,"keywords":["breast cancer","invasion","protease inhibitors","mouse models","cell-cell communication"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1047748,"application_year":2012,"start_year":2013,"scientific_title":"Myoepithelial cell stefin A suppresses breast cancer invasion","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cancer Cell Biology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS","cia_name":"Dr Belinda Parker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1047748","simplified_title":"The role of natural protein inhibitors in blocking breast cancer invasion","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"437039.88","source_system":"The mechanisms required for breast cancer cells to spread outside of the ducts and into the surrounding breast tissue are largely unknown.

As drugs, such as chloroquine, become increasingly useless due to the development of parasite resistance, there is an urgent need to understand the mode of action of and the molecular basis of resistance to existing antimalarials and to design affordable treatments that can replace chloroquine. It is known that some compounds, that have only poor antimalarial activity themselves, can synergise the action of chloroquine. This may involve the inhibition of the activity of proteins that directly or indirectly extrude chloroquine from its site of action in the parasite's digestive apparatus. Unfortunately, thechloroquine synergisers examined to date have been too toxic to be useful in vivo. In preliminary studies we have identified some compounds that would be suitable for use in malaria patients, including a widely used antimalarial drug, primaquine, that can synergise the activity of chloroquine against chloroquine-resistant parasites. We will attempt to understand the molecular basis of this interaction. This will allow us to define optimal combinations of chloroquine and a resistance-reversing quinoline for use treating malaria.

Following diagnosis of MCI, active management through symptomatic drug treatment remains equivocal, therefore, memory impairment continues to be troublesome and patients and families are seeking interventions that offer improvement in quality of life. Cognitive interventions are low cost and, where effective, can provide a stand-alone intervention or add value to the pharmacological approach. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether an early intervention program of memory training is effective in improving use of memory strategies in everyday life, and whether this has psychological and emotional benefits for individuals with MCI and their families. We will evaluate through a randomised controlled trial the efficacy of a memory-group program which will involve the family and patient, rather than just the person with MCI, in developing increased awareness of memory issues and specific strategies to prevent memory failures. Over successive cohorts recruited from memory clinics, families will be randomly assigned to either an immediate intervention or a delayed intervention (waiting-list control) group. We will also recruit a sample of healthy older adults who will be similarly randomised into early and late intervention groups. Healthy older adults will provide a means of establishing whether any improvements in the MCI groups are (i) to the same extent as healthy older adults and (ii) to normative levels. Evaluation will be at pre- and post-intervention and at six months follow-up on tests of memory, questionnaires of knowledge and use of memory strategies in everyday life, and appraisal of level of wellbeing. Information about memory and systematic training in compensatory memory skills are expected to significantly improve the capacity of patients and families to cope with everyday memory difficulties. Through active participation in the management of memory impairment, it is expected that the level of wellbeing will increase, for both patient and families."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016036","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Saling","source_individual_id":"RMIS57346","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Saling"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81043","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Glynda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020126","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Kinsella","source_individual_id":"5015721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Glynda Kinsella"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82138","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Be...","data":{"first_name":"Ben","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038893","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ong","source_individual_id":"5016817","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Ben Ong"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87079","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035086","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Ames","source_individual_id":"5013190","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Ames"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86090","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Elsdon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016466","middle_name":"","last_name":"Storey","source_individual_id":"RMIS137151","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elsdon Storey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81172","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62384","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Impro...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["adolescents, youth","health and wellbeing survey research in multi-ethn","health promotion","psychosocial factors","refugee health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":487351,"application_year":2007,"start_year":2008,"scientific_title":"Improving the Validity of Health and Well-Being Measures for Refugee Adolescents Health Promotion Outcomes","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Ms Aude Plontz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/487351","simplified_title":"Improving the Measurement of Refugee Adolescents Health and Well-Being for Health Promotion Outcomes","sub_type":"Public Health Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"50173.73","source_system":"Measuring health and wellbeing in a culturally diverse refugee population presents many methodological challenges (e.g. language and cultural barriers).
