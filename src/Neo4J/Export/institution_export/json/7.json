These variable legal contexts guarantee international interest in this research. in addition this research team has extensive experience - dating back up to 20 years - in successfully researching even the most marginalised elements of the sex industry in Australia. By the conclusion of the project we will have assessed sex worker access to health promotion programs, including health services, in three states.

The disease is caused by the formation of large deposits of cholesterol in the walls of major blood vessels. This cholesterol comes from cholesterol-carrying particles in the blood which penetrate into the tissue of the blood vessel. They are taken up by the cells of the tissue which become engorged with large amounts of cholesterol and are called 'foam cells'. These foam cells also contain a small but signficant amount of damaged (oxidised) forms of cholesterol, called oxysterols. We have found than an oxysterol called 7-ketocholesterol makes it difficult for cells to get rid of excess cholesterol. Therefore this oxysterol may be part of the reason why foam cells develop. This project will study how 7-ketocholesterol blocks cholesterol removal from cells. This may lead to the development of drugs which remove or prevent 7-ketcholesterol accumulation in the blood vessel and so prevent or reverse atherosclerosis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Wendy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031579","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jessup","source_individual_id":"RMIS97823","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wendy Jessup"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85174","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2059","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Devel...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["actin cytoskeleton","cancer cell biology","drug development","apoptosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1004188,"application_year":2010,"health_keywords":["melanoma","drug efficacy","cancer chemotherapeutic agents"],"scientific_title":"Development of anti-tropomyosin drugs for the treatment of melanoma","start_year":2011,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cancer Cell Biology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS","cia_name":"Prof Peter Gunning","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1004188","simplified_title":"Development of novel anti-cancer drugs","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"578351.99","source_system":"Australia has the highest incidence of melanoma worldwide.

A blood cell is designed to move in a liquid medium whereas a muscle cell is optimised for physical movement of attached bones. We are studying the mechanisms which control cell shape. We focus on the components of the cell skeleton (cytoskeleton) which are implicated in the regulation of shape. In particular, we study the actin based microfilament system. We have previously shown that two types of these components of the cytoskeleton are able to control the structure of cells. In addition, we have found that variants of these two components (called isoforms) are used to build structures in different parts of cells. This has led us to think about the anatomy of cells and tissues in a new way. In some ways its like building a city. You create different kinds of buildings to suit their purpose. Each building uses a combination of building blocks which suit the structural demands of rooms and the overall building. In this study we are proposing to identify the specific job that one of these types of building blocks must play in order to allow normal cell growth and embryo development. To do this, we plan to change these genes in mice and then examine the impact on cell and tissue anatomy. This promises to contribute to the conversion of anatomical science and pathology from descriptive to experimental-mechanistic disciplines. This in turn will lead to a new tool set of diagnostic agents for the pathologist and the development of drugs which target specific functions of the cytoskeleton."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ga...","data":{"first_name":"Galina","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021972","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schevzov","source_individual_id":"5017385","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Galina Schevzov"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013397","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Gunning","source_individual_id":"5015010","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Gunning"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80321","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6460","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Intra...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["atherosclerosis","lipoprotein","lysosome","macrophages","oxidation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":119250,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","coronary heart disease","stroke"],"scientific_title":"Intracellular cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides and hydroxides- their metabolism and their modulation of cell function","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

A key component in the formation of atherosclerotic narrowings is the accumulation of fat-filled cells called foam cell macrophages in artery walls. Our study investigates the nature of the fats that macrophages accumulate, and how mild modification of these fats changes the metabolism of the macrophage. Cholesterol circulates in the blood stream as specialised particles called lipoproteins. The lipoprotein containing most of the cholesterol is low density lipoprotein (LDL), so-called bad cholesterol. LDL is the main source of fat that accumulates in the artery wall in atherosclerosis. When in the artery wall, it is taken up by macrophages which develop a foamy appearance. The accumulation of LDL fats within macrophages is greatly enhanced by the prior modification of LDL. The most well known of these modifications is oxidation- a chemical process of fat spoilage as occurs with rancid butter. Mild oxidation of LDL is well known to occur in human atherosclerosis. However, the ability of macrophages to accumulate the products of mild oxidation has never been established. We have recently discovered that the lipid products of mild oxidation of LDL can build up in macrophages. We achieved this by developing a new system of feeding oxidised LDL to macrophages. Surprisingly, not only could these lipid oxidation products be internalised by the cells, but they progressively accumulated over time, and caused major disturbances in the ability of macrophages to clear ordinary fats inside the cell. This means that mild oxidation of LDL can cause secondary damage inside the macrophage, which is far greater than had previously been realised. This project investigates precisely how the oxidised LDL is metabolised by macrophages and how it disturbs other cell functions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Leonard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008461","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kritharides","source_individual_id":"RMIS1108085","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leonard Kritharides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78986","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2062","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"","data":{"media_summary":"screening","end_year":2019,"keywords":["sexually-transmitted infections (STI)","epidemiology","prevention","human papillomavirus (HPV)","chlamydia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1071269,"application_year":2013,"health_keywords":["gonorrhoea","antimicrobial resistance","Aboriginal health","mathematical modelling","screening"],"scientific_title":"","start_year":2015,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof John Kaldor","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1071269","simplified_title":"New interventions to control sexually transmitted infections and their consequences","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"10353045","source_system":"Sexually transmitted infections are important causes of illness and death in Australia and globally.
