cancer is the third most prevalent cancer in the Western World and result in the yearly death of several thousand people in Australia alone. We have discovered a specifice gene mutation of a receptor molecule called gp130 that results in the formation of stomach cancer in mice. We are now aiming to understand the exact molecular events by which this mutation results in the uncontrolled growth of stomach mining cells. Our proposal combines the expertise of the two investigators in signal transduction and the making of genetically modified mouse models. These strategies will be employed to specifically address in the laboratory mouse the function of two specififc signaling cascades, called Stat3 and TGF-beta. The identification of detailed description by which these molecules causally relate to cancer formation will provide clear and specific molecular targets for future therapies to treat various cancers, including those of the stomach."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ho...","data":{"first_name":"Hong-Jian","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005673","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zhu","source_individual_id":"5018579","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Hong-Jian Zhu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78249","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5954","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Recom...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2001,"keywords":["IMMUNOTHERAPY-CANCER"],"nhmrc_grant_id":8139,"application_year":1999,"start_year":2000,"scientific_title":"Recombinant bispecific antibodies for immunotherapy of renal cell carcinoma","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Marion Harris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/8139","simplified_title":"Recombinant bispecific antibodies for immunotherapy of renal cell carcinoma","sub_type":"Medical Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"52752","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ma...","data":{"first_name":"Marion","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042913","middle_name":"Therese","last_name":"Harris","source_individual_id":"5039522","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Marion Harris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88121","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1650","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncou...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Gastrointestinal cancer","Molecular genetics","Signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":331004,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/331004","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"595500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5953","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Devel...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2017,"keywords":["lung cancer","prognostic markers","predictive","methylation","gene expression"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1074035,"application_year":2013,"health_keywords":["genetics"],"scientific_title":"Development of prognostic and predictive biomarkers to aid treatment of lung cancer","start_year":2014,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Chemotherapy","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS","cia_name":"Dr Thomas John","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1074035","simplified_title":"Lung Cancer Biomarker Development","sub_type":"Health Professional Research ECF","total_budget":"184719.12","source_system":"Although a number of new therapies are emerging in the treatment of lung cancer, chemotherapy remains the backbone of treatment for most patients.

It is the second most common cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer, behind lung cancer. In fact, approximately 10% of all new reported cancer cases world-wide are stomach cancer. The risk of stomach cancer increases with age, with risk rising progressively and peaking at about 60 years of age. Men are affected twice as often as women Like all cancers, stomach cancer results from the progressive acquisition of mutations in genes that normally ensure a balance between cell growth and cell death. Mutations which predispose individuals to stomach cancer accumulate in the epithelial cells that provide the lining to the stomach. The progression of stomach cancer proceeds through a number of distinct anatomical stages which can be easily recognised by pathologists. Mutations in a number of genes (known as Kirsten-ras, p53) are commonly found in stomach tumours. Moreover, some of the mutations are highly associated with distinct stages of tumour development. As yet, however, we have no real insights into how these mutations cooperate with each other to produce full-blown (malignant) stomach cancer. In our proposal, we are aiming to establish stomach cancer in mice. Our approach will be to use an existing animal model which is predisposed to stomach cancer. We will progressively introduce mutant genes into stomach epithelial cells and study how they cooperate with each other to produce benign, and ultimately, malignant tumours in the stomach of mice. This will help us to understand which mutant genes are required for each stage in tumour development and may provide more rational approaches to stomac cancer screening and treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Brendan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008163","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Jenkins","source_individual_id":"5015495","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Brendan Jenkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78905","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013246","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Giraud","source_individual_id":"RMIS53506","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Giraud"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80278","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4180","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Disse...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["B cell tolerance","Lyn tyrosine kinase","Mouse models of autoimmunity","Signal transduction","Signaling pathways in autoimmunity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":234704,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Autoantibodies and autoantigens","Autoimmune disease","Autoimmune glomerulonephritis","Systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome"],"scientific_title":"Dissecting the role of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in B cell differentiation and the development of autoimmunity.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/234704","simplified_title":"The role of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in autoimmunity.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"487500","source_system":"The immune system has to be capable of responding to an unlimited array of pathogens, but at the same time remain unresponsive to, or tolerant of self-antigens. A breakdown in the tolerance to self-antigens results in autoimmunity. Autoimmune diseases include more than 70 chronic disorders that affect about 1 in 20 people in the Western population. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie autoimmune disease is essential for the design of more effective treatments. The Lyn tyrosine kinase is a member of a family of genes that participate in transmitting information across the cell membrane. This enzyme is expressed in blood cells, and is involved in mechanisms pertaining to infection, immunity and allergic responses. To further our understanding of the role of this enzyme in the context of the whole animal, we have generated two strains of mice, one that is unable to make Lyn (Lyn-deficient mice) and one that expresses an activated form of the Lyn enzyme (Lyn-up mice). We have found that both strains of mice develop autoimmune disease with characteristics similar to the human autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These studies suggest that Lyn is an important severity gene in autoimmunity. In this study we will examine in detail the role that Lyn plays in B cell development, function and autoimmunity, and we intend to identify the pathways that lead to autoimmune disease in Lyn mutant mice. On completion of these studies we will have developed a catalogue of the molecules and pathways perturbed in Lyn mutant mice. These studies will greatly improve our knowledge and understanding of the mechamisms behind certain autoimmune diseases, and may indeed lead to improved diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of patients with these conditions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Kenne...","data":{"first_name":"Kenneth","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0013502","middle_name":"","last_name":"Harder","source_individual_id":"RMIS1693984","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Kenneth Harder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80349","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019597","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hibbs","source_individual_id":"5015236","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81986","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022451","middle_name":"Mathew","last_name":"Tarlinton","source_individual_id":"5017824","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Tarlinton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82786","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4181","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Is Ly...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Asthma susceptibility genes","Lyn tyrosine kinase","Mouse models of asthma","Severe, persistent asthma","Signaling pathways in asthma"],"nhmrc_grant_id":234705,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Asthma and allergy disease susceptibility","Chronic Inflammatory lung diseases","Respiratory diseases"],"scientific_title":"Is Lyn tyrosine kinase a predictor of severe, persistent multi-trait asthma and allergy?","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/234705","simplified_title":"The role of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in asthma and allergy.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"250250","source_system":"Asthma is a major health problem in Australia affecting over 10% of the population at any time, and more than 25% of the population at one stage in their lives. Although the public perception is that asthma treatments have improved management of the disease, more than 700 people die from severe asthma each year and hospitalisation from exacerbation (sudden worsening) is one of the most costly components of the health care burden in Australia and most developed countries. Currently there are no molecular markers that can predict who will get severe asthma and there are no specific treatments to reverse severe exacerbations. This project will use advanced molecular biology methods to examine whether a molecule called Lyn may be important. The Lyn tyrosine kinase is a member of a family of genes that participate in transmitting information across the cell membrane. This enzyme is expressed in blood cells, and is involved in mechanisms pertaining to infection, immunity and allergic responses. To further our understanding of the role of this enzyme in the context of the whole animal, we have generated mice that are unable to make Lyn protein (Lyn-deficient mice). In animal models of asthma we know that if Lyn is not functioning, severe and persistent asthma develops. We have also made preliminary studies that suggest that Lyn does not work properly in people who have been admitted to the emergency ward with life threatenting asthma. In this study we will examine in detail the role that Lyn plays in asthma and allergy, and we intend to identify the pathways that give rise to asthma in Lyn-deficient mice. We will also investigate our hypothesis that Lyn activity may be reduced or disregulated in patients with asthma and allergy. This research should lead to better predictive markers for severe asthma and also to improved and specific treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Gary","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005805","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Anderson","source_individual_id":"RMIS168037","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gary Anderson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78284","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019597","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hibbs","source_individual_id":"5015236","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81986","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Robyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009441","middle_name":"E","last_name":"O'Hehir","source_individual_id":"RMIS997049","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robyn O'Hehir"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79262","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4182","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Targe...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["biomarkers","targeted therapy","cancer research","drug sensitivity","mutation screening"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1056170,"application_year":2012,"start_year":2013,"scientific_title":"Targeting mTOR in gastrointestinal cancer","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cancer Cell Biology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS","cia_name":"Dr Yvonne Yeung","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1056170","simplified_title":"Novel inhibition of cancer cell growth in gastrointestinal cancer","sub_type":"Medical/Dental Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"69499.84","source_system":"This research project will focus on new treatment targets for gastrointestinal malignancies, focusing on the mTOR pathway which is important in driving cancer cell growth.

Their favourable attributes include their reproductive biology, the optical clarity of embryos, and the accessibility of embryos for experimental procedures. Previous studies overseas have recovered over 1500 strains of zebrafish with inherited diseases due to induced mutations in about 500 genes. Many of these zebrafish have abnormalities of unexpected precision and are leading to new genes with novel specialized functions. About 50 mutant zebrafish strains exist in which red blood cell development is perturbed - this was easily recognized because the transparency of embryos enabled lack of blood be easily seen. Our new studies aim primarily to recover mutant zebrafish with disorders of white blood cell formation. We have identified methods to recognize failure of white blood cell formation in zebrafish, and will employ these methods to look for inherited disorders that specifically affect white blood cell development in a process called genetic screening. Fish with different sets of randomly mutated genes will be systematically screened to identify those with abnormal white blood cell development. We have tested our approach and identified several mutants affecting white blood cell development. Once these new strains of fish are identified, we will find the genetic lesion responsible for the abnormality in several of the most interesting strains by gene mapping and positional cloning. Hence, the mutant zebrafish identified in the screen will eventually lead to the discovery of new genes important in white blood cell growth and development. The fish themselves will provide insights into the causes of congenital diseases of white blood cells. Since many genes involved in early development are also important in cancer, we believe that newly identified genes will also help understand the causes of abnormal growth of white blood cells in leukaemia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038045","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Lieschke","source_individual_id":"5015985","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Graham Lieschke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86855","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ju...","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031991","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Layton","source_individual_id":"RMIS85280","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Judith Layton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85273","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4184","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"equip...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"nhmrc_grant_id":580018,"application_year":2007,"start_year":2008,"scientific_title":"equipment grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Ms Caroline Cody","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/580018","simplified_title":"equipment grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"90949","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Ca...","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0035937","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Cody","source_individual_id":"RMIS4723566","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Caroline Cody"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86316","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/63458","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Thera...","data":{"media_summary":"radiotherapy of cancer","end_year":2003,"keywords":["DNA repair","EGF/EGFR signalling","animal model","proteomics","tumour immunotherapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":234709,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["disease model, cancer","epithelial neoplasms, malignant","growth factors / receptors","proteomics","radiotherapy of cancer"],"scientific_title":"Therapeutic Strategies in Epithelial Cancer Through Signalling Inhibition of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew Scott","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/234709","simplified_title":"Cancer Therapy by Inhibition of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"136250","source_system":"The growth of cancer cells is regulated by many factors, including the presence of growth receptors on the surface of cancer cells. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is present in some normal tissues, but is highly expressed on many common cancers, including brain, breast, lung, head and neck, colon and prostate cancer. We are developing a number of potential therapeutic compounds that act by inhibiting the EGFR in cancer cells. These compounds include a novel monoclonal antibody that binds to EGFR and inhibits its function, and a small molecule that binds to a portion of the EGFR inside cancer cells and also inhibits function. Both of these compounds prevent tumour growth in laboratory studies. This project will examine the mechanisms of action of these compounds, and explore ways to improve their anti-cancer effect.

The proposal will dissect the relationship between memory T cell formation and the amount-length of antigen exposure; and the influence on memory induction from various immune modulators (cytokines) at the time of antigen encounter. Using a range of sophisticated detection methods, very early memory T cells will be identified in the primary response and tracked through their differentiation into long-term memory pool. Experiments will determine how T cells against particular determinants are selected from the primary immune response, retained in the memory pool and recalled in the subsequent challenges. The properties of antigen processing of various determinants will be correlated with the immunodominance hierarchy in the primary and memory response.

These molecules can control the number, location and function of specific blood vessels within the body. Recently we have discoverd new members of a family of growth fcators called vascular endothelial growth factors, and demonstrated their ability to promote the growth of blood and lymphatic vessels. In this study we set out to examine the role of another family of growth factor receptors, called RYK (for which we have a granted patent in the USA and Australia) in angiogenesis. functional experiments in mice have demonstrated that RYK can associated with a family of receptors called Eph receptors which play a key role in the remodelling of blood vessels during development and injury. Studying these molecules may tell us why blood vessels know' to be in the correct locations in the body and why in certain disease we see vessels of incorrect structure or location. These studies will form a basis of knowledge to develop rational means to manipulate blood vessel formation in the body, using non-surgical methods.

Conservative estimates (Australian Crohn's and Colitis Association) suggest that at least 23,000 Australians are affected (>1 in 1000). Ten years after onset, there is an estimated risk of 0.5-1.0% per year of pancolitis patients developing full-blown bowel cancer. Current therapies for colon cancer are not very effective and the median survival for patients with metastatic disease is poor at 7-12 months. It is therefore important to increase our understanding of the biology underlying these inflammatory conditions so that more effective treatments may be developed and fewer patients proceed to the cancerous stage. We have recently demonstrated a novel interaction between two proteins that may be relevant to intestinal inflammation. Surprisingly, the two proteins would not normally be expected to coincide with each other because of their different localisations within cells and tissues. The first protein, Cdx2, is only synthesised by intestinal lining cells and normally resides in the nucleus where it activates genes that play a role in the highly specialised absorptive functions of the intestine. The other protein, acrogranin-granulin, is more widely distributed in the body and is generally transported out of cells shortly after it has been made. It has been shown to interact with receptors on epithelial cells and blood cells and promotes their growth. In this proposal we will be investigating whether the complex formed between Cdx2 and granulin is important for normal physiology. Moreover since elevated levels of granulin are associated with inflammation, we aim to determine whether the Cdx2-granulin complex is formed during the active phase of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the Cdx2-granulin complex plays an important role in repairing the damage caused to the lining of the intestine during inflammation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Joan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025417","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Heath","source_individual_id":"5015167","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joan Heath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83543","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2870","size":1}],"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/20","size":1}
