It is characterised by painful joint destruction leading to work disability, diminished quality of life and decreased life expectancy. The usual treatment of arthritis leads to less inflammation however it cannot be relied upon to control bone and joint destruction. Patients often have long term worsening of joint function despite short and medium term improvement in joint pain and swelling. One reason for this paradox may be that while research has mainly focused on inflammation, far less is known about the processes responsible for bone damage. Normally, specialised bone cells called osteoclasts carry out bone breakdown during growth and maintenance of the skeleton. In rheumatoid arthritis, these cells are responsible for the joint damage; this proposal, therefore, focuses on inhibiting the activity of these cells as a new therapy. So far, our work using a model of human rheumatoid arthritis has demonstrated that it is possible to separate joint inflammation from joint damage by selectively targeting osteoclasts with an inhibitor known as Osteoprotegerin. Besides Osteoprotegerin, we have identified two novel molecules named OCIL and sFRP-1 and shown that they are present in the joints of animals and humans with arthritis. Very recent experiments in our laboratory show that in the test tube, OCIL and sFRP-1 (like Osteoprotegerin) block osteoclast activity. The sFRP-1 molecule may also block a very important messenger molecule in arthritis called tumour necrosis factor. We therefore propose to study the effect of OCIL and sFRP-1 in the joints of mice with arthritis. We expect that these new inhibitors will have favorable effects on joint damage. If so, they could undergo further testing for use in humans. We believe that investigations along these lines may provide a rationale for an entirely new treatment approach to improve the long term outcome for patients with arthritis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Evange","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027668","middle_name":"","last_name":"Romas","source_individual_id":"5017252","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Evange Romas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84141","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Natalie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010287","middle_name":"Ann","last_name":"Sims","source_individual_id":"5017543","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Natalie Sims"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79496","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4371","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The p...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2000,"keywords":["T CELLS","DETERMINANTS","LOCAL IMMUNITY","VACCINES","SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES"],"nhmrc_grant_id":960184,"application_year":1995,"start_year":1996,"scientific_title":"The potential of influenza vaccines designed to stimulate crossreactive T-cell immunity","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Microbiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Lorena Brown","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/960184","simplified_title":"Increasing the performance of influenza vaccines by stimulating T cell responses","sub_type":"Standard Project with Research Fellowship","total_budget":"592802.43","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Lorena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029635","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS41665","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Lorena Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84675","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/32","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Overc...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["cancer therapy","melanoma","receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)","drug resistance","targeted therapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1042980,"application_year":2012,"health_keywords":["combination therapy","kinase inhibitors"],"scientific_title":"Overcoming Receptor Tyrosine Kinase mediated resistance to BRAF Inhibitors in metastatic melanoma, colorectal and lung cancers.","start_year":2013,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cancer Therapy (excl.

Hedgehog proteins also stimulate the growth of adult stem cells that are responsible for the maintenance of many adult tissues such as the skin, bone and hair. Excessive hedgehog signalling however can lead to cancers, particularly of the brain and skin. The ability of hedgehog proteins to stimulate the growth of stem cells raises their use for expansion of stem cells.

In Western societies heart failure is primarily the consequence of a previous myocardial infarction. We have recently identified certain cells in the bone marrow of adult humans that can cause new blood vessel development in the heart after infarction, protecting the heart muscle cells against death and preventing heart failure. Since the cardiovascular diseases that are most likely to benefit from treatments utilizing adult bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitors, or angioblasts, predominantly affect aging individuals, critical questions that must be addressed are whether advanced age and-or progression of cardiovascular disease reduce the total numbers and-or the functional activity of such cells. In the current proposal we will investigate the relationship between increasing age or progression of ischemic heart disease and changes in the number and in vivo biologic properties of human angioblasts. Patients at various ages and stage of cardiovascular disease will be studied. Angioblast numbers will be quantitated in freshly obtained bone marrow cells. The ability of purified angioblasts to be targeted to the ischemic heart will be studied by labeling the angioblasts with a radioactive tracer and measuring tracer uptake in the heart at various time points after intravenous infusion of the cells. Finally, angioblast functional capacity will be evaluated using standard measurements of heart function before and at various time points after reinfusion of cells into the donor. In Aims 2 and 3 of this proposal we will focus our investigations on the potential use of angioblast therapy for reversal of established chronic heart failure in our animal models. Specifically, we will investigate whether induction of neovascularization results in cardiomyocyte regeneration and explore novel strategies to augment heart muscle regeneration by increasing angioblast trafficking to the damaged myocardium ."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Henry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037854","middle_name":"","last_name":"Krum","source_individual_id":"5011241","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Henry Krum"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86810","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Silviu","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002381","middle_name":"","last_name":"Itescu","source_individual_id":"RMIS2432373","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Silviu Itescu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77317","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4365","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A nov...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Bacterial pathogen","Bacterial virulence factors","Host-pathogen interaction","Legionella"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436607,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Community aquired infection","Legionnaire's disease","Pneumonia"],"scientific_title":"A novel CD39-like ecto-NTPDase of Legionella pneumophila","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Elizabeth Hartland","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436607","simplified_title":"How the Legionella bacterium causes disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"362046.73","source_system":"Legionnaire's disease is a serious cause of community acquired pneumonia.

The problem is compounded by the lack of safe and effective treament for fungal infections. Many pathogenic fungi are capable of growing in two very different forms.

In the latter case, NGF treatment can lead to death, rather than rescue, of neurons. In the last three years we have developed novel antisense oligonucleotides which can be used to switch off each receptor separately. These have been, and will continue to be, particularly valuable tools for our research. We have also uncovered a novel way in which the two receptors interact (via a signal transduction molecule known as SHC), which provides us with a competitive edge in this area. We have the expertise and equipment to identify and clone the missing factors that account for the paradoxical interactions between p75 and TrkA.

The latter is important in physiological processes such as genetic exchange during meiosis, but also in the response of the cell to DNA damage, specifically, breakages in both strands of the DNA helix.

Successful synthesis of proteins requires a large number of efficient ribosomes, the protein synthesis machinery. mTOR is a central cellular signalling molecule that directly regulates growth via modulating the efficiency of the ribosomes. It does this by regulating an enzyme called S6 kinase. Interestingly for long term or sustained increases in the rates of growth an increase in the number of ribosomes in addition to an increase efficiency of protein synthesis is required. This proposal will test the hypothesis that the mTOR-S6 kinase signalling pathway regulates protein synthesis both at the level of ribosome efficiency and capacity. This will be extended to determine the mechanism by which such regulation occurs. Furthermore recent studies have demonstrated that S6 kinase is involved in tumor growth. We propose that S6 kinase will contribute to the regulation of both normal or tumor growth at least in part via modulation of the number of ribosomes. Accordingly, S6K is upregulated in a segregated proportion of breast tumors. Outcomes from this project have the potential to provide targets to which specific therapies for particular breast tumors can be developed. Overall this information will also extend our basic knowledge on normal growth regulation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013491","middle_name":"Duncan","last_name":"Hannan","source_individual_id":"5015053","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ross Hannan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80344","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015512","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Pearson","source_individual_id":"5016929","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Richard Pearson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80914","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4471","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Epide...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["hereditary haemochromatosis","molecular epidemiology","risk factors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251668,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["epidemiology","genetic susceptibility","iron overload","risk factors"],"scientific_title":"Epidemiology of Hereditary Haemochromatosis","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Dorota Gertig","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251668","simplified_title":"What environmental risk factors modify hereditary haemochromatosis?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"868795","source_system":"One of the current challenges in public health is to translate the progress from the Human Genome Project into reduced morbidity and mortality from disease. Once genetic defects are characterised, knowledge about the variability in severity of disease in mutation carriers, is important from a public health perspective. Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disorder of iron overload that results in a wide spectrum of disease, varying from non-specific symptoms to severe damage to liver, heart, pancreas and joints from iron deposition. It is easily treatable by regular blood donation, and population-based screening for HH has therefore been advocated. In this study we aim to address gaps in the existing data on HH regarding dietary and lifestyle factors that contribute to the variable clinical picture of HH. The study will be based on the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, a cohort of 31,500 men and women who have been followed for approximately 10 years. Information on dietary and lifestyle factors was collected at initial enrollment, along with a blood specimen. We will test all non-Southern European participants (31,176) for the common HH mutations in the HFE gene and then select a subgroup of 1150 people, including all people with the main genetic defect as well as a comparison group, for further clinical followup. Participants will have genetic counselling and informed consent will be obtained. Participants will complete a short questionnaire and give a blood sample for measurement of iron overload, liver function, and other relevant blood tests, then undergo a brief clinical examination. Results of all tests will be given at a followup visit by genetic counsellor or physician. This study will provide important data on natural history of HH risk factors that influence variability in clinical presentation and the association of HFE mutations with chronic diseases and all cause mortality."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Martin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024486","middle_name":"","last_name":"Delatycki","source_individual_id":"RMIS1004328","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Martin Delatycki"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83288","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021252","middle_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Olynyk","source_individual_id":"RMIS126729","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Olynyk"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82452","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr De...","data":{"first_name":"Desiree","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012811","middle_name":"","last_name":"Du Sart","source_individual_id":"RMIS4510830","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Desiree Du Sart"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80167","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Katrina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000074","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Allen","source_individual_id":"5011777","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Katrina Allen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76666","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Dorota","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042606","middle_name":"Maria","last_name":"Gertig","source_individual_id":"RMIS501892","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Dorota Gertig"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88047","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ji...","data":{"first_name":"Jisheng","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006809","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cui","source_individual_id":"RMIS1002307","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Jisheng Cui"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78548","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4464","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Enhan...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["inhibitor design","ischemic preconditioning","protein structure"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251679,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cardiac protection","ischemia","ischemic preconditioning"],"scientific_title":"Enhancing the cardioprotective effect of diadenosine tetraphosphate: designing inhibitors against Ap4A hydrolase","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Paul Gooley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251679","simplified_title":"Designing inhibitors against diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"442500","source_system":"Ischemia describes the condition where blood flow in the blood vessels of the heart is decreased or blocked, preventing delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon where short bursts of ischemia, followed by reperfusion, actually protect the heart from a subsequent longer period of ischemia. The biochemical signalling events involved in preconditioning are complex and incompletely defined, but most likely involve multiple pathways, although the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channel may be in common with most pathways. Pretreatment with the compound diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) mimics ischemic preconditioning with noticeable reductions in tissue necrosis (cell death). This treatment has been shown in experimental work to protect the heart during periods of stress such as in heart surgery or recovery from an ischemic event. The biological site of action by Ap4A may be the mitochondria ATP-dependent potassium channel or an associated protein. Ap4A can be degraded by enzymes located inside and on the outside of heart cells, notably by two forms of Ap4A hydrolase. We will use antibody assays to understand the specific localization and amount of Ap4A hydrolase before and after ischemia and after ischemic preconditioning in human heart muscle and blood vessels. We propose to determine the structure of the enzyme and use novel computer methods to screen databases for potential inhibitors. These inhibitors of Ap4A hydrolase activity could aid the design of a potent inhibitor that would prevent Ap4A hydrolase from degrading Ap4A and therefore enhance the cardioprotective properties of Ap4A as well as minimizing side effects from the break down of Ap4A. We will also use these inhibitors and other known non-degradable Ap4A analogues in bioassays to test the relative significance of Ap4A hydrolase present in different cellular locations."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042686","middle_name":"Raymond","last_name":"Gooley","source_individual_id":"RMIS225256","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Paul Gooley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88069","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Sa...","data":{"first_name":"Salvatore","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039040","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pepe","source_individual_id":"RMIS68921","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Salvatore Pepe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87115","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004708","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"5011668","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Brian Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77980","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ja...","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010534","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Swarbrick","source_individual_id":"RMIS1739036","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr James Swarbrick"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79561","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Kenwyn","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013189","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Gayler","source_individual_id":"RMIS1739033","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Kenwyn Gayler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80260","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4465","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Prima...","data":{"media_summary":"primary health care","end_year":2007,"keywords":["ageing","falls","general practice","osteoporosis","vitamin D"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251682,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["aged care","bone fractures","osteoporosis","prevention of fragility","primary health care"],"scientific_title":"Primary care prevention of falls and fractures in the elderly by annual vitamin D supplementation","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Geoffrey Nicholson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251682","simplified_title":"Once yearly vitamin D treatment of elderly women by general practitioners to prevent falls and fractures","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"305750","source_system":"While Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer, many of us are not receiving enough sun exposure to adequately maintain necessary blood levels of vitamin D. For years it was assumed that vitamin D deficiency was rarely seen in Australia where sunlight abounds for most of the year. Although few foods are high in vitamin D, it was thought that only certain cultural groups where women are always veiled in public, very dark-skinned people and the housebound elderly, were at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Lower vitamin D levels following wintertime have now been reported in many populations including those living near the Mediterranean and in Geelong, Victoria. Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with an increased risk of falling through increased body sway and muscle weakness. Low levels of the vitamin also encourage the removal of calcium from bones and will predispose to bone fracture for two reasons - increased likelihood of falling and increased bone fragility and osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures are amongst the most important causes of ill-health among elderly people, causing an estimated 65,000 fractures in 2000-01. If nothing is done, fracture rates are estimated to increase from one every 8.1 minutes in 2001, to one every 3.7 minutes in 2021. Falls among the elderly are also a major health with about a third of people over 70years falling at least once every year. Almost 90% of all hip fractures result from the impact of a fall. This project will trial an annual dose of vitamin D to the elderly at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, falls and fractures. Fifteen hundred women will be supplemented with either vitamin D or a placebo dummy pill at the beginning of winter for five years. The supplementation will take place through their local doctor and researchers will expect to see fewer falls and bone fractures occurring in those receiving vitamin D than in the group receiving the placebo."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020177","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Kotowicz","source_individual_id":"RMIS256477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Mark Kotowicz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82152","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Kerrie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021927","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Sanders","source_individual_id":"RMIS6033188","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Kerrie Sanders"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82646","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033078","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Pasco","source_individual_id":"RMIS586865","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julie Pasco"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85571","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Doris","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005618","middle_name":"","last_name":"Young","source_individual_id":"5012587","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Doris Young"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78231","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Geoffrey","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009373","middle_name":"Charles","last_name":"Nicholson","source_individual_id":"RMIS3177995","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Geoffrey Nicholson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79246","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4466","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role ...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["foetal development","lymphatics","lymphocyte migration","sheep","thymus"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251683,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["HAART/AIDS","bone marrow transplantation","neonatal immunology"],"scientific_title":"Role of the thymus in T cell homeostasis during foetal and postnatal life in sheep","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ross Cahill","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251683","simplified_title":"Role of the thymus in T cell homeostasis during foetal and postnatal life in sheep","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"264750","source_system":"The mature T cell pool can arise from only two sources, either thymic export or expansion of the peripheral T cell pool or a mixture of both. The lifespan of either cell type, i.e. recent thymic emigrants or mature T cells, has considerable implications for the development of a pool of T cells able to respond to a large number of infections. Recent thymic emigrants represent a wide diversity of positively selected thymocytes exhibiting newly arising T cell specificities, but mature T cell pool expansion results in reduced diversity because of a predominant expansion of a limited number of clones. It follows that a mixing of the pool of older mature T cells with new ones just released from the thymus will introduce more variability, and hence greater adaptability into the immune system. We have developed techniques for labeling the thymus in vivo and the entire blood leukocyte pool in vivo using the long-term lymphocyte tracking dye CFSE. We can establish a cohort of labeled cells and we can, for the first time in any experimental system, track directly the survival, death or division of recent thymic emigrants and mature cells and their progeny together with their tissue homing properties and surface markers for periods of many months.

The disease has a large economic burden and is a major public health problem. Three bacterial species have recently been shown to be closely associated with advanced periodontal disease in humans. One of these three bacterial species has been shown to produce periodontal disease in a mouse model of disease and the major proteins on the cell surface of this bacterium have been characterized. Further, in this mouse model it has been demonstrated that killed cells of the bacterium or the major surface proteins when used as a vaccine prevent development of disease. The purpose of the current proposal is to extend this work to include all three bacterial species that have been associated with disease in humans. The major surface proteins of all these bacterial species when grown together as high density polymicrobial complexes will be determined. Recent results have shown that in high-density, polymicrobial cultures bacteria communicate using signalling systems which can alter the expression of cell surface proteins associated with disease. The ability of the three bacterial species, when grown in polymicrobial culture, to cause periodontal disease in the mouse model will be determined. This will allow the determination of whether a single species and-or multispecies vaccine is capable of protecting against disease in this model. The significance of the work is that it will increase our understanding of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease and it may lead to the development of an effective vaccine to help prevent disease in humans."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029989","middle_name":"Gerald","last_name":"Clement","source_individual_id":"5013988","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Clement"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84769","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Neil","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038745","middle_name":"M","last_name":"O'Brien-Simpson","source_individual_id":"5016756","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Neil O'Brien-Simpson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87033","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Eric","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009882","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Reynolds","source_individual_id":"RMIS106269","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Eric Reynolds"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79382","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Gert ...","data":{"first_name":"Gert","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0039982","middle_name":"","last_name":"Talbo","source_individual_id":"RMIS138936","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Gert Talbo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87360","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018555","middle_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"Dashper","source_individual_id":"RMIS4317167","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stuart Dashper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81751","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4476","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Genom...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["embryo development","epigenetics","germ cell"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251719,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cancer biology","fetal development","germ cell tumours"],"scientific_title":"Genomic imprinting in the germ line","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Dr Jeffrey Mann","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251719","simplified_title":"Imprinting in germ cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"152625","source_system":"This is a study of the biological system of epigenetics. Every cell in our body has the same genetics, or library of information contained in the form of DNA sequence. Epigenetics is the system that controls how this DNA is used in a particular situation, or what books are opened and read. During embryonic development, cells know what they want to become, e.g., a muscle cell, and, once they take on an identity, remember that they are when they duplicate themselves during growth. Epigenetics does not achieve this through changing genetics the library always stays intact. Rather, it acts by using proteins or chemicals to make DNA functional in one way, or another. Genomic imprinting is a special type of epigenetics. While an embryo has received identical genetic information from each of its parents, the epigenetic information received from each parent was not entirely the same. Some genes which behave differently according to what parent they came from. For example, a gene that makes a growth factor protein is active only if received from the father. If received from the mother, it is inactive, and makes no protein. Genes behaving in this way are known as imprinted genes. We are trying to discover what epigenetic mechanisms are behind this behaviour of imprinted genes. One way we are approaching this problem is to study germ cells the cells giving rise to eggs and sperm. These cells are unusual in that their imprinted genes behave in the same way regardless of whether they were received from the mother or father, i.e., like any other gene. If we can understand why this is the case, we will be better able to understand why imprinted genes behave the way they do in the rest of the cells of the body. Broadly, the mechanisms we uncover should further our understanding of germ cell development, gene expression, and disease. Perturbations in the epigenetic profile are likely causes of human disease, including cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr ...","data":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032314","middle_name":"Raymond","last_name":"Mann","source_individual_id":"5016187","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Jeffrey Mann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85365","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4477","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The e...","data":{"media_summary":"Social environment","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Early intervention","Family risk factors","Health Promotion","Parent management strategies","Prevention"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251721,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Adolescent behaviour","Child development","Family therapy","Parnet-child relations","Social environment"],"scientific_title":"The effectiveness of a school-based parent education program in the promotion of adolescent health: a randomised trial","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Family Care","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof John Toumbourou","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251721","simplified_title":"The effectiveness of a school-based parent education program in the promotion of adolescent health","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"422900","source_system":"Youth mental health and behaviour problems such as depression, suicidal behaviour, tobacco use, alcohol abuse and illicit drug use are currently priority issues within Australian national and state public health policies.

Until recent years the development of programs to support families through the transition into adolescence has been neglected. This is remiss, as there is evidence that a range of youth mental health and behaviour problems may be preventable through interventions through this transition. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-level, family intervention designed to promote adolescent health within secondary schools. The intervention will be implemented over the first two years of high school and incorporates both universal components (for all families) and selected components (for families with particular difficulties). The intervention elements have been developed and partially evaluated in work undertaken by the applicant and collaborators over the past five years. To evaluate this intervention a representative sample of 12 Victorian secondary schools will be randomly assigned to intervention and compared to 12 control schools with prior matching on school demographics and student behaviour variables. Intervention processes will be closely monitored and evaluated for impacts on relevant risk and protective factors. Effectiveness will be evaluated by testing whether reductions in youth mental health and behaviour problems were greater for intervention families compared to controls. The evaluation has been designed to test the theory that improvement across the whole secondary school environment can be encouraged by preventing the negative peer influences that can emerge within families experiencing adolescent adjustment problems"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034332","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Toumbourou","source_individual_id":"5019318","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Toumbourou"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85885","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4478","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effic...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["cognitive behaviour","command hallucinations (new keyword)","effectivness study","schizophrenia","therapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251730,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["command hallucinations","psychiatry and forensic psychiatry","psychological treatment","schizophrenia"],"scientific_title":"Efficacy of treatment for resistant command hallucinations.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Copolov","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251730","simplified_title":"How effective is therapy aimed at helping people resist voices that tell them what to do?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"343875","source_system":"Auditory hallucinations (AHs), often described as voices, are a common symptom of schizophrenia and psychoses. Command hallucinations (CHs) are a type of AH in which the voice heard by the patient commands him or her to perform a particular action. The nature of the directive may vary from inconsequential actions to commands to harm the patient or others. There is widespread public concern about the danger individuals with schizophrenia or related disorders pose to themselves and to the community. There is firm evidence pointing to the important role that CHs play in propelling psychotic individuals into serious and damaging actions. We have found, however, that most individuals who comply with dangerous CHs do so, not because they are angry, violent, antisocial or wish to cause harm, but because they feel powerless to resist. Though CHs are one of the most disturbing symptoms of psychosis, standard treatment has proved to be of limited benefit. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Treatment of Resistant Command Hallucinations (TORCH), an innovative treatment for CHs. TORCH is an extension of an existing treatment for psychosis that we previously developed. TORCH aims to reduce the distress, worry and harmful or self-defeating behaviour associated with CHs by arming the patient with effective strategies that will enhance resistance and reduce compliance. The project has clear implications for improved clinical and therapeutic management of CHs with major public health, clinical and forensic repercussions. The consequences of being formally assessed as being at risk of acting violently result in the potential for substantial restrictions on the freedom of the individual. The availability of TORCH may prompt a less restrictive management of individuals at risk of dangerous behaviour and promote a more optimistic attitude amongst clinicians. Relatives and carers also stand to benefit through reduction in perplexing and fear-inducing behaviours."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Paul ...","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0015119","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mullen","source_individual_id":"RMIS4316070","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Paul Mullen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80797","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006454","middle_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Castle","source_individual_id":"5012093","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Castle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78454","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jo...","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012964","middle_name":"","last_name":"Farhall","source_individual_id":"RMIS1763802","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr John Farhall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80210","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001025","middle_name":"","last_name":"Copolov","source_individual_id":"RMIS56671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Copolov"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76943","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020552","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Mackinnon","source_individual_id":"5011964","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Mackinnon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82252","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4479","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Can s...","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["acute rheumatic fever","aetiology","bacteriological surveillance","beta haemolytic streptococcus","molecular epidemiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":251690,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["acute rheumatic fever","pharyngitis","pyoderma","rheumatic heart disease"],"scientific_title":"Can skin infection with group A streptococcus cause acute rheumatic fever?","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Jonathan CARAPETIS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/251690","simplified_title":"Can skin infection with group A streptococcus cause acute rheumatic fever?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"459450","source_system":"It is traditionally taught that the cause of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is always infection of the throat with the bacterium group A streptococcus (GAS). However, in Aboriginal communities of the Top End of the Northern Territory the incidence of ARF is the highest reported in the world, yet GAS is uncommonly isolated from the throat. There is further information to suggest that GAS skin sores may underlie many cases of ARF. If this were proven, it would completely alter the traditional view of the cause of ARF, and have important implications for prevention of ARF around the world. Presently, these approaches focus on diagnosing and treating sore throat, but no country has proven that such a program can be successful in substantially reducing new cases of ARF. If it was known that skin infection could lead to ARF, then countries (including Australia) could emphasise the importance of skin health programs. A further benefit of this knowledge would be to influence GAS vaccine development, which presently is largely focused on the prevention of sore throat. A different possibility has recently been raised - that the cause of ARF may not always be GAS, but instead that the related bacteria GCS and GGS may have the potential to cause this disease. Proof of this hypothesis would even more dramatically alter our understanding of disease causation, prevention, and vaccine development. We propose to determine the cause of ARF in Aboriginal communities by regularly swabbing families of people with a history of ARF, and using genetic fingerprinting of the bacteria from the skin and throat swabs. When cases of ARF occur, we will be able to determine the site and type of infection that precipitated the attack. We will conduct a related study in more communities, in which we will swab family members of people with ARF and of control families (without ARF) to determine the bacteria most commonly isolated from ARF families."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035720","middle_name":"Rhys","last_name":"Carapetis","source_individual_id":"RMIS427188","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jonathan Carapetis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86254","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof ...","data":{"first_name":"Bart","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018509","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Currie","source_individual_id":"RMIS5835","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bart Currie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81742","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4472","size":1}],"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}
