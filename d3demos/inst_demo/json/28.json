Understanding CPT1c function in the brain will help us understand the causes of obesity and diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Sarah Lockie","data":{"first_name":"Sarah","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032170","middle_name":"Kathleen Haas","last_name":"Lockie","source_individual_id":"5045543","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Sarah Lockie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85322","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/75914","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Host-virus protein complexes in the immune system response to influenza","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2017,"keywords":["ubiquitination","structural biology","enzymology","immunity","X-ray crystallography"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1072267,"application_year":2013,"start_year":2014,"scientific_title":"Host-virus protein complexes in the immune system response to influenza","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Structural Biology (incl.

Our goal is to use these stem cells as treatment for human liver disease"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Rebecca Lim","data":{"first_name":"Rebecca","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038057","middle_name":"Seok Wai","last_name":"Lim","source_individual_id":"5040658","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Rebecca Lim"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86859","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Kumar Visvanathan","data":{"first_name":"Kumar","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0034487","middle_name":"","last_name":"Visvanathan","source_individual_id":"5012729","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Kumar Visvanathan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85932","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof George Yeoh","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023151","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Yeoh","source_individual_id":"RMIS145853","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof George Yeoh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82964","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof William Sievert","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016219","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sievert","source_individual_id":"5019263","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof William Sievert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81091","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/75504","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Circadian mechanisms for sex differences in shift work tolerance","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2016,"keywords":["sleep","women's health","shiftwork","sleepiness","circadian rhythms"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1064231,"application_year":2013,"health_keywords":["safety","light sensitivity"],"scientific_title":"Circadian mechanisms for sex differences in shift work tolerance","start_year":2014,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Sean Cain","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1064231","simplified_title":"Sex difference in shift work tolerance","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"552982.56","source_system":"It is well-established that women respond more poorly than men to shift work schedules, having more health complaints, more drowsiness and more accidents at work than men.

This project is to understand how t-PA promotes these unwanted effects in the brain and to devise novel approaches to extend the time window of t-PA administration in these patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Arnan Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Arnan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015020","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5011226","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Arnan Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80769","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Medcalf","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014929","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Medcalf","source_individual_id":"5016415","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Medcalf"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80745","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74101","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Proteases and protease-inhibitor complexes as modulators of traumatic brain injury severity","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["traumatic brain injury (TBI)","serpin","plasminogen","brain trauma","inflammation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1045755,"application_year":2012,"start_year":2013,"scientific_title":"Proteases and protease-inhibitor complexes as modulators of traumatic brain injury severity","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Robert Medcalf","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1045755","simplified_title":"How enzymes and enzyme inhibitors effect the brain after traumatic brain injury","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"609633.34","source_system":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in Australia, affecting approximately 21,800 Australians annually.

Building on our prehospital clinical trials expertise, we will conduct a trial to assess its effect on 6-month death and disability."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Reade","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039263","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Reade","source_individual_id":"5019204","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Reade"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87175","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ian Jacobs","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037497","middle_name":"George","last_name":"Jacobs","source_individual_id":"5018939","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ian Jacobs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86714","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Russell Gruen","data":{"first_name":"Russell","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037006","middle_name":"Lindsay","last_name":"Gruen","source_individual_id":"5012510","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Russell Gruen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86580","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Huyen Tran","data":{"first_name":"Huyen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0034340","middle_name":"Anh","last_name":"Tran","source_individual_id":"5034751","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Huyen Tran"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85891","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Bernard","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017703","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Bernard","source_individual_id":"5013458","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Bernard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81523","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Medcalf","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014929","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Medcalf","source_individual_id":"5016415","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Medcalf"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80745","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Biswadev Mitra","data":{"first_name":"Biswadev","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009167","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mitra","source_individual_id":"5020757","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Biswadev Mitra"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79190","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/74014","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Optimising the therapeutic efficacy of protein-based drugs against lymph-resident diseases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["lymphatic absorption","pharmacokinetics","drug delivery","protein trafficking","lymphatic disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1044802,"application_year":2012,"health_keywords":["cancer metastasis","therapeutics","modelling"],"scientific_title":"Optimising the therapeutic efficacy of protein-based drugs against lymph-resident diseases","start_year":2013,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmaceutical Sciences","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Lisa Kaminskas","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1044802","simplified_title":"Optimising the therapeutic efficacy of protein-based drugs against lymph-resident diseases","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"346151.96","source_system":"Effective treatments for lymphatic diseases (such as HIV and lymph-metastatic cancers) are limited by the lack of drug assess towards the lymphatic sites of disease progression.

Here we propose a novel mechanism that operates to control continual telomere renewal in ES cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philippe Collas","data":{"first_name":"Philippe","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030039","middle_name":"","last_name":"Collas","source_individual_id":"5040980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philippe Collas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84786","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lee Wong","data":{"first_name":"Lee","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005511","middle_name":"Hwa","last_name":"Wong","source_individual_id":"5018466","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Lee Wong"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78201","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/73138","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification of critical factors for the establishment and maintenance of the epidermal barrier","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["epidermal barrier","squamous cell carcinoma","transcriptional regulation","wound healing","epidermis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1031854,"application_year":2011,"start_year":2012,"scientific_title":"Identification of critical factors for the establishment and maintenance of the epidermal barrier","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Stephen Jane","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1031854","simplified_title":"Formation and maintenance of the barrier function of the skin","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"671424.52","source_system":"The human skin plays a crucial role in the body�s defence against our hostile environment.

In the follow-up group, responders complete a more extensive questionnaire and come to our laboratory for clinical assessments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Abramson","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040727","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Abramson","source_individual_id":"5011978","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Abramson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87560","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Geza Benke","data":{"first_name":"Geza","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029408","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Benke","source_individual_id":"RMIS679633","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Geza Benke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84627","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shyamali Dharmage","data":{"first_name":"Shyamali","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018676","middle_name":"Chandrika","last_name":"Dharmage","source_individual_id":"5011791","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Shyamali Dharmage"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81783","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bruce Thompson","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016639","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Thompson","source_individual_id":"5017907","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Bruce Thompson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81221","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/66461","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of IRAP inhibitors action on memory","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["memory","glucose","learning","trafficking","cognitive deficit"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1007907,"application_year":2010,"health_keywords":["mild cognitive impairment","dementia","memory disorders"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of IRAP inhibitors action on memory","start_year":2011,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Siew Yeen Chai","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1007907","simplified_title":"IRAP, glucose and memory","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"517897.37","source_system":"IRAP inhibitors are currently being developed as a new class of drugs for treating dementia and other forms of memory deficits.

A better understanding of the Grb7 protein will help to establish its potential as a novel drug target."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jacqueline Wilce","data":{"first_name":"Jacqueline","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040447","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Wilce","source_individual_id":"5018313","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Jacqueline Wilce"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87483","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr John Price","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021551","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Price","source_individual_id":"RMIS220951","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr John Price"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82541","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Myriam Gorospe","data":{"first_name":"Myriam","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001863","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gorospe","source_individual_id":"5024754","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Myriam Gorospe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77175","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/66222","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mediterranean diet and mortality:  Analysis of longitudinal dietary patterns using newly developed statistical methods","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["diet","biostatistics","longitudinal cohort study","methodology","measurement"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1004233,"application_year":2010,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","dietary intervention","mortality"],"scientific_title":"Mediterranean diet and mortality:  Analysis of longitudinal dietary patterns using newly developed statistical methods","start_year":2011,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew Forbes","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1004233","simplified_title":"Patterns of change in Mediterranean diet and subsequent mortality","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"340547.84","source_system":"Assessment of the effect of changes in diet of health has not undergone rigourous analytical assessment in the scientific literature.

This molecular pathway may explain how diet affect immune responses."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Di Yu","data":{"first_name":"Di","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040651","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yu","source_individual_id":"5018548","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Di Yu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87536","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Tatyana Chtanova","data":{"first_name":"Tatyana","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024117","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chtanova","source_individual_id":"5013946","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Tatyana Chtanova"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83191","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Charles Mackay","data":{"first_name":"Charles","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008810","middle_name":"Reay","last_name":"Mackay","source_individual_id":"RMIS570004","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Charles Mackay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79085","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65101","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Australia Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["Allergy","Autoimmunity","Chemokines","Immune regulation","Inflammation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606947,"application_year":2009,"start_year":2010,"scientific_title":"Australia Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Charles Mackay","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606947","simplified_title":"Australia Fellowship","sub_type":"Australia Fellowship","total_budget":"4000000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Charles Mackay","data":{"first_name":"Charles","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008810","middle_name":"Reay","last_name":"Mackay","source_individual_id":"RMIS570004","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Charles Mackay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79085","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65100","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Ventilation heterogeneity and airway remodelling in asthma","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["Airway obstruction","Asthma","Lung function","Magnetic resonance imaging"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606944,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["Airway hyperresponsiveness","Airway remodelling","Asthma and respiratory diseases","Early detection and intervention"],"scientific_title":"Ventilation heterogeneity and airway remodelling in asthma","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE AND HAEMOTOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Francis Thien","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606944","simplified_title":"Consequences of uneven ventilation and stiff airways in asthma","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"522586.36","source_system":"Asthma is a common and important as a cause of significant symptoms and even death.

The results will relate strongly to future drug and vaccine development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Reena Ghildyal","data":{"first_name":"Reena","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042613","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ghildyal","source_individual_id":"5014826","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Reena Ghildyal"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88050","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Jans","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Bardin","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000227","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Bardin","source_individual_id":"5019436","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philip Bardin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76719","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65010","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of ILK in Hedgehog signaling and medulloblastoma.","data":{"media_summary":"paediatric brain tumours","end_year":2012,"keywords":["anti-cancer drugs","cancer","murine models","oncogenesis","signalling pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":606404,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["cancer biology","cell growth and differentiation","drug development","inhibition of cancer cell growth","paediatric brain tumours"],"scientific_title":"The role of ILK in Hedgehog signaling and medulloblastoma.","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cancer Cell Biology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"ONCOLOGY AND CARCINOGENESIS","cia_name":"A/Pr Gregory Hannigan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606404","simplified_title":"The role of ILK in Hedgehog signaling and medulloblastoma.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"452248.84","source_system":"Molecular signaling pathways regulate normal embryo development, and deregulated signaling by these pathways causes many cancers.

Recent estimates suggest that Type 2 diabetes and heart disease cost the Australian community almost $9 billion in direct costs per annum. People with chronic conditions follow medical and behavioural prescriptions variably, however, while also using complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies, practitioners, vitamins and herbs. We will explore the reasons for presentation to and use of CAM practitioners and therapies by people diagnosed with and under treatment for two of the most commonly diagnosed chronic conditions - cardiovascular disease and diabetes - in order to establish the relationship with adherence to their prescribed treatment. The focus is on what is described as the �drivers, costs and benefits� of the use of CAM, and how the practical interaction of CAM and conventional health care approaches may support adherence. This research program will have very important implications for the control of these diseases and individual wellbeing. Using an innovative interdisciplinary approach and a mix of research methods, the research will provide a unique evidencebase on community approaches to and use of complementary and alternative medicine, and the significance of this to current and future health needs. The program will take advantage of the interdisciplinary skills in novel ways to explore areas of health and society that have so far received limited attention.

There is a recent evidence based clinical practice guideline to inform the diagnosis and management of people with dementia and the support of their carers. Many of the recommendations from this guideline are relevant to Australian general practitioners. Strategies to implement guidelines into practice are needed in all areas of health care, but changing clinical practice is complex and a body of research developing methods of identifying barriers to specific practice changes is emerging. This project aims to support GPs in improving the general practice based care of people with dementia, and so improve their quality of life. In addition we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge about how to bring about practice change and implement a clinical practice guideline. We plan to design a strategy for implementing this new guideline into practice, working with GPs to change their practice where needed. We will test the effect of this strategy on the care of people with dementia, on their quality of life and on that of their carers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Colette Browning","data":{"first_name":"Colette","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023826","middle_name":"Joy","last_name":"Browning","source_individual_id":"5012371","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Colette Browning"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83117","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Barbara Workman","data":{"first_name":"Barbara","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023094","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Workman","source_individual_id":"5018497","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Barbara Workman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82949","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Joanne Mckenzie","data":{"first_name":"Joanne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020774","middle_name":"Ellen","last_name":"Mckenzie","source_individual_id":"RMIS2992132","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Joanne Mckenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82314","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Denise O'Connor","data":{"first_name":"Denise","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015319","middle_name":"Ann","last_name":"O'Connor","source_individual_id":"5011904","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Denise O'Connor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80858","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Duncan Mortimer","data":{"first_name":"Duncan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015093","middle_name":"Stuart","last_name":"Mortimer","source_individual_id":"5016566","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Duncan Mortimer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80789","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sally Green","data":{"first_name":"Sally","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013337","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Green","source_individual_id":"RMIS379483","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sally Green"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80306","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leon Flicker","data":{"first_name":"Leon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013045","middle_name":"","last_name":"Flicker","source_individual_id":"RMIS145624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leon Flicker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80226","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Claire Harris","data":{"first_name":"Claire","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002048","middle_name":"","last_name":"Harris","source_individual_id":"5015093","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Claire Harris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77226","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62503","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Phase contrast X-ray imaging of the lung at birth","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["Birth","Lung aeration","Neonatal Lung disease","Neonatal ventilation","Phase contrast X-ray imaging"],"nhmrc_grant_id":491103,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Neonatal chronic lung disease","Neonatal respiratory distress","Preterm birth"],"scientific_title":"Phase contrast X-ray imaging of the lung at birth","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Stuart Hooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/491103","simplified_title":"Imaging the lung at birth in preterm infants","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"519890.16","source_system":"Respiratory failure at birth is a major cause of death and disease in newborn infants.

effectiveness of chronic diease prevention in Australia","sub_type":"Health Services Research","total_budget":"1951463.84","source_system":"The purpose of this program of research is to improve the effectiveness of chronic disease prevention in Australia. The focus is to develop epidemiological models that can assist policy-makers to make more informed choices of which preventive programs to fund, improve the ability of clinicians to provide accurate preventive advice and to increase the ability of consumers to make decisions about preventive activities (that may relate to themselves or their communities). Australian population trends over coming years will be dominated by increasing numbers of elderly and a continuing increase in average lifespan. A priority for preventive healthcare is to maintain the elderly in a healthy active state, free of chronic disease, for as long as possible. Options to achieve this are increasing but vary in terms of likely effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Since many of the costs and benefits of preventive programs occur beyond the time-scale of major intervention trials, the prediction of long-term benefits requires the integration of information from multiple sources including trials, epidemiological studies, risk-factor surveys and demography through a process referred to as epidemiological modelling. This project has major relevance to consumers, allied health professionals and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. One outcome of the project will be to allow consumers to make informed decisions about their preventive health care and will assist allied health professionals providing preventive advice to patients. These include occupational health nurses, health promotion officers, Aboriginal health workers and nurse practitioners."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Anna Peeters","data":{"first_name":"Anna","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044767","middle_name":"","last_name":"Peeters","source_individual_id":"RMIS225084","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Anna Peeters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88582","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Nelson","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038748","middle_name":"Raymond","last_name":"Nelson","source_individual_id":"5012083","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Mark Nelson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87035","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bruce Hollingsworth","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037332","middle_name":"Philip","last_name":"Hollingsworth","source_individual_id":"5011888","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Bruce Hollingsworth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86672","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Maximilian De Courten","data":{"first_name":"Maximilian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030306","middle_name":"P","last_name":"De Courten","source_individual_id":"5014260","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Maximilian De Courten"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84861","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brian Oldenburg","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015341","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Oldenburg","source_individual_id":"RMIS7111213","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Brian Oldenburg"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80864","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mcneil","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014912","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Mcneil","source_individual_id":"RMIS105920","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mcneil"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80737","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62058","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Using data to improve quality of healthcare","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["Epidermiology","Health services","Health services research","Inequalities in health services access and outcome","Population-based record linkage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":465129,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Using data to improve quality of healthcare","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Peter Cameron","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/465129","simplified_title":"Using data to improve quality of healthcare","sub_type":"Health Services Research","total_budget":"2795479.85","source_system":"In virtually every major industry, quality improvement has been based on measuring and monitoring performance. There is good evidence to show that when processes and outcome data is measured and compared, improvements are made. Healthcare has been slow to introduce systematic measurement across the sector, however internationally this is rapidly changing. In Australia, we have data available to measure quality and safety; however it is not collected systematically or consistently between states and territories. Our aim is to develop a national set of high quality, credible indicators using existing data sources to measure healthcare performance in regard to safety and quality in clinical practice. We propose a �probes in the pudding� approach, where each probe measures the performance of one aspect of the healthcare system. Coded administrative hospital data collected mainly for financial reasons has potential to be used as quality indicators. However, to provide an accurate picture, indicators must take into account people�s risk factors over which the doctor has no control but which can influence outcome. For example, a hospital in an area surrounded by a principally elderly population would be more likely to have a higher death rate than a hospital admitting younger patients. In effect, indicators must compare apples with apples. We will further test ways in which clinical patient information databases can be linked to develop quality indicators. For example, by linking pharmacy data with hospital data we can monitor whether patients are receiving appropriate medication. The most reliable data for use in measuring quality exists in registries, which have been established for a number of procedures and conditions in Australia. We will investigate ways in which registries can be better standardised at a national level. We will compare registry data with administrative hospital data to investigate how quality indicators can be developed which provide an accurate picture of the health system. This program will succeed because it can be implemented at a low cost using data readily available in most Australian health settings. The group doing the research consists of consumer advocates and people with knowledge in the use of administrative data and registries, health policy, law, research design and statistics."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Cameron","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041434","middle_name":"Alistair","last_name":"Cameron","source_individual_id":"5012134","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Cameron"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87747","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Donald Campbell","data":{"first_name":"Donald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035696","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Campbell","source_individual_id":"RMIS27742","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Donald Campbell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86243","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Johannes Stoelwinder","data":{"first_name":"Johannes","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028188","middle_name":"Uiltje","last_name":"Stoelwinder","source_individual_id":"5012132","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Johannes Stoelwinder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84281","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Sprivulis","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028104","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Sprivulis","source_individual_id":"5017661","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Sprivulis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84254","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Forbes","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024874","middle_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Forbes","source_individual_id":"5012745","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Forbes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83393","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mcneil","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014912","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Mcneil","source_individual_id":"RMIS105920","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mcneil"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80737","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62057","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Greek & Italian residents with dementia in aged care: Language use, psychiatric medication,quaity of life & satisfaction","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Aged Care","Dementia","Language"],"nhmrc_grant_id":465125,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Greek & Italian residents with dementia in aged care: Language use, psychiatric medication,quaity of life & satisfaction","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Daniel O'Connor","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/465125","simplified_title":"Greek & Italian residents with dementia in aged care: Language use, psychiatric medication,quaity of life & satisfaction","sub_type":"Dementia Research Grants Program","total_budget":"194543.08","source_system":"Australia has a growing older migrant population and rates of dementia in residential care are high.

The study will extend our pilot research, which focused on language use, and will also measure a number of factors that may influence the rate of communication, including prescribed psychiatric medication, language proficiency, cognitive impairment and behavioural-psychiatric symptoms. Additionally, the project will compare factors that may differ between the facility types, to provide further understanding of services offered.

Particular sets of genes combine to form a signal transduction pathway that coordinates the cell's response to its environment during the course of normal fetal growth. One such pathway is called the Hedgehog signal transduction pathway which has been shown to coordinated cell division and patterning within malignant and normal tissues. Genes encoding components of this pathway are mutated in the most common forms of human cancers. Understanding how this pathway is regulated is critical to designing strategies to treat the onset and progression of these cancers. The studies outlined in this grant plan to study a new component of this pathway that we have identified in our laboratory, in an easy to study vertebrate model, the zebrafish embryo. We plan to study how this class of proteins, termed scube proteins, acts to control activation of the pathway.

Recent evidence has indicated that a patient intervention strategy is useful for preventing in-hospital falls as a part of a multi-factorial falls prevention program. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness and economic benefit of two approaches to providing patient education for the prevention of in-hospital falls. Patients at high risk for falls will be recruited from the Princess Alexandra Hospital and be randomly allocated to either a DVD + 4 sessions of face-to-face education with an occupational therapist program, to a DVD alone education program, or to a usual care with no additional education control condition. Patients will be followed up until their discharge from hospital and the number of in-hospital falls they incur will be compared between groups. It is expected that both the DVD + 4 sessions of face-to-face education with an occupational therapist program, to a DVD alone education program will be effective in reducing falls and that the DVD alone education program will demonstrate the greater cost-effectiveness in reducing falls. Stemming from this research, it is anticipated that a cost-effective resource for preventing in-hospital falls will be developed and evaluated such that it can be used in hospitals Australia wide."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kryss Mckenna","data":{"first_name":"Kryss","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038431","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Mckenna","source_individual_id":"RMIS1112438","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Kryss Mckenna"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86956","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sandra Brauer","data":{"first_name":"Sandra","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035524","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Brauer","source_individual_id":"5013589","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Sandra Brauer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86203","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Keith Hill","data":{"first_name":"Keith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025491","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hill","source_individual_id":"RMIS37832","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Keith Hill"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83564","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Terrence Haines","data":{"first_name":"Terrence","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013429","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Haines","source_individual_id":"RMIS3371942","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Terrence Haines"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80328","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr David Oliver","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003777","middle_name":"","last_name":"Oliver","source_individual_id":"RMIS4440932","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr David Oliver"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77716","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61745","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular Mechanisms of PAR2 induced Sensitisation of TRPV4 Channels: Role in Neurogenic Inflammation and Hyperalgesia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["PAR2","Pain","Protein Kinases","Signal Transduction","TRPV4"],"nhmrc_grant_id":454858,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Molecular Mechanisms of PAR2 induced Sensitisation of TRPV4 Channels: Role in Neurogenic Inflammation and Hyperalgesia","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Daniel Poole","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/454858","simplified_title":"Molecular Mechanisms of PAR2 induced Sensitisation of TRPV4 Channels: Role in Neurogenic Inflammation and Hyperalgesia","sub_type":"CJ Martin Biomedical ECF","total_budget":"479616.78","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Daniel Poole","data":{"first_name":"Daniel","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021514","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Poole","source_individual_id":"5017006","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Daniel Poole"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82530","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61586","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular control of neural development in the zebrafish retina","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Bipolar cells","Fate determination","Neural lineage","Retinal development","Transcription factor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":454798,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Molecular control of neural development in the zebrafish retina","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

The research involves a case-crossover study of the risk factors for ERD-related ED admission, as well as a detailed case series of ERD-related ED admissions. The case-crossover investigation will involve a comparison between behaviours occurring prior to the critical drug use episode with typical drug use behaviours and more specifically those occurring prior to a control use episode (another occasion on which ERDs were used). Data will be collected by Researchers positioned in the ED, with information collected on the specifics of the critical and control use episodes through interviews with participants following stabilisation and a return to consciousness. The case series will be established from all ERD-related ED admissions flagged as such by triage nurses. Potential risk factors under study will include the environmental conditions in which the drug was used (eg time of day, physical location), other drug taking behaviour, personal factors (eg asthma, depression) and other dose-related issues (eg amount purchased, source of purchase). Statistical analysis will establish the major differences between the critical, typical and control use episodes. The proposed research will examine risk factors for ERD-related harms within the context of an understanding of the usual practices and behaviour of users of these drugs. Identifying transient change in risk behaviours will provide a foundation for developing contextually-sensitive strategies for harm minimisation. The development of a detailed case series will impact upon the treatment and management of acute ERD-related harms."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Professor Louisa

Even though such programs have been shown to be very effective in improving outcomes after a heart attack, at least 85% of Australians after a heart attack are either unable to access and-or unable to attend such programs due to transport and many other barriers. So, there is an urgent need to identify new, effective, and affordable ways of delivering cardiac rehabilitation programs to people after a heart attack. The proposed telephone-delivered program will be particularly appropriate for disadvantaged people, such as those living in rural and remote areas as well as Indigenous Australians, who do not currently have access to hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. People who have had a heart attack will be recruited from three of Brisbane's largest public teaching hospitals, and will then be randomly assigned to the telephone-delivered cardiac rehabilitation program (Care Management Intervention group) or to a control or Usual Care group. The Care Management Intervention group will receive regular telephone calls from a highly qualified 'Care Manager' based at the renowned National Heart Foundation of Australia telephone support service, 'Heartline'. The Care Manager will help people to manage their heart condition and prevent the reoccurrence of further heart problems. People will also be encouraged to make necessary lifestyle and behavioural changes with the assistance of the Care Manager and some Heart Foundation educational and interactive resources to record their progress. We expect that the program or Care Management Intervention group will have better health outcomes than the control or Usual Care group at 6 and 12 months follow up."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Craig Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Craig","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034195","middle_name":"","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"5023250","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Craig Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85851","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Anna Hawkes","data":{"first_name":"Anna","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031188","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Hawkes","source_individual_id":"5015134","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Anna Hawkes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85079","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Atherton","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029226","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Atherton","source_individual_id":"RMIS2362369","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr John Atherton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84578","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brian Oldenburg","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015341","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Oldenburg","source_individual_id":"RMIS7111213","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Brian Oldenburg"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80864","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61370","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Using conversational computer technology to improve diabetes management: A randomised controlled trial","data":{"media_summary":"Information science-medical informatics","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Automated telephone system","Behavioural Intervention","Chronic Diseases","Secondary Prevention","Type 2 diabetes"],"nhmrc_grant_id":443214,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Chronic Disease","Cost-effectiveness","Diabetes Type 2","Diabetes complications","Information science-medical informatics"],"scientific_title":"Using conversational computer technology to improve diabetes management: A randomised controlled trial","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Preventive Medicine","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Brian Oldenburg","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/443214","simplified_title":"Using the Telephone to Improve Diabetes Management","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"708606.7","source_system":"The diabetes epidemic is a growing challenge for the Australian health care system with over 1 million Australians living with diabetes.

Recent developments in information and communications technologies offer some promising new ways and tools for achieving this. This research will evaluate a computer-controlled, interactive telephone system for improving the management and self-management of Type 2 diabetes in addition to routine care. Patients with Type 2 diabetes will be recruited from Brisbane and each patient will be randomly assigned to receive either this new program or just their usual care from their doctor or Diabetes Clinic. The first group will call the system weekly for six months using a regular phone or a mobile phone if they wish. During the call, they will answer questions by speaking into the phone, listen to feedback and strategies for improving management of their diabetes and then discuss their next targets and behavioural actions. They will receive systematic and tailored advice on blood glucose testing, nutrition and physical activity, as well as medication taking and foot care. The system individualises conversations according to the user s answers and responses over all the interactive sessions. The trial will formally evaluate the clinical impact on blood glucose control and the adoption and maintenance of the targeted health habits, as well as the intervention s cost-effectiveness and users satisfaction with the system.

Although uncommon (occurring in about 1 in 1000 operations), it remains one of the main concerns of patients before their surgery. Recent studies (including our own) have demonstrated that processed EEG monitoring using bispectral index (BIS) can markedly reduce the risk of awareness. Other EEG monitors are being developed, but each have weaknesses. As approximately two million Australians have a general anaesthetic each year, about 2000 will suffer an episode of awareness. More than 60 million people around the world have an anaesthetic, and so the problem is substantial. This suggests the potential benefits (health outcomes, commercial gains) are very great.

At least 60% of people who have had a depressive episode will have another, the vast majority within two years of the index episode, 70% of those who have had two episodes will have a third, and 90% of those with three episodes will have a fourth. The economic burden of depression in Australia has been estimated as perhaps $2.8 billion annually. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an innovative psychological treatment, combining principles of cognitive therapy and mindfulness meditation. It is designed to prevent depressive relapse in people who have recovered from depressive episodes. MBCT aims to teach people to become more aware of, and to relate differently to, their thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations; in particular, to view these thoughts and feelings as passing events in the mind rather than identifying with them. Through gaining these skills in increased awareness of thoughts and feelings, participants in the treatment learn to avoid negative ruminations, which have a powerful role in triggering relapses of depression. Primarily this study aims to examine the effectiveness of MBCT for the first time in Australians with a history of recurring depression. As a large multi-site investigation it will establish the feasibility of bringing MBCT into routine practice in both urban and rural areas of Australia. The study also aims to establish whether the mechanisms by which MBCT is proposed to work - by decreasing rumination, increasing levels of mindfulness and self-awareness - do in fact operate. We also hope to establish whether MBCT also has any impact on anxiety, another disabling condition that commonly occurs with depression. This study will enhance evidence as to whether the treatment of MBCT should be recommended routinely to sufferers with repeated episodes of major depression."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leon Piterman","data":{"first_name":"Leon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039112","middle_name":"","last_name":"Piterman","source_individual_id":"5012376","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Leon Piterman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87141","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham Meadows","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026690","middle_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Meadows","source_individual_id":"5016422","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Graham Meadows"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83910","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Fiona Judd","data":{"first_name":"Fiona","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025851","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Judd","source_individual_id":"5015571","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Fiona Judd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83663","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Zindel Segal","data":{"first_name":"Zindel","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010160","middle_name":"V","last_name":"Segal","source_individual_id":"5030746","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Zindel Segal"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79456","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Martin","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003207","middle_name":"Russell","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS108696","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77554","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61275","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulating Interferon signalling in innate immunity","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Cytokine Receptor","Cytokine Signalling","Interferon","JAK/STAT Pathway","Macrophage activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436880,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Antiviral Immunity","Innate Immunity","Regulation of immune response"],"scientific_title":"Regulating Interferon signalling in innate immunity","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Paul Hertzog","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436880","simplified_title":"New ways to fight infections and inflammatory diseases","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"547428.09","source_system":"Our innate immune system evolved as the front line defence against infection.

This project aims to understand the negative or inhibitory mechanisms that prevent dangerous side effects of interferons without restricting their postive or beneficial effects. We will examine the actions of a molecule called the Suppressor of cytokin Signaling 1 (socs1) which we have recently discovered to modulate the actions of interferon in the mouse. Initially our studies will determine which molecules SOCS1 binds to inside a cell and the consequences for cell activation pathways. The next step will be to specifically block this interaction in the mouse and determine the effects on models of viral infection and inflammatory disease.

Our published and preliminary results show how GPIb-dependent interaction of platelets with von Willebrand factor, the major adhesive ligand for GPIb-IX-V, is dependent on the level of shear stress. Using a cross-species (human to canine) homology-swap approach, where human sequence is replaced by the corresponding canine sequence within discrete structural domains, a sequence of GPIb has been identified which becomes increasingly important as hydrodynamic shear stress increases. It is proposed to further define the interactive surface of GPIb that recognizes von Willebrand factor at increasing shear, and to define the relationship between the shear-dependent alteration of GPIb conformation and its ability to interact with other pro-thrombotic or pro-inflammatory binding partners."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Robert Andrews","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000108","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Andrews","source_individual_id":"5013212","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Robert Andrews"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76682","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61272","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A phase II randomised controlled trial of atorvastatin therapy in intensive care patients with severe sepsis","data":{"media_summary":"sepsis","end_year":2008,"keywords":["clinical trial","inflammatory mediators","lipid biochemistry","sepsis","statins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436873,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["blood cholesterol levels","inflammatory mediators","intensive care","pharmacokinetics","sepsis"],"scientific_title":"A phase II randomised controlled trial of atorvastatin therapy in intensive care patients with severe sepsis","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Intensive Care","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Peter Kruger","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436873","simplified_title":"Statins in Sepsis Study","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"622148.5","source_system":"Infections are common in patients in the intensive care unit and produce inflammation that may spread throughout the body. Despite improved therapies, when infections cause failure of the body's vital organs, up to 40% of patients may die. The medication atorvastatin and other statins have been used for many years to treat and prevent conditions such as heart attack and stroke. They act primarily by reducing cholesterol production. In addition, they also modify inflammation and the immune system which may make them a useful treatment for patients with established infections. Although the statin drugs are usually safe, rare side effects may affect muscle and the liver. Because of concerns about increased risk of side effects it is currently recommended that statins should be stopped when patients become unwell. However, a number of studies have suggested that patients on statins for heart disease are less likely to develop infections and that their infections are less likely to be severe or result in death. Other studies have suggested that stopping statins in patients that present with infections (as suggested by current guidelines), may worsen infection outcomes. However, these studies have not been detailed enough to exclude all factors affecting outcome, such as patient age, severity of the infection, and the presence of other diseases. We plan to perform a study to assess the effect of atorvastatin on the outcome of infections in the intensive care unit. We will study 250 patients presenting with severe infections. We will randomly assign patients to receive either atorvastatin or placebo and monitor the effect on signs of inflammation and levels of life support. Outcomes and side effects will be carefully monitored. The study will help us decide whether to perform a larger study to determine if atorvastatin can reduce the risk of dying from serious infections."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Kruger","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0043614","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Kruger","source_individual_id":"RMIS3702501","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Kruger"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88308","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Roberts","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039362","middle_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Roberts","source_individual_id":"RMIS41002","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Roberts"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87206","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Karam Kostner","data":{"first_name":"Karam","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020174","middle_name":"Maximilian","last_name":"Kostner","source_individual_id":"RMIS1215786","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Karam Kostner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82151","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Cooper","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018392","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Cooper","source_individual_id":"5012505","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Cooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81709","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rinaldo Bellomo","data":{"first_name":"Rinaldo","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017677","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bellomo","source_individual_id":"5012506","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rinaldo Bellomo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81516","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bala Venkatesh","data":{"first_name":"Bala","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016832","middle_name":"","last_name":"Venkatesh","source_individual_id":"RMIS5223868","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bala Venkatesh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81276","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61271","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Fitness versus fatness: Disentangling their effects on disease outcomes and estimating the population burden of disease","data":{"media_summary":"physical activity","end_year":2008,"keywords":["burden of disease","causal modelling","life table modelling","longitudinal study","population health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436866,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","diabetes","mortality","obesity","physical activity"],"scientific_title":"Fitness versus fatness: Disentangling their effects on disease outcomes and estimating the population burden of disease","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew Forbes","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436866","simplified_title":"Fitness versus fatness and burden of disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"188537.5","source_system":"Overweight and physical inactivity are two of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

In addition, the risks of overweight, in particular, have been accused of being exaggerated in both the scientific and lay literature. This is often due to the difficulty of dealing appropriately with time varying confounders which are also intermediate factors (such as hypertension). To date, no studies have performed careful longitudinal modelling of the joint effects of physical inactivity and overweight on cardiovascular events and diabetes while taking into account the effects of factors, such as hypertension or atherosclerosis, that influence both physical activity and overweight as well as disease, and simultaneously are consequences of these risk factors. Standard statistical methods are known to produce biased estimates in these situations but we will apply more recently developed statistical techniques to provide much improved estimation of these effects. After the statistical modelling stage, we will model the burden of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality associated with given levels of overweight and physical inactivity.

This study is directed towards understanding the role of a subset of while blood cells known as NKT cells in the inflammatory process.

Many of these births are premature with neonates requiring intensive care. There is also good evidence that children who are born prematurely with low birth weight are much more likely to develop a host of diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obestiy in adult life increasing the long term burden of health care support. Infertility is often due to the lack of uterine endometrial receptivity while the pregnancy complications arise from the reduced growth of the placenta and sub-optimal interactions between the mother's uterus and the growing placenta. Endometrial infertility, placental growth and interactions with the endometrium is stringently regulated by substances produced at the maternal endometrial- placental interface. To understand how infertility and pregnancy complications arise, develop diagnostic, monitoring and therapeutic tests it is critical to understand the roles played by these regulatory substances. We have novel data suggesting that small proteins known as endogenous opioids could be enchancing endometrial receptivity and the growth and development of the placenta. Interstingly these substances are closely related to exogenous opioids such as heroin and morphine. We will investigate the manner in which these substances regulate endometrial immune cell function, maintain the endometrial stromal cell bed in preparation for pregnancy and direct the growth and differentiation of the placenta. The findings will give novel insights into infertility, improve the success rates of in vitro fertilization, reduce maternal and neonatal complications of pregnancy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ursula Manuelpillai","data":{"first_name":"Ursula","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0008874","middle_name":"","last_name":"Manuelpillai","source_individual_id":"RMIS473178","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ursula Manuelpillai"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79103","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61268","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Is NADPH oxidase the trigger for accelerated atherosclerosis caused by bacteria?","data":{"media_summary":"risk factors for cardiovascular disease","end_year":2009,"keywords":["atherogenesis","bacteria","cardiovascular disease","oxidative stress","superoxide"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436825,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","bacterial infection","cardiovascular disease","oxidative stress","risk factors for cardiovascular disease"],"scientific_title":"Is NADPH oxidase the trigger for accelerated atherosclerosis caused by bacteria?","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436825","simplified_title":"How does bacteria cause artery disease?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"465210.05","source_system":"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and morbidity world-wide. However, its incidence is not fully explained by the presence of conventional risk factors, such as high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes and cigarette smoking. Steadily growing evidence indicates that bacterial infection, particularly by Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori, is also strongly linked to atherosclerotic lesion formation and increased risk of a cardiovascular event. This project will investigate a new aspect to the body s defence against bacterial infection which involves production of oxygen radicals by the blood vessel wall. We propose that although this response of the artery to bacteria in the blood is beneficial in the short term, it inadverently initiates a chronic inflammatory process that ultimately accelerates development of artery disease. If this is the case, the oxygen radical production by the enzyme, NADPH oxidase, in the artery wall may represent the missing link between bacterial infection and atherosclerosis. We will therefore firstly test whether two bacteria, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori, can acutely induce artery inflammation in this way. We will then perform definitive studies to test whether mice infected with these bacteria develop accelerated atherosclerosis, and if so, whether this effect is dependent on NADPH oxidase activity in the artery wall. Finally, we will test the efficacy and importance of timing of antibiotic therapy to prevent atherosclerotic lesion formation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anna Walduck","data":{"first_name":"Anna","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040286","middle_name":"Katrina","last_name":"Walduck","source_individual_id":"RMIS3181173","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Anna Walduck"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87438","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond","data":{"first_name":"Grant","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030471","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Drummond","source_individual_id":"RMIS2457825","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84911","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016332","middle_name":"Graeme","last_name":"Sobey","source_individual_id":"5017621","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81135","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61267","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Anti-atherosclerotic effects of angiotensin fragments & non-AT1 receptors: Validation as innovative therapeutic targets","data":{"media_summary":"vascular remodeling","end_year":2009,"keywords":["angiotensin","angiotensin receptors","atherosclerosis","endothelial dysfunction","pharmacology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436823,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","endothelial dysfunction during atherosclerosis","pharmacology","vascular reactivity","vascular remodeling"],"scientific_title":"Anti-atherosclerotic effects of angiotensin fragments & non-AT1 receptors: Validation as innovative therapeutic targets","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Robert Widdop","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436823","simplified_title":"Diverse actions of angiotensin peptides and their receptors in cardiovascular disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"512065.08","source_system":"In Australia the largest cause of death is coronary heart disease (CHD) leading to heart attacks or stroke and claiming a staggering 28,000 lives a year. Atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular disease, with diseased vessels not able to fully dilate and the plaque that has built up inside these vessels impeding blood flow and possibly rupturing, resulting in heart attacks and stroke. One of the major players in the development and progression of atherosclerosis is the hormone, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has been found to trigger many factors that cause thickening of the vessel wall, inflammation and imbalances in vasodilator capacity (e.g. oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction), all of which contribute to atherosclerosis. Clinical trials with drugs that inhibit the formation of angiotensin II (ACE inhibitors), or block the action of angiotensin II (angiotensin receptor antagonists), have demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality in patients with high risk for cardiovascular disease. However their mechanism(s) of action are not fully understood as the circulating levels of shorter fragments of angiotensin II (such as Ang IV and Ang (1-7)) are raised in the blood when these drugs are used and may contribute to the protective effects of these drugs. Importantly, we have found that both Ang IV and Ang (1-7) have protective effects in atherosclerotic blood vessels. Therefore, we hypothesise that fragments of angiotensin II (such as Ang IV and others) exert anti-atherogenic effects via distinct binding sites that oppose the effects caused by angiotensin II, and that these may be partly responsible for the cardio-protective effects of the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. Thus, information gained in our study will be useful in directing future prescription practices in clinical management of CHD and stroke, and for designing new therapeutic compounds for the management of atherosclerosis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond","data":{"first_name":"Grant","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030471","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Drummond","source_individual_id":"RMIS2457825","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84911","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Widdop","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022976","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Widdop","source_individual_id":"5018294","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Widdop"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82922","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Harald Schmidt","data":{"first_name":"Harald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016098","middle_name":"Hhw","last_name":"Schmidt","source_individual_id":"5011184","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Harald Schmidt"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81056","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61266","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of post-traumatic hypoxia in the exacerbation of cerebral inflammatory response elicited by brain injury","data":{"media_summary":"Role of hypoxia in determining degree of inflammation","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Animal model of traumatic brain injury","Brain marker of damage","Hypoxia","Neuroinflammation","Traumatic brain injury"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436815,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Brain trauma can cause permanent neurological disability","Hypoxia contributes to (secondary) brain injury","Neuroinflammation can result in poor outcome","Prognostic value to cytokines and cellular injury markers","Role of hypoxia in determining degree of inflammation"],"scientific_title":"Role of post-traumatic hypoxia in the exacerbation of cerebral inflammatory response elicited by brain injury","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurosciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Cristina Morganti-Kossmann","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436815","simplified_title":"Brain injury and inflammation after severe head injury with hypoxia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"397535.49","source_system":"Traumatic brain injury is the major cause of death in the young population below the age of 40 years. Approximately 25% of patients that survive head injury remain with permanent neurological disabilities with considerable family, professional and economic costs. Extensive research has shown that not all brain damage occurs at the time of injury, but rather evolves over the hours and days following trauma. Secondary injury may result from various factors including hypoxia (insufficient oxygen) as a consequence of respiratory distress that occurs in about 50% of patients with severe head trauma. Hypoxia is known to significantly worsen the neurological impairment and potentially lead to death. Brain injury and hypoxia have the ability to separately trigger cerebral inflammation. A dual role has been attributed to inflammation: to promote tissue repair but also add further damage through the release of neurotoxic substances. We hypothesise that hypoxia occurring after traumatic brain injury enhances the inflammatory response in the brain and aggravate tissue damage as well as neurological dysfunction. This hypothesis will be tested on a rat model of brain injury whereby the animals will be exposed to moderate-severe hypoxia immediately after trauma. The production of multiple inflammatory mediators will be quantified in the brain tissue and also in cerebrospinal fluid. The concentration of these mediators will be compared with the levels of cellular injury proteins known to increase following injury to determine whether a correlation exists. In a clinical study on patients, we will measure the same inflammatory mediators and proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of individuals with severe head injury. The suitability of these factors for potential use as diagnostic-prognostic markers of either hypoxia or injury will be determined."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Kossmann","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037829","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Kossmann","source_individual_id":"RMIS1649918","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Kossmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86798","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Cristina Morganti-Kossmann","data":{"first_name":"Cristina","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015074","middle_name":"","last_name":"Morganti-Kossmann","source_individual_id":"5016542","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Cristina Morganti-Kossmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80782","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61265","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of PLZF in regulating the Interferon response","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Inhibition on cancer cell growth","Innate immunity","Interferon non-responders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436814,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Interferon","Renal"],"scientific_title":"Role of PLZF in regulating the Interferon response","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Bryan Williams","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436814","simplified_title":"Role of PLZF in regulating the Interferon response","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"531696.74","source_system":"The Interferon (IFN) pathway is essential for immune defense against pathogens in vertebrates. IFNs both protect and alert cells about viral, bacterial, and other immune assaults and promote a cellular antiviral state, reduce proliferation, or induce apoptosis depending on the cell type and environment. Based on these properties, IFNs have been used clinically against a variety of diseases including viral infections, immunomodulatory disorders and hematologic and solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma. However, the factors determining outcome of IFN treatment, remain to be determined. We have identified a subset of interferon stimulated genes whose sustained expression was found to correlate with heightened antiviral sensitivity of renal cell carcinoma cell lines to IFN. Many of these genes were found to have binding sites for the transcriptional repressor promyleocytic zinc finger protein (PLZF). PLZF was first identified in a subset of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia patients and is involved in maintenance of erythroid lineage stem cells and spermatogonial stem cells in male mice. PLZF has not previously been implicated in the IFN response. Accordingly, we investigated the expression of interferon stimulated genes and showed that increased expression of immune related genes depends on PLZF expression. PLZF was also found to directly associate with binding sites in promoters of interferon stimulated genes and that this requires histone deacetylation. Thus, we uncovered a novel function for PLZF in enhancement of IFN associated gene expression. We propose to test the hypothesis that PLZF is an essential component of the IFN response. As a corollary, we will also test whether PLZF expression can be linked to IFN responsiveness in renal cell carcinoma. These studies will establish the role of PLZF in the IFN response and define its utility in predicting IFN responsiveness in therapeutic applications."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bryan Williams","data":{"first_name":"Bryan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040463","middle_name":"Raymond George","last_name":"Williams","source_individual_id":"5018330","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Bryan Williams"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87486","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61264","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Copper Homeostasis and APP-induced Neurodegeneration in Drosophila","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","Copper transport","Drosophila","amyloid precursor protein","metal metabolism"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436806,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Alzheimer disease","Amyloid beta protein","Neurodegenerative disease"],"scientific_title":"Copper Homeostasis and APP-induced Neurodegeneration in Drosophila","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurogenetics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Dr Richard Burke","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436806","simplified_title":"Modelling the role of copper in an insect model of Alzheimer's disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"381223.37","source_system":"Alzheimer s disease, a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder suffered by many of our elderly, is characterised by the presence of abnormal protein accumulations called plaques in the brains of affected patients. Plaques contain amyloid protein and also have high levels of the essential metals copper and zinc. Copper is needed for the formation of these protein aggregations and increases the toxic effects of amyloid, leading to the idea that copper-binding chemicals could be used to treat Alzheimer s disease. However experiments in animal models have produced conflicting results, some suggesting that increased copper levels protect against neuronal damage while others claim the opposite effect. Comparison of these studies is hampered by the different experimental systems used. We will clarify the role of copper in the progression of Alzheimer s disease using a simple insect model, the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Production of amyloid in Drosophila neuronal tissues produces a neurodegenerative effect similar to that seen in human brains, but in a matter of weeks rather than the years required in humans. We will combine production of amyloid with production of copper uptake and export proteins to investigate the effect of changing copper levels. We will also test the effect of increasing copper and other metals in the diet to see whether dietary levels are an important factor in disease progression. Finally, we will use the Drosophila model to test large numbers of metal binding compounds and drugs for ones that slow or halt the neuronal damage caused by amyloid production, identifying potential therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. This work will provide a vital and definitive clarification of the role of copper in the progression of Alzheimer s disease and potentially lead to the development of novel treatments for this disease that is rapidly becoming a major social and economic problem in the developed world."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Richard Burke","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006333","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Burke","source_individual_id":"5013688","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Richard Burke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78425","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Camakaris","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000692","middle_name":"","last_name":"Camakaris","source_individual_id":"RMIS97666","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Camakaris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76856","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61263","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Central neural mechanisms underlying the effect of endocannabinoids on body weight","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Cannabis","Fat Metabolism","Hypothalamus","Obesity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436802,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Adiposity and Obesity","Obesity","Obesity Prevention"],"scientific_title":"Central neural mechanisms underlying the effect of endocannabinoids on body weight","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Brian Oldfield","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436802","simplified_title":"The action of endocannabinoids in the brain on body weight","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"377793.78","source_system":"Obesity and its associated pathologies of cardiovascular and respiratory disease, stroke, predisposition to some cancers and infertility in women no longer needs to be justified as a major health issue in modern societies.

Specifically a cannabinoid receptor antagonist, rimonabant (currently undergoing trials as Accomplia) has become a central player in the race for an obesity therapy because of its effects in blocking the brain receptors that would normally respond to cannabinoid like compounds in the brain that tend to increase food intake. Despite the trials that are underway in Europe and the USA many of the central actions of the naturally occurring cannabinoids in the brain, the so-called endocannabinoids are very poorly understood. This series of experiments utilizing the best technologies available will address basic questions relating to the brain pathways involved and even the extent to which weight loss associated with the administration of these drugs to rats and presumably humans is dependent on the reduction of food intake or the burning of energy in a process called thermogenesis.

It classically causes disease of the small bowel, resulting in impaired absorption of important nutrients, and is treated by a restrictive diet eliminating foods containing extracts of these grains. However, it has recently been found that CD is much commoner than previously thought (about 1 in 100-200), and often causes only non-specific symptoms. Two important conditions linked to CD by some, but not all, researchers are ataxia (incoordination) and impairment of thinking and memory. The problem is that many normal people (12% of the population) have antibodies to gluten, so that studies suggesting that sensitivity to gluten, as determined by the presence of antibodies, causes these brain disorders are not conclusive. That is, this could be a chance association. Furthermore, there is some evidence that damage to the coordination part of the brain (the cerebellum) from other causes may also cause antibodies to gluten. It is quite possible that antibodies to the cerebellum can cross-react with gluten, and vice versa. In this case, treating patients with ataxia and antibodies to gluten with the restrictive diet may be treating the result rather than the cause of the disorder. This project will study patients with CD (proven on small bowel biopsy) with sensitive, objective methods, including MRI, electronic measures of coordination, and psychological tests of thinking and memory, to see whether CD really is associated with these two problems. It will also study coordination and brain structure in a mouse model of CD. If the associations are proven, all patients with these disorders will need to be tested for CD, and treated with the restrictive diet if found to be positive. If not, clinicians will be confident that testing for anti-gluten antibodies would be irrelevant and misleading in these two situations."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Robert Anderson","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035101","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Anderson","source_individual_id":"5011510","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Robert Anderson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86098","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glynda Kinsella","data":{"first_name":"Glynda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020126","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Kinsella","source_individual_id":"5015721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Glynda Kinsella"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82138","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elsdon Storey","data":{"first_name":"Elsdon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016466","middle_name":"","last_name":"Storey","source_individual_id":"RMIS137151","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elsdon Storey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81172","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Cook","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012447","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Cook","source_individual_id":"RMIS5644","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Cook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80066","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61260","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Prevalence and genetic mechanisms of neurological and gynaecological changes in women carrying small FMR1 expansions","data":{"media_summary":"neurodegenerative disease","end_year":2009,"keywords":["fragile X","menopause","molecular genetics","neurodegeneration"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436787,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Fragile X syndrome","cognitive decline","female menopause","molecular genetics","neurodegenerative disease"],"scientific_title":"Prevalence and genetic mechanisms of neurological and gynaecological changes in women carrying small FMR1 expansions","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurogenetics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof Elsdon Storey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436787","simplified_title":"Brain and ovarian changes in mothers of children with Fragile-X mental retardation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"411895.1","source_system":"Fragile X syndrome is one of the commonest genetic forms of mental retardation.

Therefore, grandfathers of the affected children on their mother's side, as well as the mothers, may carry a mildly abnormal gene (a premutation), insufficient to cause mental retardation. However, it has recently been discovered that these grandfathers may develop a syndrome (FXTAS) of tremor, incoordination, slowness of movements and mild dementia in their later years.

This study aims to see how common and severe these abnormalities are in women who carry the premutation, using clinical, MRI and electronic measurements, and to relate the abnormalities to the severity of the gene malfunction and familial predisposition."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Danuta Loesch","data":{"first_name":"Danuta","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020458","middle_name":"Z","last_name":"Loesch","source_individual_id":"RMIS74228","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Danuta Loesch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82229","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Flora Tassone","data":{"first_name":"Flora","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016572","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tassone","source_individual_id":"RMIS3066374","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Flora Tassone"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81202","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elsdon Storey","data":{"first_name":"Elsdon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016466","middle_name":"","last_name":"Storey","source_individual_id":"RMIS137151","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elsdon Storey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81172","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Cook","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012447","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Cook","source_individual_id":"RMIS5644","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Cook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80066","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Huggins","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008020","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Huggins","source_individual_id":"RMIS74231","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Huggins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78870","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61259","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms and Regulation of ACE2 Shedding","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Ectodomain Shedding","Enzyme regulation","Protease","renin angiotensin system"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436784,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Chronic Liver Disease","Ischemia","Protease","cardiovascular disease"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms and Regulation of ACE2 Shedding","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Moreover, it has been shown that the RAMP-receptor interface is a viable target for drug development. Understanding the extent to which RAMPs interact with G protein-coupled receptors, how they interact with the receptors and the consequences of this interaction forms the basis of the current proposal.

Modulation of receptors, therefore, forms a key target in our ability to treat disease. The largest class of receptors is the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which transmit signals within a cell via proteins called G proteins. GPCRs form between 1 and 5% of the entire repertoire of human genes. One group of GPCRs provide the target for small protein molecules that cirulate through the body. One such circulating molecule is calcitonin, a peptide that plays an important role in maintaining circulating calcium levels in the body, which is essential for proper maintenance of the skeleton. As a consequence of this action, calcitonin is an important clinically used tool in the treatment of bone disease such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease. Due to the molecular nature of calcitonin and its receptors (and other related receptors) that have a broad, complex mechanism of interaction, we have very little definitive information on how calcitonin interfaces with its receptor to signal to target cells. The current project utilises a novel method of permanently linking calcitonin to its receptor, allowing identification of how the two components come together. Furthermore, the project will explore the functional consequence of naturally occuring genetic variation (genotype) and also examine whether the occurence of specific calcitonin receptor genotype is correlated with disease markers for osteoporosis and obesity. This information provides important fundamentals for understanding how this and related receptors work and the potential for rational design of improved theraupeutic tools."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Laurence Miller","data":{"first_name":"Laurence","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038561","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Miller","source_individual_id":"RMIS3859474","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Laurence Miller"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86990","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Patrick Sexton","data":{"first_name":"Patrick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022037","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Sexton","source_individual_id":"RMIS5568","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Patrick Sexton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82677","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ruben Abagyan","data":{"first_name":"Ruben","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017349","middle_name":"","last_name":"Abagyan","source_individual_id":"RMIS3835168","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ruben Abagyan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81418","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61256","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Understanding selective drug signaling at G protein-coupled receptors","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["G-protein coupled receptor","bioluminescence resonance energy transfer","ligand binding","molecular pharmacology","receptor activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436779,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","diabetes","neurological disease","osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Understanding selective drug signaling at G protein-coupled receptors","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Patrick Sexton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436779","simplified_title":"Can we find more selective drugs?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"362206.8","source_system":"The maintenance of optimum health and function living cells, and consequently that of the whole organism, depends on how cells respond to a multitude of physical and chemical stimuli that continually bombard them.

Eph proteins have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity that becomes active after binding ephrins on neighbouring cells. Once active, they instruct these cells to change their shape and their adhesion to the substratum or between each other, and to become more motile. In adult organisms Ephs and ephrins are low in most cells, but they re-appear in many tumors. For example, when normal cells in the skin (melanocytes) become tumor cells, they often will have Ephs and ephrins on their surface. It is believed that these proteins will now affect if these melanoma cells will migrate and to which locations within the body. In our studies we will examine what controls the activity of Eph proteins. In particular, a class of enzymes called tyrosine phosphatases are known to regulate the function of tyrosine kinase receptors, however it is not clear which particular phosphatase regulates EphA3, the focus of our studies. We will find out, which set of phosphatases regulates EphA3 function and whether exposure to oxidative conditions, such as UV radiation, also activates Ephs and instructs tumour cells to become more motile and to invade other areas of the body.

Our recent study demonstrated BM-derived stem cells can also transform to renal myofibroblasts, the major cell type that contributes to the development of kidney scarring. This suggests that BM-derived adult stem cells have dual roles: to repair or worsen the development of renal scarring. The present study investigates this adult stem cell's transformation and explores the potential measures to enhance the benefits and to block the harmful roles from these adult stem cells. The importance of BM-derived stem cells in the repair of damaged kidney will be determined and thus will provide preliminary insights into the future utilization of BM-derived stem cells in the treatment of chronic renal disease. Understanding the dual roles of BM-derived stem cells in experimental renal scarring, will lead us to question our current thinking and approaches to the treatment and management of renal fibrosis, and perhaps fibrosis in other organs.

A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with physiotherapists, chiropractors and the patients of both will be conducted to identify the barriers and enablers to implementation of the evidence-based clinical practice guideline. The interviews will be underpinned by a theoretical framework grounded in behavioural theory. Information from the interviews will be used to develop a survey to canvas views of a larger population of chiropractors and physiotherapists. The results of the interviews and survey will inform the development of a targeted implementation strategy suitable for use in private physiotherapy and chiropractic clinics. Potential interventions include educational strategies, patient and practitioner information via various media, reminder systems and peer leadership. A cluster randomised controlled trial (C-RCT) will then be conducted to determine the effects of the strategy.

Blood clots can lead to stroke. While a very effective drug, it is also a dangerous drug because it can lead to thin blood which makes it more likely that they will bleed. For this reason, the drug should be closely monitored. We know that many people do suffer catastrophic bleeds because the blood is too thin directly as a result of taking warfarin. Some of the reasons for these bleeds are well known; they may be taking drugs that interact with warfarin, they may have problems with their liver or kidney which affects the body's ability to get rid of it, they may have suffered a fall, to name a few. Studies done overseas have suggested that people are more likely to have a bleed if they do not know how to properly manage their tablets, if they are depressed, if they have no helpers to support them or if their care is not well organised. In Australia, we do not know what impact the organisation of care has on whether a person's warfarin is well managed. We do not know the impact that depression has on their care, or whether people are more likely to have pooorly controlled warfarin if they have few community ties. These are importnat questions to answer, so that we can make significant inroads into preventing death and disability from warfarin."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Cameron","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041434","middle_name":"Alistair","last_name":"Cameron","source_individual_id":"5012134","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Cameron"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87747","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Dooley","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030439","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Dooley","source_individual_id":"5027954","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Dooley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84900","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mcneil","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014912","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Mcneil","source_individual_id":"RMIS105920","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mcneil"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80737","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rory Wolfe","data":{"first_name":"Rory","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011139","middle_name":"St.John","last_name":"Wolfe","source_individual_id":"5018441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rory Wolfe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79728","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61250","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Acute alerting effects of daytime exposure to specific wavelengths of light","data":{"media_summary":"sleepiness","end_year":2009,"keywords":["EEG","circadian rhythm","light sensitivity","melatonin","spectrophotometry"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436758,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["behaviour","cognition","photobiology","sleep deprivation","sleepiness"],"scientific_title":"Acute alerting effects of daytime exposure to specific wavelengths of light","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Shanthakumar Wilson Rajaratnam","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436758","simplified_title":"The effectiveness of exposure to different colours of light in improving alertness during the day after sleep loss","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"446367.15","source_system":"Excessive sleepiness is the greatest identifiable and preventable cause of accidents in all modes of transportation. Shift workers working outside the 8am-5pm day, make up about 20% of the urban working population. These individuals often report excessive daytime sleepiness caused by irregular sleep-wake patterns and long-term sleep loss. Excessive sleepiness is also common in individuals with sleep disorders. While there are many stimulant and wake-promoting drugs available to counteract daytime fatigue such drugs have problems of side effects, interactions and in some cases dependence. Light has many beneficial effects for a wide range of medicinal, physiological, psychological, and social purposes. One well known effect is as a stimulant so that exposure to bright light, both during the night and in the middle of the day, improves alertness and attention, and decreases reaction times thus improving performance. These effects can also be measured as changes in brain activity. However we do not understand the mechanisms in the eyes which control these effects. While certain cells in the eyes called rods and cones are necessary for seeing objects clearly and for detecting colour, there appears to be another system in the eyes which may involve different specialized cells or photoreceptors that are important for the alerting effects of light. White light is made up of different wavelengths or colours of light. This study will examine which wavelength (blue, violet, red or green) of light best improves alertness and learning during the daytime. Various performance tests will be used in addition to measures of brain wave activity. By identifying the most effective wavelength of light for improving alertness in healthy young adults and better understanding the mechanisms in the eyes involved, we will be able to develop light treatment strategies in patient groups with sleep disorders and in individuals like shift workers who experience sleep loss."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shanthakumar Wilson Rajaratnam","data":{"first_name":"Shanthakumar","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028872","middle_name":"Madhan","last_name":"Wilson Rajaratnam","source_individual_id":"RMIS4319944","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Shanthakumar Wilson Rajaratnam"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84482","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Steven Lockley","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014529","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Lockley","source_individual_id":"5016039","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Steven Lockley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80629","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Jennifer Redman","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0009848","middle_name":"","last_name":"Redman","source_individual_id":"RMIS4319947","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jennifer Redman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79374","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61249","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structural and Functional Studies on Glutamate Decarboxylase.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Antipsychotic","Brain metabolism","Diabetes","GABA","Schizophrenia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436740,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Depressive disorders","Diabetes","Epilepsy","Schizophrenia and psychotic disorders"],"scientific_title":"Structural and Functional Studies on Glutamate Decarboxylase.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr James Whisstock","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436740","simplified_title":"Structural and Functional Studies on Glutamate Decarboxylase.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"500460.05","source_system":"This proposal aims to determine the molecular structure of the two known isoforms of Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67). GAD in an essential human enzyme that is responsible for synthesising the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA functions in the human Central Nervous System (CNS) to dampen down excitatory signals. Proper control of GABA synthesis is important and perturbations in GABA levels lies behind human diseases such as intractable epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia. As a result of this role, numerous common therapeutics (for example benzodiazepines) target proteins involved in the GABA neurotransmitter system. The goal of this proposal is to use the molecular structures of GAD to understand how to achieve fine control of GABA production. In addition to its role in the CNS, GAD is an important human autoantigen. Antibodies to one isoform of GAD, GAD65, are found in most patients with type I diabetes as well as certain patients with the movement disorder stiff person syndrome and related diseases of the CNS. It is suggested that the development of auto-antibodies may play a key role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Despite sharing >80% sequence similarity with GAD65, autoantibodies to the other isoform of GAD, GAD67, are rarely found in patients with disease. The aim of this grant is to characterise the region of GAD that is targetted by autoantibodes. These data will allow us to understand why certain autoantibodes are able to inhibit GAD enzyme activity and why GAD65, but not GAD67 is recognised by autoantibodes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Whisstock","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040415","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Whisstock","source_individual_id":"5018263","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof James Whisstock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87471","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Merrill Rowley","data":{"first_name":"Merrill","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015983","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Rowley","source_individual_id":"RMIS97888","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Merrill Rowley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81027","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61248","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel generic vaccine approaches applied for the prevention of hepatitis C and influenza virus infections.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["DNA vaccine","Vaccine development, delivery of B-cell and CTL epitopes","Virus-like particle","hepatitis C","influenza"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436729,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Development of hepatitis C and influenza vaccine","Hepatitis C and B","Infection control","Vaccine strategy"],"scientific_title":"Novel generic vaccine approaches applied for the prevention of hepatitis C and influenza virus infections.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Hans Netter","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436729","simplified_title":"Design of vaccination tools directed against infectious pathogens of major health concern","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"392328.39","source_system":"For the induction of good immune responses, antigens should be delivered in several copies on a defined particle. The small envelope protein (HBsAg) encoded by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) has the capacity to self-assemble with host derived lipids into VLPs. HBsAg VLPs are the sole component of one of the most successful vaccines, and clinical trials have shown that they are a successful delivery system for foreign epitopes or protein domains. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Influenza viruses are major human pathogens. HCV has infected 200 million people worldwide, and there is no effective vaccine available. Influenza continues to affect thousands of people each year causing epidemics with severe morbidity and considerable mortality. Current influenza vaccines are mostly inactivated formulations and they exhibit poor immunogenicity in immunological naive persons such as children and in the elderly. The influenza vaccines are not optimal for stimulation of cell-mediated immunity. We propose to use particulate antigens as a delivery platform for influenza and HCV-specific epitopes with the focus to develop approaches to target various HCV and influenza strains, including H5N1 bird influenza. We have successfully produced modified VLPs containing HCV-specific sequences, which are able to induce anti-HCV antibodies with neutralising capacity. We hypothesise that the design of VLPs with an appropriate set of HCV-specific antigens will enhance the neutralising capacity of anti-HCV sera and this may overcome strain specificity. This application will exploit a prototype delivery system to induce antibody and also cellular responses against a variety of HCV- and influenza specific target sequences (epitopes). The outcome of this study will be a prototype multivalent vaccine to a range of HCV- and influenza-specific epitopes. As a delivery system this will be ideal for vaccination against agents that are highly variable."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Turner","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034379","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Turner","source_individual_id":"RMIS2275540","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Turner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85903","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Hans Netter","data":{"first_name":"Hans","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032826","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Netter","source_individual_id":"5016677","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Hans Netter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85500","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Boyd","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017852","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Boyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS8290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Boyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81554","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61247","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomised controlled trial of the effect of substantial weight loss on obstructive sleep apnoea.","data":{"media_summary":"Weight loss","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Obesity","Quality of life","Sleep disordered breathing/Sleep apnoea","Surgical and non-surgical cohorts","Weight loss"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436728,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Airway obstruction","Obesity","Sleep disordered breathing/sleep apnoea/Sleepiness","Surgical outcomes research","Weight loss"],"scientific_title":"A randomised controlled trial of the effect of substantial weight loss on obstructive sleep apnoea.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr John Dixon","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436728","simplified_title":"A randomised controlled trial of the effect of substantial weight loss on obstructive sleep apnoea.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"404061.24","source_system":"Obstructive sleep apnea is now commonly recognized as a major health problem and frequently ocurrs in overweight or obese individuals. Several studies have now demonstrated that weight loss can be an effective treatment for sleep apnea in those with a weight problem. But, it is extremely difficult to achieve and sustain the major weight loss required to adequately treat this condition. Modern obesity surgery is the only reliable method of achieving and sustaining major weight loss in very obese individuals, and several studies have found that along with weight loss there are major improvements in sleep symptoms, and sleep apnea following weight loss surgery. Despite these findings surgery is rarely advised and has never been formally tested as a therapy for sleep apnea. We propose to formally test, for the first time, the effectiveness of weight loss surgery, as an addition to best conventional therapy, in those individuals with the combination of problems; obesity and significant sleep apnea. We propose that significant weight loss, following surgery, may indeed be the best therapy for those with these combined problems, and that weight loss may have additional benefits for other common problems related to obesity, including high blood pressure, poor body image and impaired quality of life. Forty appropriate patients who suffer these combined problems will be randomly allocated to either conventional therapy for their sleep apnea and weight problems or to a similar program that includes placement of a Lap-Band, a minimially invasive form of obesity surgery. We will follow the patients for 2-years and serially measure a broad range of health and quality of life outcomes and compare the effects of each program.

However, glucocorticoids such as betamethasone have a range of potentially deleterious non-pulmonary effects, which include significant alterations in fetal cardiovascular function. This is important because intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses constitute a significant proportion of pregnancies in Australia, are at risk of preterm delivery and are therefore likely to receive maternal betamethasone. From both human observations and animal studies, it is well documented that IUGR fetuses demonstrate a range of cardiovascular adaptations that ensure maintenance of oxygen delivery to vital organs despite reduced placental perfusion. However, in recent clinical and experimental studies we have demonstrated that administration of betamethasone to IUGR fetuses induces changes in fetal blood flow that may be detrimental to the IUGR fetus. Specifically, we believe that glucocorticoids may increase the risk of both cardivascular and cerebral damage in the growth restricted fetus. The significance of these findings and the mechanisms regulating these changes remain unclear but they have clear implications for future clinical management.

These receptors are the most commonly targeted by pharmaceutical companies that wish to alter the responses of cells for therapeutic purposes and almost 2-3 of all drugs currently marketed work through these proteins. This project will examine the mechanisms whereby certain types of G-protein coupled receptor produce signals in cells and determine what are the critical areas of the receptor for these interactions. The receptors involved have been discovered only in the last 4 years and little is known of the ways these change the activity of cells. The substances acting on these receptors have potential for development as targets for drugs that have the potential to treat fibrosis which is a feature of many diseases including cardiac failure, kidney failure and lung disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ross Bathgate","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035287","middle_name":"Ad","last_name":"Bathgate","source_individual_id":"RMIS676878","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Ross Bathgate"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86144","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roger Summers","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016511","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Summers","source_individual_id":"5017774","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Roger Summers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81186","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61244","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A double-blind sham controlled trial of rTMS in treatment resistant major depression","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["clinical trial","depression","transcranial magnetic stimulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436710,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["depression","mental health","treatment resistant depression"],"scientific_title":"A double-blind sham controlled trial of rTMS in treatment resistant major depression","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Fitzgerald","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436710","simplified_title":"rTMS treatment in Major Depression","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"371491.71","source_system":"Treatment Resistant Depression is clearly a major health issue - depression is common, results in marked morbidity and mortality and a large percentage of patients do not respond to, or cannot tolerate standard treatment. The development of new treatments for this condition is undoubtedly required. International efforts are underway to try and establish the efficacy of high frequency left Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (HFL-TMS) to the point where the technique may be approved by regulatory authorities and clinically introduced. However, clearly the response rate to HFL-TMS is suboptimal for its widespread use. The overall goal of this research program is to develop repetitive TMS (rTMS) methods to the point at which they are highly relevant and applicable to clinical practice. None of the substantial international studies is focusing on novel applications such as sequential bilateral rTMS (SBrTMS). The planned outcome of this study is that it may change the focus of rTMS application and practice nationally and internationally. If we can follow our well received initial study of this technique with a substantial comparative trial as planned here, it will provide enough evidence for the more widespread adoption and testing of SBrTMS as a viable alternative to HFL-TMS. Ultimately, this or a modification of it, may become the rTMS administration method of choice. Additionally, we will have a sufficient sample size to start to explore meaningful predictors of clinical response including biological, psychosocial-personality variable predictors."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Fitzgerald","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042400","middle_name":"Bernard","last_name":"Fitzgerald","source_individual_id":"RMIS373905","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Fitzgerald"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87996","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jayashri Kulkarni","data":{"first_name":"Jayashri","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002754","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kulkarni","source_individual_id":"RMIS5890425","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jayashri Kulkarni"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77420","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61243","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cysteine rich secretory proteins (Crisp) are ion channel regulators with essential roles in male fertility","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["calcium channels","ion channels","motility","sperm function testing","spermatogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436705,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["contraception in the male","etiology of defects in sperm function","reproductive biology","reproductive function and fertility control"],"scientific_title":"Cysteine rich secretory proteins (Crisp) are ion channel regulators with essential roles in male fertility","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Moira O'Bryan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436705","simplified_title":"Crisp-1 and -2 function in sperm","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"531696.74","source_system":"Male infertility affects 1 in 20 Australian men and for the majority of other men, contraception is an issue at some point in their lives.

The cysteine rich secretory proteins (Crisps) are a group of proteins which show a remarkable bias to the male reproductive tract. All four are incorporated into sperm. Recently published data from us indicates that they have the ability to regulated calcium flow in sperm and as such sperm activity. The aim of the current proposal is to explore the biological relevance of one domain of Crisp proteins using animal models, in vitro sperm tests and through an analysis of ion flux and phosphorylation status under conditions of altered Crisp-1 and -2 content. The data generated from this project will make a significant contribution to the development of novel male gamete based contraceptives for use by either men or women. In addition, through the attainment of a greater understanding of sperm development and function, we will be able to more precisely define types of infertility, thus allowing for the development of more targeted therapies.

Steroid resistance (need for higher doses) or changes in steroid-sensitivity has been widely recognized in asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Many new drug therapies however have the aim of keeping cortisone use to a minimum because of undesirable side effects like osteoporosis. Annexin-1 is an anti-inflammatory substance important in arthritis development which is also known to mediate many of the actions of steroids. However, the possible contribution of annexin-1 to mediate the effect of steroids in the regulation of these substances has not been examined. Moreover, how annexin-1 turns genes on is not known. Our studies will therefore reveal whether the absence of annexin-1 will increase inflammatory substances turn genes, and secondly, by determining the possible substances regulated by annexin-1 if the treatment with steroids are less effective in the absence of annexin-1. If annexin-1 is found either to increase anti-inflammatory substances or to mediate the effect of therapeutic steroids, its capacity to be involved in the beneficial effect of steroids may have an important impact in treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.

The importance of OA has been acknowledged by its listing within musculoskeletal disease, the 7th health priority in Australia. It is 4 times as common in women as in men.Treatments which slow or prevent OA progressing are limited, so prevention must play a key role. With increasing disease severity, joint cartilage is lost. We have recently developed a method to measure joint cartilage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans which is able to assess the severity of structural changes in the knee. Using this method will allow us to assess 2 issues: 1) Obesity is the only identified modifiable risk factor for knee OA. However, the mechanism is poorly understood. Weight loss programs may be more effective at reducing the risk of OA if they are combined with programs aimed at maintaining muscle mass. 2) Bone is important in development of Knee OA, but its role is poorly understood. Understanding how bone metabolism relates to risk of knee OA may allow us to prevent disease. Bone is more likely to respond to pharmacological manipulation than cartilage. Thus it may prove a more effective target for intervention than cartilage. The Geelong Osteoporosis Study was begun in 1994 to study bone health in Australian women (urban and rural). Much information relevant to the risk of OA has been collected over the past decade. By performing MRI of the knee now and in 2 years time, we will determine the effect of different measures of obesity and bone metabolism on structural change at the knee which predisposes to OA. Since both of these factors (obesity and bone metabolism) are potentially modifiable, this study may offer new avenues of prevention and therapy in knee OA. This has the potential to promote a better quality of life as people age and to reduce the economic burden of knee OA in the community."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Anita Wluka","data":{"first_name":"Anita","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040530","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Wluka","source_individual_id":"RMIS706208","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Anita Wluka"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87501","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julie Pasco","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033078","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Pasco","source_individual_id":"RMIS586865","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julie Pasco"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85571","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Mark Kotowicz","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020177","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Kotowicz","source_individual_id":"RMIS256477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Mark Kotowicz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82152","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Margaret Henry","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002156","middle_name":"Joy","last_name":"Henry","source_individual_id":"RMIS2282034","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Henry"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77262","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61234","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of the Frem proteins in development and disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Cell Adhesion and growth factor signalling","Extracellular matrix","Inherited genetic disease (Fraser Syndrome)","Mouse models of disease","Renal and epidermal development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436659,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Epidermal blistering","Fraser Syndrome","Kidney agenesis and dysplasia","Wound healing"],"scientific_title":"The role of the Frem proteins in development and disease","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

We have identified a family of genes called the Fras and Frem genes and some of these are mutated in a disorder called Fraser Syndrome. Fraser Syndrome patients have profound defects in the normal development of their skin and kidneys. We are studying the function of these genes with a view to understanding not just how Fraser Syndrome develops, but how our organs develop normally. The genes involved in FS contribute to the extracellular matrix which is effectively the scaffolding which our cells use when developing into our organs. The extracellular matrix is also important in maintaining our adult tissues and responding to damage. It can act as a physical support and as a key controller of how ours cells react to growth factors and to each other. This proposal will explore how the Fras and Frem genes mediate these interactions to control normal development and also to determine how their mutation gives rise to disease. In doing so we hope to gain insights into more common diseases which affect both the kidney and the skin."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ian Smyth","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0022213","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Smyth","source_individual_id":"5017633","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Ian Smyth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82732","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61233","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Bioinformatics","Protease","Protein Folding","Protein Structure","Serpin"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436656,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Ashley Buckle","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436656","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"559560.3","source_system":"I am a protein crystallographer determining the structures of medically important proteins such as proteases.

In the adult, CREATINE is obtained either from the diet (after absorption from the gut), or after synthesis in, and release from the liver. We do not know how fetal tissues obtain CREATINE, but we do know that when CREATINE is too low the fetus is likely to die, and that if extra CREATINE is supplied in the mother's diet the fetus is more likely to survive profound asphyxia at birth. In this project, in pregnant animals we will determine if fetal tissues can synthesize and take up CREATINE, and if providing extra CREATINE in the maternal diet throughout pregnancy can protect the heart, brain and breathing apparatus from the damaging effects of asphyxia or low oxygen (hypoxia).

Despite significant improvements in the treatment of these pre-term babies there remains a high incidence of kidney failure. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron and they are formed in the kidney late in pregnancy at a time when many preterm babies are already delivered. Hence, it is important to determine what is the effect of preterm birth on the formation of nephrons. We have shown that the baboon is an excellent model of kidney development in humans. Like humans, we can prematurely deliver baboons and maintain them in a neonatal intensive care unit after birth. In this model, we have evidence to suggest that the formation of the the nephrons within the kidneys of the pre-term infants is impaired and we predict that this leads to impaired kidney function after birth and to susceptibility for renal disease in adulthood. In this study, we will examine kidney function in preterm baboon and human babies and also undertake studies in autopsied kidneys from baboon and human pre-term infants. We will determine whether the number and the cellular structure of the nephrons is affected by preterm delivery and if so, whether kidney function is affected. By comprehensively examining the medical records of the mother and babies, we also aim to identify factors in the care of the mother prior to birth, or of the baby after birth which may link to impaired nephron formation and kidney dysfunction in the baby. We will also determine whether administration of retinoic acid to the baboon preterm baby soon after birth can stimulate the formation of nephrons. The findings of this study will provide important new insights into the mechanisms of kidne failure in preterm babies and will identify potential strategies to prevent nephron loss and enhance nephron formation in preterm infants, which will in turn have long-term implications to kidney health."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jacqueline Coalson","data":{"first_name":"Jacqueline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041677","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Coalson","source_individual_id":"RMIS4332555","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jacqueline Coalson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87813","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lynette Moore","data":{"first_name":"Lynette","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020960","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moore","source_individual_id":"RMIS4332558","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lynette Moore"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82369","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Mary Black","data":{"first_name":"Mary","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006117","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Black","source_individual_id":"RMIS5854","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Mary Black"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mildred Stahlman","data":{"first_name":"Mildred","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004789","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Stahlman","source_individual_id":"RMIS4332561","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mildred Stahlman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77999","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Bertram","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000365","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Bertram","source_individual_id":"5011614","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Bertram"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76752","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61229","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional biology of large serine recombinases from mobile antibiotic resistance elements","data":{"media_summary":"nosocomial infections","end_year":2009,"keywords":["X-ray crystallography","molecular microbiology","multiple-resistant staphylococci","protein-protein interaction","pseudomembraneous colitis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436639,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["antibiotic resistance","hospital morbidity","infectious disease","intenstinal diseases","nosocomial infections"],"scientific_title":"Functional biology of large serine recombinases from mobile antibiotic resistance elements","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Matthew Wilce","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436639","simplified_title":"Understanding the mechanism of the transfer of antibiotic resistance in bacteria","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"436328.39","source_system":"In recent years there has been increasing concern about the emergence of multiply antibiotic resistant strains of many common bacterial pathogens. The development of multiple resistance phenotypes has already led to compromises in the ability to successfully treat infected patients and to increased treatment costs. The emergence of these resistant bacteria is the result of excessive or inappropriate use of antibiotics and the ability of antibiotic resistance genes to be transferred from resistant to susceptible bacteria, either within or between bacterial species. The movement of resistance elements that are integrated into the bacterial genome often involves their excision from their existing site and their subsequent integration into another site in the same or a different genome. This project centres on the analysis of this process in resistant bacteria that cause major disease problems in our hospitals. The research project will focus on MRSA (Multiply Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) which has been a serious problem in our hospitals for many years, and Clostridium difficile, an emerging pathogen of increasing importance and which causes a very serious and chronic form of colitis in hospital patients. By studying the biochemical processes by which enzymes called recombinases excise and subsequently integrate antibiotic resistance elements from these bacteria and by determining the three dimensional structure of such enzymes we aim to determine the mechanism of action of members of this important enzyme family. The major outcomes of the project will be an increased understanding of one of the major processes by which antibiotic resistance determinants can spread both within and between bacterial pathogens of importance in the hospital environment. These studies will contribute towards the development of improved methods for controlling the spread of resistant pathogens and resistance genes in the hospital environment, with concomitant benefits to human health."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Dena Lyras","data":{"first_name":"Dena","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038197","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lyras","source_individual_id":"5016113","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Dena Lyras"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86900","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Matthew Wilce","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034708","middle_name":"Charles James","last_name":"Wilce","source_individual_id":"RMIS182462","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Matthew Wilce"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85991","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julian Rood","data":{"first_name":"Julian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004318","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Rood","source_individual_id":"RMIS46068","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julian Rood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77872","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61228","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of PIPP in cell polarization and proliferation.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cancer","gene knock-out","membrane signalling","nerve outgrowth","phosphoinositide 3-kinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436638,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["breast cancer","cancer","cancer biology","mechanisms of growth invasion and metastasis"],"scientific_title":"The role of PIPP in cell polarization and proliferation.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436638","simplified_title":"Analysis of a signal regulating enzyme.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"533828.39","source_system":"Normally cells only divide when they receive a stimulus such as from a hormone or growth factor. Upon stimulation, a series of signals are generated inside the cell which lead to cell division and development. One of the signaling pathways which responds to growth factor stimulation is the PI3-kinase pathway. This pathway has been implicated in many different human cancers which occur when cells divide uncontrollably and invade into the surrounding tissues. Following growth factor stimulation, PI3-kinase generates a molecule known as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which leads to the activation of many proteins in the signaling pathway. All cells which have PI3-kinase also have enzymes which act to switch off the signals generated by PI3-kinase and thus may play a role in preventing cancer and regulating cell development. We have identified a new enzyme known as PIPP and have shown that it acts to switch off the signals generated by PI3-kinase. We plan to investigate the role of PIPP by increasing or decreasing the amount of PIPP in cells and analysing the effects on cell growth and development. We have also identified a number of proteins which bind to PIPP and we will investigate the role these proteins play in regulating cell signaling. In addition, we plan to characterize the function of PIPP in a whole animal by generating mice which lack PIPP (knockout mice) and assessing the effects on development and cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61227","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Characterization of the FHL protein family","data":{"media_summary":"skeletal muscle","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cell differentiation","gene knockout","muscle","nuclear-cytoplasmic transport","transcriptional regulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436637,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["hypertrophy","muscle atrophy","muscle development","musculoskeletal","skeletal muscle"],"scientific_title":"Characterization of the FHL protein family","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurosciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436637","simplified_title":"Proteins that regulate muscle function","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"517960.05","source_system":"Skeletal muscle responds to exercise or mechanical load, in a process known as hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is initiated by a population of immature muscle cells known as myoblasts which fuse to form myotubes, and then mature to form muscle fibers (differentiation). Many proteins involved in a cascade of activation and-or deactivation are important for regulating hypertrophy (hypertrophic signaling). Failure of skeletal muscle to induce hypertrophy can lead to muscle degeneration. The FHL proteins are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. FHL proteins are molecular scaffolds which direct assembly of protein complexes to form the muscle contraction machinery (sarcomere). We propose FHL proteins will initiate-regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Increased levels of FHL1 correlate with skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, it is unclear if increased FHL1 is alone sufficient to induce hypertrophy directly. We have genetically engineered mice to express elevated levels of FHL1 specifically in skeletal muscles (FHL1 transgenic mice) and these mice show muscle enlargement. FHL1 transgenic mice have larger muscle fibers and are >7-fold stronger than non-transgenic littermates. We are currently examining which cell signaling pathways are affected by elevated FHL1. We are also investigating the role of another family member FHL3 in the differentiation of immature myoblasts, a process essential for both embryonic and postnatal skeletal muscle (hypertrophy) development. In the cell nucleus, FHL2 regulates genes which control cell growth and death and increased nuclear levels of FHL2 been detected in prostate cancer biopsies. Recently we demonstrated that FHL2 binds and is sequestered from the nucleus, by a protein, filamin. We are investigating the FHL2-mediated regulation of genes in human melanoma cells, which due to gene mutation are devoid of filamin and will determine how this affects FHL2 function in muscle."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Edna Hardeman","data":{"first_name":"Edna","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007725","middle_name":"Christine","last_name":"Hardeman","source_individual_id":"5015078","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Edna Hardeman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78790","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61226","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of the 72 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase in cellular function.","data":{"media_summary":"macrophage activation","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cancer","gene knockout","macrophage","membrane signaling","phosphoinositide 3-kinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436636,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["cancer mechanisms of growth","cell signaling","cell survival","invasion and metastasis","macrophage activation"],"scientific_title":"The role of the 72 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase in cellular function.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436636","simplified_title":"Analysis of a new signaling enzyme.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"549196.74","source_system":"Cells respond to external signals and the environment to undergo cell growth, secretion and-or other specialized functions including control of cell death and-or cell size.

Two of the PI3-kinase signals have been demonstrated to regulate the activity of an oncogene involved in breast and ovarian cancer. We aim to determine the specific role each of these PI3-kinase signals plays in the activation of the oncogene. In addition the levels of the 72kDa enzyme is altered in some cervical and lymphoma cancers. We will image live cells containing specific fluorescent probes under different conditions and study the activation and location of these probes in order to understand how different PI3-kinase signals are regulated in time and space. In addition to regulating signals that are involved in cancer, PI3-kinase controls signals that are important for proper immune function. Phagocytosis is a biological process where specialised immune cells (macrophages) take up and remove harmful particles such as bacteria or tumour cells from the circulation. This process depends on PI3-kinase and the signals it produces. We will determine whether the 72 kDa enzyme, which is expressed in macrophages, plays a role in regulating these signals during phagocytosis. We have shown that the 72 kDa enzyme can interact with several different proteins which may affect its location and activity within the cell. We will examine the effect of these interactions on the PI3-kinase signals which are involved in cell survival and immune responses.

The organ destruction follows from recognition by the immune system of specific molecules in these organs. These autoimmune diseases are incurable and controlled mainly by long-term administration of substances that suppress the immune system, often with serious side-effects. A rational approach is to render the rogue immune system harmless by removing the cells that recognize these particular molecules. This can be achieved by a Trojan horse approach in which the molecules are delivered to the immune system such that that the immune cells that recognize them are removed. To deliver these molecules to the immune system we will genetically engineer bone marrow stem cells, or embryonic stem cells that generate these stem cells, because they are precursors of mature immune cells. Rejection of organ transplants arise in a similar way and also require long-term immunosuppression. A similar approach can therefore be taken to promote acceptance of foreign organ grafts. In the aged, we will combine these approaches with rejuvenation of the immune system by blockade of sex steroid production and-or by creation of a new immune organ."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Claude Bernard","data":{"first_name":"Claude","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029436","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Bernard","source_individual_id":"RMIS118720","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Claude Bernard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84631","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Boyd","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017852","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Boyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS8290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Boyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81554","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Edouard Stanley","data":{"first_name":"Edouard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016393","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Stanley","source_individual_id":"5017676","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Edouard Stanley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81153","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ban-Hock Toh","data":{"first_name":"Ban-Hock","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010681","middle_name":"","last_name":"Toh","source_individual_id":"5017936","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ban-Hock Toh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79599","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Trounson","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005102","middle_name":"O","last_name":"Trounson","source_individual_id":"RMIS72728","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alan Trounson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78089","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61224","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Antiviral immunity, Innate immunity","Bioinformatics","Protein structure, X-ray crystallography","hornone-dependant cancer, human breast cancer","mRNA expression, RNA binding proteins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436631,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Matthew Wilce","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436631","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"749274.94","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Matthew Wilce","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034708","middle_name":"Charles James","last_name":"Wilce","source_individual_id":"RMIS182462","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Matthew Wilce"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85991","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61223","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Practitioner Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Clinical Trial; clinical trials","Intensive care; Intensive care medicine","Thrombosis; Embolism and Thormbosis","traumatic brain injury; brain injury"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436629,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Practitioner Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Intensive Care","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Cooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436629","simplified_title":"Practitioner Fellowship","sub_type":"Practitioner Fellowship","total_budget":"360312.91","source_system":"I am an intensive care physician, clinician and researcher, interested in studying new therapies to improve outcomes in patienst with acute trauma, sepsis and lung injury.

The aim of this project is to investigate the way in which the multiple visual areas of the brain develop and become 'wired' together in the period following birth. We will also determine if there are mechanisms which allow alternate routes to be found for processing visual information while the brain is still establishing connections between its multiple areas.

Specifically we aim to build a prototype and test the device in a relevant animal model of CHF. Chronic heart failure is a major public health problem affecting >10% of the adult population over the age of 60 years. It is associated with high morbidity, mortality, frequent hospitalisation and major cost burden on the public health system. Weak heart muscle results in poor delivery of blood to the kidneys. Poor delivery to the kidneys activates circulating hormones which in turn further impair cardiac function by adverse effects on the heart. We have developed and patented a novel catheter based system for improvement of renal function via a purpose built device. Proof-of-concept studies have shown that the device should improve kidney blood flow in the setting of CHF. Given the huge public health problem of heart failure and the importance of the kidney in this setting, the commercial potential for a simple device that can be positioned via a catheter-based approach, permanently implanted is large. The device is currently being constructed by the Monash University Department of Engineering where expertise exists with regard to biomedical devices and materials engineering. A series of proof-of-concept studies will then be performed in sheep, as the vasculature of the sheep roughly approximates the dimensions of man. Sheep with CHF will have the device inserted percutaneously into the aorta. Measurements will be made of renal artery flow, relevant circulatory hormones and ultrasound of the heart at baseline (pre-deployment) and following deployment. We believe the above studies (should they be successful) will be sufficient to constitute definitive proof-of-concept and thus allow the device to be commercialised, most likely by a licensing arrangement with a device company."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Friend","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042496","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Friend","source_individual_id":"RMIS4293952","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Friend"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88024","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Henry Krum","data":{"first_name":"Henry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037854","middle_name":"","last_name":"Krum","source_individual_id":"5011241","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Henry Krum"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86810","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Hunyor","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031455","middle_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"Hunyor","source_individual_id":"5015390","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Hunyor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85142","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61219","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The tumour cell-specific nuclear targeting properties of chicken anaemia virus VP-3: potential for anti-tumour therapy","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Apoptosis","Nuclear targeting signals/nuclear transport machinery","Protein Engineering","Tumour cells","Viral Proteins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436614,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Anti-cancer therapies","Apoptosis","Cancer/tumourogenesis","Gene therapy"],"scientific_title":"The tumour cell-specific nuclear targeting properties of chicken anaemia virus VP-3: potential for anti-tumour therapy","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Jans","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436614","simplified_title":"Tumor cell-specific targeting","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"465210.05","source_system":"Current trends indicate that cancer will cause 40% of all deaths in Australia by 2012, meaning that new anti-cancer strategies are urgently required.

Using various strategies, we have identified part of the apoptin molecule that confers efficient localisation in the nucleus of tumour cells, but not non-tumour cells. Our experimental program intends to define this tumour cell-specific targeting signal in detail, and determine the molecular basis of the differential subcellular localisation of apoptin in tumour compared to normal cells. This should contribute fundamental new information regarding the differences between cancer and normal cells. Additionally, we intend to optimise the targeting signal and perform initial experiments to test its efficacy in targeting anti-tumour drugs to the nucleus of tumour cells.

By the age of 3, virtually every child has been infected by RSV at least once. RSV is also an important cause of pneumonia in the elderly and is estimated to cause more deaths each winter than influenza. In Australia, an estimated 100,000 infants are infected by RSV every year. In Victoria, RSV is the most common cause of all reported cases of respiratory tract disease, with an estimated annual cost of $1-4 million. Despite more than 40 years of research there is no vaccine to prevent RSV infection, and the only drug (ribavirin) licenced for treatment of RSV infection is expensive, difficult to administer, toxic, and of doubtful efficacy. We propose to examine one of the RSV proteins, the matrix protein (M). M is very important for virus propagation and is responsible for resultant cell injury. We have observed that M enters the cell nucleus (the location for all cellular DNA and RNA synthesis) where it appears to inhibit host cell RNA synthesis early in infection; later, it exits the nucleus in a step required for virus production in the cytoplasm. The signals that regulate transport of M into and out of the nucleus and the effect on the host cell leading to pathogenesis, are the focus of this proposal. The results of this study will be beneficial in many ways. Most importantly, we will gain knowledge about the processes underlying cell injury caused in RSV disease, which may lead to the identification of novel targets for intervention strategies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Jans","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Bardin","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000227","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Bardin","source_individual_id":"5019436","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philip Bardin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76719","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61217","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Motor functioning in autism and Asperger's disorder: Furthering current neurobehavioural and clinical definitions","data":{"media_summary":"Psychiatric disorders","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Autism","Differential diagnosis","Intellectual disability","Movement disorders","Psychiatric disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436609,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Autism spectrum disorders","Developmental disorders","Intellectual disability in infancy and childhood","Movement disorder","Psychiatric disorders"],"scientific_title":"Motor functioning in autism and Asperger's disorder: Furthering current neurobehavioural and clinical definitions","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Nicole Rinehart","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436609","simplified_title":"Motor functioning in autism and Asperger's disorder: Furthering current neurobehavioural and clinical definitions","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"354932.1","source_system":"While it is well known that autism and Asperger's disorder are associated with social, communicative, and behavioural symptoms, it is less well known that affected individuals also have considerable movement and coordination difficulties.

These skills are very important for success at school; for example, if children are unable to participate in school sports they often feel isolated and rejected from the peer group. Also, hand writing problems have a significant impact on children's academic performance. Our previous research has suggested that there may be particular patterns of motor problems that characterise individuals with autism and Asperger's disorder. Our proposed research aims to use the kinds of 3D motion analysis technology used in the movie industry to capture exactly how people affected by these conditions move and respond to the environment. This study will enable us to highlight particular parts of the brain-motor circuitry that are affected by these disorders and will also enable us to more clearly distinguish how autism is different from Asperger's disorder.

This will also lead to the discovery of toxins with potentially novel targets and modes of action and increase our understanding of proposed treatments and prevention of stings."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Graham Nicholson","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032868","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Nicholson","source_individual_id":"RMIS2448569","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Graham Nicholson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85514","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jamie Seymour","data":{"first_name":"Jamie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016158","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Seymour","source_individual_id":"RMIS1746246","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jamie Seymour"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81079","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Hodgson","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013687","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Hodgson","source_individual_id":"RMIS225886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Hodgson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80390","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Geoffrey Isbister","data":{"first_name":"Geoffrey","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002376","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Isbister","source_individual_id":"5015442","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Geoffrey Isbister"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77313","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61213","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in cell cycle checkpoint responses","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["DNA replication","cell cycle","cell division","protein tyrosine kinase","protein tyrosine phosphatase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436602,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["cancer","cell cycle regulation","cell signalling","tumourigenesis"],"scientific_title":"Tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in cell cycle checkpoint responses","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Tony Tiganis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436602","simplified_title":"Tyrosine phosphorylation and the cell cycle","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"513946.74","source_system":"In order for an organism to grow and develop, the cells that make up the tissues and organs need to undergo a process of cellular division, wherein individual cells grow and then divide into two cells. During this process of cellular growth and division the entire genome needs to be duplicated (this occurs during S-phase) and then divided equally into the two daughter cells. In S-phase several so-called 'checkpoint' mechanisms exist which ensure that this occurs in an orderly and precise manner. The so-called 'DNA replication checkpoint' delays S-phase progression in response to 'replication stresses' that may otherwise cause DNA damage. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are hyperactivated in many human solid tumours and blood malignancies contributing to varied aspects of tumour progression. Our preliminary studies indicate that the inactivation of PTKs by protein tyrosine phosphatases may be essential for the suppression of S-phase progression in response to replication stress. Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which PTKs and tyrosine phosphatases contribute to S-phase checkpoints. Our studies will provide important insights into DNA replication stress-induced checkpoint responses in mammals and identify unprecedented mechanisms by which hyperactivated PTKs may contribute to tumour development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Tony Tiganis","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005041","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tiganis","source_individual_id":"RMIS5662","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Tony Tiganis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78071","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61211","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Endocrinology","Macrophage","Male reproduction","Reproductive immunology","Testis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436601,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Mark Hedger","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436601","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"618721.82","source_system":"I am a reproductive biologist studying the hormonal and immunological regulation of male reproductive function."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Mark Hedger","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013601","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Hedger","source_individual_id":"5015185","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Mark Hedger"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80368","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61210","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A proteomic approach to identify regulations of haemopoeitic stem cell self-renewal","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Haematopeisis","Proteomics","Self-renewal","Stem cells","translational"],"nhmrc_grant_id":435103,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"A proteomic approach to identify regulations of haemopoeitic stem cell self-renewal","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Stephen Ting","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/435103","simplified_title":"A proteomic approach to identify regulations of haemopoeitic stem cell self-renewal","sub_type":"CJ Martin Biomedical ECF","total_budget":"383672.72","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Stephen Ting","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005046","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ting","source_individual_id":"5022908","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Stephen Ting"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78073","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61188","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Signalling networks as targets for antibody therapy in glioma.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["antibody therapy","cell signalling","epidermal growth factor receptor","glioma","tyrosine kinase receptors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433615,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["EGF/EGFR signalling","antibody cancer therapy","glioblastoma"],"scientific_title":"Signalling networks as targets for antibody therapy in glioma.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Terrance Johns","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433615","simplified_title":"Development of novel therapies for brain tumor.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"526683.42","source_system":"Antibodies are a major component of the bodies immune system that bind (i.e. stick) to foreign substances such as viruses. Once bound, these antibodies can activate other parts of the immune system, which help destroy the foreign substance. Analogous to the situation above, a number of institutions are testing antibodies that bind to cancer cells, in order to determine if they are able to destroy these cells. It is also possible to generate antibodies that bind to receptors on the surface of cancer cells and block their function. If you target a receptor critical to the growth or survival of a cancer cell in this way, then swtiching-off this signal may inhibit tumor growth. In this proposal we plan to test a panel antibodies that recognize receptors important to the growth of brain cancer. Two of these antibodies have been generated and the other two will be made as part of this proposal. A key aspect of this proposal will be testing these antibodies in combination to determine how many receptors need to be targeted in order to get complete tumor regressions in animal models. Overall this work will help us identify new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain cancer. Finally, we will also analyze the way different receptors interact together in brain cancer cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Terrance Johns","data":{"first_name":"Terrance","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025783","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Johns","source_individual_id":"5015529","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Terrance Johns"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83643","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61151","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Nursing in general practice: designing & implementing an applied model of research & development.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["action research","community profile","consumer","general practice","nursing"],"nhmrc_grant_id":431532,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Nursing in general practice: designing & implementing an applied model of research & development.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Nursing: Primary (Preventative)","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NURSING","cia_name":"Mrs Jane Mills","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/431532","simplified_title":"Nursing in general practice: designing & implementing an applied model of research & development.","sub_type":"General Practice ECF","total_budget":"191687.5","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jane Mills","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003416","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Mills","source_individual_id":"RMIS4727799","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Jane Mills"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77611","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61129","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular and cellular studies of the adaptive immune response in health and disease","data":{"media_summary":"immune responses","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Inflammation","autoimmune diseases","cytokines and chemokines","immunlogical tolerance","immunorgulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":427620,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Autoimmune initiation","Autoimmunity","Immune dysfunction","Inflammation and inflammatory joint disease","immune responses"],"scientific_title":"Molecular and cellular studies of the adaptive immune response in health and disease","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Charles Mackay","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/427620","simplified_title":"Adaptive immune responses","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"16509154.09","source_system":"Immune responses protect us against pathogens such as viruses and bacteria.

We plan to do this using state-of-of-the-art technologies, including genetically modified mice, gene microarrays, monoclonal antibodies, and flow cytometry. We have brought together Australia's leading immunologists with complimentary expertise and research interests in specific areas of immunology including cytokines, cell migration, inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity and cell-cell interactions. One aspect of the application is to understand the genetic and molecular basis of immunological diseases. However we also wish to move on from an understanding to treatment of immunological diseases through the development of novel therapeutics.

The capacity of some stem cells to self-renew and under specific conditions, give rise to all adult cell types, a property known as pluripotency , is the key to unlocking the potential of cell based therapies. The development of stem cell based therapies promises to revolutionize the treatment of many common human diseases. For instance, in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsons disease, normal embryonic stem cells grown in culture could be used to replace the lost or disabled neurons in the patient. Many other conditions including diabetes, cystic fibrosis, myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke could potentially be treated with stem cell based therapies. Understanding the molecular regulators that govern establishment and maintenance in culture of stem cell lines derived from embryos and from germ cells is the primary goal of this study. We will use well-established techniques to genetically manipulate mouse embryonic stem cells and embryos to examine the role of a specific gene, NANOG. Named after the Celtic legend of Tir NaNog (land of the ever young). When NANOG was forced to remain active, embryonic stem cells were able to grow in media deficient in factors usually required for self-renewal and did not lose their pluripotency even when treated with chemical agents that usually induce differentiation. Understanding the full capacity of NANOG to influence stem cell self-renewal and elucidation of the underlying molecular pathways regulated by this gene will provide valuable insights into the establishment and manipulation of stem cell lines from embryonic and adult tissues."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Adam Hart","data":{"first_name":"Adam","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031160","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Hart","source_individual_id":"5015103","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Adam Hart"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85074","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60822","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Endothelial Cell-Leukocyte Interactions: Atomic Force Microscopy Studies","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["AGEs","Cellular Adhesion","Diabetes","Inflammation","Vascular Disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401123,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Endothelial Cell-Leukocyte Interactions: Atomic Force Microscopy Studies","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Stephanie De Dios","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401123","simplified_title":"Endothelial Cell-Leukocyte Interactions: Atomic Force Microscopy Studies","sub_type":"Peter Doherty Biomedical ECF","total_budget":"327334.41","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Stephanie De Dios","data":{"first_name":"Stephanie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006903","middle_name":"T","last_name":"De Dios","source_individual_id":"RMIS6045690","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Stephanie De Dios"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78573","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60512","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomised controlled trial of exercise programs for preventing knee injuries","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Biomechanics","Injury prevention","Intevention study","Randomised controlled trial","Sports injury"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400937,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Accidental injury","Knee injury","Preventable injury","Sports injury"],"scientific_title":"A randomised controlled trial of exercise programs for preventing knee injuries","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Finch","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400937","simplified_title":"Can exercise programs prevent knee injuries?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"1160491.69","source_system":"The promotion of physical activity, either through organised sport or active recreation, is a key public health strategy in this country. However, there is a risk of injury during this participation and efforts need to be undertaken to reduce this risk so that spor is safe for all. Sports injury prevention efforts to date in Australia have been severely hampered by a lack of evidence supporting currently advocated countermeasures. This concern has been recognised by both the NHMRC and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. It is imperative that we formally evaluate the effectiveness of sports injury countermeasures in the context of broad community level participation in sport, in contrast to previous research focussed on professional sport, and begin to deliver the preventive measures to the community. Australian football is a popular sport throughout Australia and it is associated with more medically-treated injuries than any other sport. Knee injuries are particularly common and can have severe consequences. One of the most commonly recommended knee injury prevention strategies is a well-designed exercise training program. Despite their potential to significantly reduce injury rates, the effectiveness of exercise training programs to prevent knee injuries in football, and indeed in most other sports, has not previously been assessed but has been identified as a priority research area by the NHMRC. This project will determine the effectiveness of exercise training programs for preventing knee injuries in community-level football players by monitoring injury rates, player behaviours and player attitudes before and after the training programs are implemented."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Caroline

At present it is the most common cancer, approximately 1 in 21 Australians will develop the disease in his-her lifetime. The risk of bowel cancer increases with age, with the risk rising progressively and sharply from the age of 50. Current therapies for advanced colorectal cancer are not very effective. Mortality from colorectal cancer is high, being second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death in Australia. The development of colorectal cancer is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Colorectal cancer progresses through a number of distinct pathological stages. This is thought to be the result of the progressive aquisition of mutations in genes that normally ensure a balance between cell growth and cell death. Mutations in a gene known as APC are associated with the very early stages of tumour formation in at least 80% of colorectal tumours. Our research is aimed at understanding how alterations in APC influence the behaviour and growth of colonic cells. We have developed a novel system where normal mouse colon can be maintained and grown for up to 2 weeks in a Petri dish. Alterations in the APC gene and other colon cancer genes will be introduced into the normal epithelial cell lining and the effects on the growth and behaviour of the cells in organ culture will be analysed. Our hypothesis is that changes in the APC gene affects the way cells migrate, divide and move. This work should improve our knowledge of the cellular changes that occur during tumour initiation in the bowel and aims to contribute to the design of new therapies for early intervention in colon cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Helen Abud","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017358","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Abud","source_individual_id":"5013115","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Helen Abud"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81420","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60409","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Allosteric regulation of G protein-coupled receptors","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["G protein-coupled receptors","Molecular pharmacology","Muscarinic receptors","Neuromodulation","Signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400134,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Dementia","Pain","Parkinson's Disease","Schizophrenia"],"scientific_title":"Allosteric regulation of G protein-coupled receptors","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Arthur Christopoulos","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400134","simplified_title":"G protein-coupled receptor allosterism","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"509017.61","source_system":"The normal function of all living cells depends on how they respond to the multitude of physical and chemical stimuli to which they are constantly exposed.

To date, the majority of drugs acting at GPCRs do so by binding to specific regions on these receptors. Although many breakthroughs in disease treatment have been achieved using this approach, there remain a number of acknowledged limitations, including lack of drug selectivity, toxicity and reduced responsiveness with prolonged therapy. Our current proposal focuses on targeting drugs to alternative regions of GPCRs that may overcome many of the limitations associated with current drug therapies.

family and other gendered relations are an important and understudied aspect of alcohol studies, with general social and policy implications. The proposed research will make an important contribution to developing quantitative research in this area in Australia. The project uses concepts and measures which are novel in an Australian environment, and the international comparative aspect of the project, with comparable questionnaires in a wide diversity of societies, is novel and innovative for the alcohol research field in general. Measures of social problems from drinking, and particularly and family and relationship, developed in analysing the study material will be made more broadly available for use in future studies, raising the possibility that the study may serve as a first measurement point for future data-series over time."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Loretta Vaughan","data":{"first_name":"Loretta","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0040220","middle_name":"","last_name":"Vaughan","source_individual_id":"RMIS3770323","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Loretta Vaughan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87419","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Damien Jolley","data":{"first_name":"Damien","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037587","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Jolley","source_individual_id":"5015537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Damien Jolley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86736","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michael Ackland","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035000","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Ackland","source_individual_id":"RMIS225059","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michael Ackland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86074","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Dietze","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024526","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Dietze","source_individual_id":"5012173","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Paul Dietze"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83293","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robin Room","data":{"first_name":"Robin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021803","middle_name":"G.

We have discovered a specific mutation in a gene for a receptor molecule called gp130 that results in the formation of stomach cancer in mice. Strikingly, mice with this mutation are also highly susceptible to clinically-relevant experimental models of septic shock and peritonitis, two chronic inflammatory disorders induced by bacterial infection. We are now aiming to understand the exact molecular events by which this mutation results in the uncontrolled growth of epithelial cells that line the stomach wall, as well as uncontrolled regulation of the immune system leading to local and systemic inflammation. At the molecular level, the mutation in gp130 leads to over-activation of two signalling molecules, Stat1 and Stat3, which are also used by a range of other receptors to transmit specific cellular responses. In the context of cancer and inflammation, Stat1 and Stat3 have opposing roles (ie Stat3 promotes cancer and can be both anti-pro-inflammatory, while Stat1 suppresses cancer and is pro-inflammatory), although as yet, the contribution of the gp130 receptor in directing Stat1 and Stat3 activation in these disorders is not known. Our proposal employs established strategies and unique mouse models to specifically address how the mutation in gp130 can orchestrate the opposing biological functions of these two molecules to drive stomach cancer and inflammation. The identification of mechanisms by which gp130-dependent activation of these two molecules causally relate to inflammation and stomach cancer will ultimately provide novel and rational approaches to target these molecules for the screening and treatment of various inflammatory disorders and cancers, including those of the stomach."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Hertzog","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013632","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hertzog","source_individual_id":"RMIS8318","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Hertzog"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80373","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brendan Jenkins","data":{"first_name":"Brendan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008163","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Jenkins","source_individual_id":"5015495","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Brendan Jenkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78905","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60136","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Function of a novel interferon in reproductiona and development","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Cytokine Signalling","Gene Expression","Interferon (tau)","Maintaining Pregnancy","Reproduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384261,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Fertility","Maintaining Pregnancy","Reproduction","Uterine and fetal infection"],"scientific_title":"Function of a novel interferon in reproductiona and development","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Hertzog","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384261","simplified_title":"Study of a new interferon protein that maintains pregnancy and prevents infection","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"507270.54","source_system":"It is important to understand the factors responsible for maintaining fertility, pregnancy and to prevent infection of the developing fetus and the uterus.

Underlying the function of both blood cell types is their ability to stick (or adhere) to each other. However the way in which they coordinate this adhesion is very complex. New information from our laboratory has demonstrated that the sticky behaviour of each cell type is spatially and temporally regulated, and may involve may factors both inside and outside of the cells themselves.

Because they multiply uncontrollably, tumour cells spread into surrounding tissue and can invade other organs of the body. The Ephs and interacting ephrins are proteins on the cell surface, and their communication controls the position of cells within the body tissues and organs, but also in tumours. Together with collaborators at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and the Queensland Institute for Medical Research we produced two proteins, an antibody and a recombinant ephrin that bind one of the Eph proteins on tumour cells. The antibody allowed us to locate Eph in tumours, where it appears surprisingly not only on tumour cells but also on tumour blood vessels. When attached to a redioactive compund it selectively targets the cancer cells and in an animal study prolonged the survival of mice with leukemia significantly. We will now investigate the exact role of this Eph protein in tumour blood vessels. We will then study what happens in tumours when a toxic antibody-drug compound targets this tumour and starts to kill tumour cells. Finally, we will devise a novel reagent that combines the properties of the antibody with the properties of the ephrin into a single protein, which can deliver a cell-killing drug exclusively and most efficiently to tumour cells containing the Eph protein on its surface."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Scott","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039591","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Scott","source_individual_id":"RMIS66624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Scott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87269","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Dimitar Nikolov","data":{"first_name":"Dimitar","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038795","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Nikolov","source_individual_id":"RMIS5240556","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Dimitar Nikolov"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87046","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Boyd","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023731","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Boyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS3609","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Boyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83095","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann","data":{"first_name":"Martin","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020227","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lackmann","source_individual_id":"RMIS7979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82165","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60132","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Therapeutic relevance of AT2 receptors in cardiovascular disease and aging","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["aging","angiotensin II","angiotensin receptors (AT2)","pharmacology","vasodilatation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384237,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["aging","cardiovascular disease","hypertension","hypertrophy"],"scientific_title":"Therapeutic relevance of AT2 receptors in cardiovascular disease and aging","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Robert Widdop","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384237","simplified_title":"Opposing effects of angiotensin in cardiovascular disease and aging","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"519279.35","source_system":"Pharmacological modulation of the renin angiotensin system is a cornerstone of evidence-based cardiovascular therapeutics. However, their molecular mechanisms are not entirely clear and some therapeutic options have not been utilized to their full potential.

Of particular importance to contemporary society is the shift in the demographic to a more aged population. In Australia in 2002, 13% of the population (~2.5 million) were aged 65 years or over, and it has been estimated that this number will increase to 18% (~4 million) by the year 2021. While lipid status and smoking are well known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, advanced age by far confers the greatest risk for cardiovascular disease. In this context, we have found a greater role of the inhibitory angiotensin II binding site in aging that may result from breakdown products of angiotensin II having their own unique effects.

Treatments which slow-prevent OA progressioning are limited and so prevention must play a key role. Obesity is the most significant, potentially modifiable risk factor for knee OA. The combination of the current epidemic of obesity in Western countries and the aging of the population is likely to have a synergistic effect on the prevalence and incidence of knee OA. Despite the consistent relationship between obesity and OA, little work has been done on the relationship between obesity and biomechanical factors such as knee angle and muscle mass and how these may interact with obesity and weight loss in modifying the risk of knee OA. It may be that weight loss programs could be more effective at reducing the risk of OA if they are combined with programs aimed at correcting muscle weakness and malalignment.

Indeed, several common ailments of the upper digestive tract that were once thought to be untreatable, or which could only be treated by radical surgery, are now managed through the use of antibiotics and acid-blocking substances. The efficacy of these treatments has, however, been affected by the increasing rates of H. pylori resistance to these antibiotics in the general community. Furthermore, the limited choice of antibiotics available for use in anti-H. pylori treatment regimens, and the side-effects associated with several of these compounds, suggest that there is a need to develop new therapies against this bacterial infection. This, however, will necessitate a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which H. pylori is able to colonise and survive in the mucus layer covering the stomach. To address this point, we have used a gene profiling technique to compare gene expression in H. pylori bacteria displaying high and low levels of colonisation in a mouse model. For this, mouse-colonising H. pylori bacteria were attenuated through extensive passaging on culture media in the laboratory. Five genes were identified as being poorly expressed in the attenuated bacteria. These genes are proposed to encode putative H. pylori colonisation factors. The aim of the project is to characterise these factors, and to determine the roles of two of these, which are involved in the production of vitamin B6, in the colonisation of the stomach. This work will contribute to a greater understanding of the factors involved in H. pylori colonisation of the stomach.

There are four different classes of recycled water (Class A, B, C and D), depending on the level of microbiological contamination. The potential level of exposure of the population to recycled water determines the class of water suitable for various reuse purposes. The need to address water recycling issues in Australia has resulted in increasing numbers of innovative recycling schemes such as dual reticulation systems which supply two qualities of water to households, one of high quality for drinking and a second piped system delivering treated recycled water for non-potable (non-drinking) use. In this project, we will investigate the safety of using recycled water in different situations by using water with different known concentrations of micro-organisms to simulate recycled waters of different classes. Most state health authorities in Australia do not approve the use of recycled water for machine washing because of a lack of safety data, but its use in laundries could significantly reduce the need for high quality drinking water. We will perform experiments to help determine the safety of using recycled water for rinsing clothes during a washing machine cycle. Another use of recycled water is for irrigation of recreational parks. Because of safety concerns, when recycled water of Class B or C is used, some states advocate that the public must wait at least 4 hours after watering before they can gain access.

Eight years into a drought Australia's water sources are becoming increasingly depleted, so we need to reduce water consumption and consider using alternative sources of water. Increased use of rainwater is one of a number of solutions available. However, current recommendations state that rainwater can be safely used for purposes other than drinking, but because of potential contamination and limited evidence regarding safety, drinking untreated rainwater is not approved by state health departments. The main outcome of this study will be to determine whether drinking untreated water from rainwater tanks poses a significant health risk. Additionally, we will determine if specific tank or maintenance characteristics can be identified that increase illness risk. The study design consists of following the health of 300 families who drink unboiled rainwater. Families will have a special tap installed that draws water through a water treatment unit (WTU). Half the families will have a working WTU and half will have a sham unit identical in appearance. The functional units sterilise water to remove any microorganisms present, while the sham filters have no effect. All participating families will keep a health diary for one year to record how often they suffer gastroenteritis. Neither the families nor the research workers will know which type of filter has been fitted. Water samples will be collected from selected households. At the end of a year the number of illnesses in the two groups will be compared. If those drinking rainwater from a sham filter suffer more often, then rainwater would be implicated as a source of gastroenteritis. This study will provide health authorities with a better understanding of the relationship between rainwater consumption and human health, and will provide data regarding safe uses of this alternative water source."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr David

This study aims to develop simple cotside monitoring procedures that allow neonatologists to monitor oxygen supply and blood flow in the brain in tiny babies who weigh less than 1000gm, and what happens within the brain when drugs are given to raise blood pressure. We will employ a new instrument that generates low intensity near infrared light which passes safely into the brain and is absorbed according to the amount of oxygen present in very small blood vessels. As the methodology is new, we intend to first validate the measurement in immature lambs. The instrument will then be applied in studies of babies undergoing intensive care and at risk for low pressure and brain injury, as many as 5000 babies each year in Australia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rosemary Horne","data":{"first_name":"Rosemary","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013739","middle_name":"Sc","last_name":"Horne","source_individual_id":"RMIS61341","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rosemary Horne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80402","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Charles Barfield","data":{"first_name":"Charles","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011612","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Barfield","source_individual_id":"RMIS3635610","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Charles Barfield"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79854","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Adrian Walker","data":{"first_name":"Adrian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010883","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS59623","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Adrian Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79666","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60124","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomised control trial of medical treatment versus the placement of the Lap Band in severely obese adolescents.","data":{"media_summary":"weight loss","end_year":2008,"keywords":["adolescents","obesity surgery","quality of life","severe obesity","weight loss"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384215,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Obesity related comorbidity","disability","severe obesity in adolescent","surgical outcomes research","weight loss"],"scientific_title":"A randomised control trial of medical treatment versus the placement of the Lap Band in severely obese adolescents.","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr John Dixon","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384215","simplified_title":"Adolescent obesity: Non-surgical management versus surgical management.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"481905.87","source_system":"There has been a substantial rise in the number of overweight and obese adolescents in our community. While prevention of obesity is the ultimate goal, effective stratagies for the management of obese adolescents must be sought. Unfortunately there are few studies that have focused on this problem in adolescents and success has been very limited. Modern obesity surgery is the only reliable method of achieving and sustaining major weight loss in severely obese (body mass index > 35 kg-m2) adults and there are now several small studies that demonstrate its effectiveness in adolescents. Modern obesity surgery involving the keyhole placement of an adjustable band around the very upper part of the stomach has proven to be safe and effective and requires one 24 hr stay in hospital. In this collaborative study, involving the Monash University Centre for Obesity Research and Education and the Royal Children's Hospital, we propose to formally test, for the first time, the effectiveness of a weight loss program that includes adjustable band surgery, and compare this with a comprehensive best care behavioral program, over a period of 2-years in severely obese adolescents. We estimate that suitable subjects will come from the top 1% for body mass index in our community. After thorough assessment 50 suitable candidates with ages ranging from 14 to 18 years will be randomly allocated to one of the two treatment programs. The intensity of each program will be similar. A broad range of measues including: weight, health status, physical disability, psychological status, body image and quality of life, will be performed before and at completion of the 2-year programs. In addition we will compare the complications, compliance and cost of the two programs. This study will help us assess and compare the effectiveness of the 2 programs and provide vital information regarding the role of modern keyhole obesity surgery for the management of severely obese adolescents."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Susan Sawyer","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033651","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Sawyer","source_individual_id":"5017372","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Susan Sawyer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85711","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Dixon","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024544","middle_name":"Bernard","last_name":"Dixon","source_individual_id":"5014345","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Dixon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83297","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Paul O'Brien","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021201","middle_name":"Edmond","last_name":"O'Brien","source_individual_id":"5016771","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"E/Pr Paul O'Brien"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82434","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60123","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A longitudinal study of psychopathology in people with intellectual disability","data":{"media_summary":"Mental Health","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Autism","Epidemiological cohort","Genetic syndromes","Intellectual Disability","Psychopathology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384211,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Autism","Epidemiology","Genetics","Intellectual Disability","Mental Health"],"scientific_title":"A longitudinal study of psychopathology in people with intellectual disability","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384211","simplified_title":"The course of emotional and behavioural problems in young people with intellectual disability","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"999803.26","source_system":"This project will further develop the research opportunities of an internationally unique 15 year follow up study of the mental health of young Australians with ID. We have shown that this group has 2-3 times the risk of suffering serious emotional and behavioural problems that are an added heavy burden on the individual, their family and carers and the community. These problems often are not recognised but are as common as schizophrenia in the community. The study will continue to use a combination of questionnaire survey and in depth interviews of the young adults and their families or carers to track the course of their mental health. The study commenced in 1990 with nearly 1000 young people with ID aged 4-18 years and their progress has been reviewed every 2-3 years in over 75% of the original group. During the next 5 years we plan to follow their mental health during the critical stage of young adult life. During this time there is the greatest risk of mental illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia and the stresses of adjusting to new daily occupations, independent living or residential care and social contact away from the family. We will be able to study the specific emotional and behavioural problems faced by young adults with the main known causes of ID such as Down, Fragile X, Prader Willi and William Syndromes, as well as those who have autism. The great benefit of a long term follow up study is that it allows us to study the links between earlier family environmental, psychological and biological factors and subsequent mental health problems. We can also demonstrate the impact that mental illness in a young person with ID has on the family and parental mental health. The findings have implications for better diagnosis, improved care and management, early intervention and prevention of these common severe and under recognized mental health problems in this disadvantaged group of young Australians and their families and carers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stewart Einfeld","data":{"first_name":"Stewart","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018853","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Einfeld","source_individual_id":"RMIS153721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stewart Einfeld"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81825","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010691","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Tonge","source_individual_id":"RMIS35666","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79601","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Trevor Parmenter","data":{"first_name":"Trevor","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009541","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Parmenter","source_individual_id":"RMIS153726","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Trevor Parmenter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79295","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60122","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Exploring the physiological, morphological and molecular bases of renal developmental programming.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Fetal origins of adult disease","Kidney","Molecular mechanisms","Physiology","Stereology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384207,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Fetal origins of adult disease","Fetal programming","Kidney","Renal development, renal disease and hypertension as adults"],"scientific_title":"Exploring the physiological, morphological and molecular bases of renal developmental programming.","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof John Bertram","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384207","simplified_title":"Exploring the physiological, morphological and molecular bases of renal developmental programming.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"422264.67","source_system":"Suboptimal fetal and neonatal development increases our risk of developing a range of diseases in adulthood. The concept that deleterious events during development can influence adult health is termed 'developmental programming'. Obtaining A Healthy Start to Life is a priority research goal of the Australian Government. The kidneys are particularly susceptible to developmental programming. This is in part because the functional units (nephrons) of the kidneys are all formed before birth in humans. Thus, if fetal development is suboptimal, babies are at risk of being born with a permanent nephron deficit, with functional and disease consequences. We have shown in male rats that the offspring of a maternal low protein diet have fewer nephrons and lower blood pressure than rats fed a normal diet. These rats display a striking sensitivity in adulthood to the feeding of a high salt diet. We will define the physiological and morphological bases of this sensitivity, and repeat these studies in females, as increasing evidence shows significant sex differences in developmental programming. Defining the molecular mechanisms of developmental programming is the greatest challenge for researchers in the field. We have recently completed the most comprehensive analysis to date of gene expression in the developing mouse kidney, and have shown for the first time that the mouse programmes kidney development. We will use the new techniques of genomics and bioinformatics to study the molecular mechanisms of kidney programming. This mechanistic data will provide an excellent hypothesis engine for future studies on the specific roles of these molecular pathways in developmental programming in all mammalian species."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Roger Evans","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018903","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Evans","source_individual_id":"5011298","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Roger Evans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81839","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Karen Moritz","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009221","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moritz","source_individual_id":"RMIS1366054","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Karen Moritz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79207","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sean Grimmond","data":{"first_name":"Sean","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007616","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Grimmond","source_individual_id":"5014956","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Sean Grimmond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78759","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Bertram","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000365","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Bertram","source_individual_id":"5011614","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Bertram"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76752","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60121","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cerebral Circulation in Sleep: Impact of Endothelial Dysfunction","data":{"media_summary":"Sleep, REM","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Apnoea","Blood Flow","Brain","Heart","Sleep"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384205,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Brain injuries","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Newborn Infant","Sleep Apnoea Syndrome","Sleep, REM"],"scientific_title":"Cerebral Circulation in Sleep: Impact of Endothelial Dysfunction","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Physiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Adrian Walker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384205","simplified_title":"Factors causing brain injury in sleep","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"313026.41","source_system":"Prolonged, repetitive episodes of obstructed breathing during sleep (known as obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome or OSA) is a common medical problem that afflicts both children and adults.

Evidence for or against cancer risk with exposure to lead compounds , in particular inorganic lead, will therefore have implications for many Australian and international workers. This is also important for health risk assessment for environmental contamination in the Australian community. In our study we will review the state government archived records of about 8,000 lead workers in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, who took part in lead compound exposure surveys and had blood tests in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, as part of government lead regulations in force at the time. We will then match the details of these workers against the National Cancer and Death registry data to calculate cancer rates. This should involve a sufficient number of workers to enable us to undertake a comprehensive health evaluation of cancer risk and exposure to lead compounds."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Geza Benke","data":{"first_name":"Geza","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029408","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Benke","source_individual_id":"RMIS679633","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Geza Benke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84627","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lin Fritschi","data":{"first_name":"Lin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019091","middle_name":"","last_name":"Fritschi","source_individual_id":"RMIS5938","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Lin Fritschi"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81876","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Malcolm Sim","data":{"first_name":"Malcolm","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016231","middle_name":"Ross","last_name":"Sim","source_individual_id":"5011979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Malcolm Sim"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81097","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60119","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigation of the role and mode of action of mycolactones and other factors in the pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer","data":{"media_summary":"mycobacterial infection","end_year":2008,"keywords":["bacterial pathogen","bacterial virulence factors","genomics","mycobacteria","polyketides"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384197,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Bairnsdale ulcer","Buruli ulcer","Mycobacterium ulcerans","infectious diseases","mycobacterial infection"],"scientific_title":"Investigation of the role and mode of action of mycolactones and other factors in the pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Tim Stinear","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384197","simplified_title":"Establishing how bacterial toxins cause the disease known as Buruli ulcer","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"509267.61","source_system":"Mycobacterium ulcerans is a bacterium that causes a very serious ulcerating skin disease known as Buruli ulcer. The only effective treatment is surgical removal of affected tissue, a process that can leave victims with life-long disabilities. Buruli ulcer has been increasing dramatically in many countries of Central and West Africa for reasons that are not well understood. Cases of Buruli ulcer also occur in the south and north of Australia where the disease is known as Bairnsdale ulcer and Daintree ulcer respectively. M. ulcerans produces an unusual toxin called mycolactone that kills human cells and causes immunosuppression. Mycolactone belongs to a class of compounds that have important pharmaceutical properties and include antibiotic, anti-tumour and immunosuppressive drugs. The aim of this project is to better understand how mycolactone kills cells and causes immunosuppression, and to identify other parts of M. ulcerans that may be required for ulcer formation. We have recently determined the complete DNA sequence of M. ulcerans and so we can now look very closely at how the bacterium causes disease. We will use our knowledge of the mycolactone DNA to genetically engineer modified mycolactones, and by systematically modifying mycolactone and then testing the properties of the modified compounds, we will be able to identify the components of mycolactone that confer its toxic and immunosuppressive properties. We will also test the products from other DNA sequences identified in M. ulcerans for their ability to kill cells or cause other biological effects that may be implicated in causing ulcers. The outcome of this project will be a much needed increase in our understanding of the role of mycolactone and other factors in causing Buruli ulcers. This knowledge will pave the way for developing effective treatments and will also open avenues for exploiting the biological properties of mycolactones in the development of new pharmaceuticals."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Tim Stinear","data":{"first_name":"Tim","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010463","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Stinear","source_individual_id":"5019286","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Tim Stinear"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79544","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60118","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of endometrial angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis","data":{"media_summary":"Women's Health","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Angiogenesis","Breakthrough bleeding","Endometrial cancer","Lymphatics","Uterus"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384195,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Abnormal Uterine bleeding","Antiangiogenic therapy","Endometrial cancer","Reproductive Health","Women's Health"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of endometrial angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Peter Rogers","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384195","simplified_title":"Regulation of uterine blood and lymph vessel growth","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"488273.48","source_system":"Unlike almost all other parts of the adult body, the blood vessels of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) grow and breakdown each month as part of the menstrual cycle.

The overall aim of this research is to understand how growth and regression of these vascular systems are controlled in the endometrium. The information will have immediate relevance to a number of clinical problems in which abnormal changes in the blood and lymph vascular systems are observed (e.g. tumour growth, wound healing). This includes a number of significant problems relevant to women's health. Non-menstrual bleeding (often termed breakthrough bleeding) is one of the most common gynaecological problems suffered by women, and can be particularly worrying as it may be a symptom of more serious diseases such as uterine cancer. Breakthrough bleeding can occur under a wide range of hormonal conditions and is thought to be due, at least in part, to faulty uterine blood vessel growth. Endometrial cancer is another serious disease and is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy of the female reproductive system. When diagnosed early, this cancer responds well to therapy. However, treatment of this disease is much more difficult when an increase in blood vessel growth is observed and the tumours interact with the lymphatic vascular system. An aim of this research is to investigate changes in uterine blood and lymph vessel growth associated with breakthrough bleeding and endometrial cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Rogers","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027657","middle_name":"Adrian","last_name":"Rogers","source_individual_id":"RMIS4546540","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Rogers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84139","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jane Girling","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019227","middle_name":"Eleanor","last_name":"Girling","source_individual_id":"RMIS2995161","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Jane Girling"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81902","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/7009","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel therapeutic strategy against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria","data":{"media_summary":"Multidrug-resistant bacterial infection","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Anti-biofilm and anti-pathogenic effects","Antibacterial pharmacodynamics","Antibiotic combinations","Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria","Pharmacodynamics of resistance"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384194,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Antimicrobial chemotherapy","Diminishing antibiotic theraputic options","Gram-negative bacteria","Infectious diseases","Multidrug-resistant bacterial infection"],"scientific_title":"Novel therapeutic strategy against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Jian Li","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384194","simplified_title":"New therapy for gram-negative superbugs","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"349823.48","source_system":"In the past two decades, there has been a marked decline in discovery and development of new antibiotics while there has been a remarkable increase in resistance to the currently available antibiotics.

Colistin, an old antibiotic that has been used little over the last 40-50 years, has been 'taken off the shelf' and is now being used as a last line of defence to treat people with infections caused by these bacteria. Clearly, doctors and their infected patients will be in an even more precarious position than currently exists if resistance to colistin increases. We have discovered a novel therapeutic strategy that is able to reverse colistin resistance in P. aeruginosa.

The most likely cause of damage to the fetal brain during pregnancy or at birth is global ASPHYXIA, either by itself or in association with other problems of pregnancy such as infection, preterm birth, or fetal growth retardation. In this project we propose that providing extra amounts of the dietary constituent creatine, or of the hormone melatonin, to the pregnant animal in late gestation, will provide NEUROPROTECTION to the developing brain in the face of an asphyxial challenge that otherwise causes damage. We will use pregnant sheep to investigate the effects of asphyxia in utero on the fetal brain using techniques that allow us to monitor metabolic changes within the brain in real time. In addition, we will use the pregnant Spiny Mouse to investigate the effects of birth asphyxia on the postnatal brain structure and behavioral development. We will study groups of animals fed a normal diet, and compare then to animals that receive additional amounts of creatine or melatonin. We expect to determine if either of these treatments have the potential to protect the developing brain from asphyxial damage, and to recommend if similar treatments could be used in pregnant women where the obstetrician suspects the baby's brain is at risk of damage."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Walker","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022785","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"5018162","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82870","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Margie Castillo-Melendez","data":{"first_name":"Margie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000764","middle_name":"","last_name":"Castillo-Melendez","source_individual_id":"5013815","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Margie Castillo-Melendez"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76875","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/7004","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Defining the roles of NADPH oxidases in vascular remodelling and arterial hypertension","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["ageing","endothelial dysfunction","hypertension","reactive oxygen species"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384163,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["aging","cardiovascular","hypertension","oxidative stress"],"scientific_title":"Defining the roles of NADPH oxidases in vascular remodelling and arterial hypertension","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance in the production and removal of toxic molecules called free radicals within the blood vessel wall, is a key player in the initiation and progression of these disorders. In the early stages of hypertension, production of free radicals only just outweighs their removal, resulting in a mild oxidative stress. However, this is enough to trigger a cascade of downstream events leading to activation of other, normally dormant, free radical generating systems. At these excessive levels, free radicals attack the cells of the artery wall leading to blood vessel dysfunction and ultimately cardiovascular disease. A major source of free radicals in the blood vessel wall are a family of enzymes called NADPH oxidases. It is our hypothesis that upregulation of onr of these enzymes in the early stages of hypertension is the initial trigger for many of the downstream effects that ultimately lead to cardiovascular disease. Our group is uniquely poised to test this hypothesis as we are the only laboratory in the world with access to three different strains of genetically modified mice, each lacking one of the three known isoforms of NADPH oxidase. Identification of the specific isoform of NADPH oxidase involved in free radical production in blood vessels is a critical first step in developing drugs that block vascular free radical production and so remove the molecular link between hypertension and major cardiovascular events."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond","data":{"first_name":"Grant","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030471","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Drummond","source_individual_id":"RMIS2457825","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84911","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Widdop","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022976","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Widdop","source_individual_id":"5018294","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Widdop"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82922","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016332","middle_name":"Graeme","last_name":"Sobey","source_individual_id":"5017621","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81135","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Harald Schmidt","data":{"first_name":"Harald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016098","middle_name":"Hhw","last_name":"Schmidt","source_individual_id":"5011184","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Harald Schmidt"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81056","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr Arun Kumar","data":{"first_name":"Arun","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002756","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kumar","source_individual_id":"RMIS3651937","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr Arun Kumar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77421","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/7003","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Lipid rafts, amyloid neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Membrane binding","Neurite outgrowth","Synaptic dysfunction","tau"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384157,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","Amyloidosis","Dementia"],"scientific_title":"Lipid rafts, amyloid neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Neurochemistry","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Small","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384157","simplified_title":"Lipid rafts, amyloid neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"318267.61","source_system":"Alzheimer's disease is the major cause of dementia in the elderly.

The relative activation of the two pathways can dictate whether cells live and proliferate or differentiate or otherwise die in response to TNF, and therefore determine the nature of the immune or inflammatory response. The T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) is known to be important in the immune system and serves as a negative regulator of inflammation. Our preliminary studies have identified TCPTP as a selective regulator of TNF-induced MAPK but not NFkappaB signaling. TCPTP exerts its effects by inactivating Src family kinases (SFK) which are themselves integral to immune and inflammatory responses.

The IR is a protein tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates itself and downstream substrates on tyrosine in response to insulin. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that dephosphorylate the IR and its substrates might be important targets for therapeutic intervention in type 2 diabetes; inhibition of specific PTPs may allow for enhanced insulin-induced signalling to alleviate insulin resistance.

A central intracellular signaling enzyme that initiates lipid messages that promote glucose uptake into the cell and promote cell survival is that generated by the PI3-kinase. This enzyme has increased activity in many cancers, and is also important in diabetes when the enzyme may be suppressed. Our grant proposes to investigate the function of another enzyme called SKIP which acts within the cell to oppose the functions of the PI3-kinase. Several lines of evidence indicate SKIP may be important in both development and cancer. SKIP has been identified as a putative candidate gene for a developmental disorder known as Miller Dieker syndrome. This disease is associated with facial and significant brain abnormalities. In addition the SKIP gene is located on a chromosome that is frequently deleted in breast and colon cancer. SKIP is an enzyme that functions to remove phosphate molecules from PI3-kinase signaling molecules. SKIP has been shown to prevent glucose uptake into the cell by breaking down PI3-kinase signals. We have recently demonstrated SKIP phosphatase activity can be inhibited by binding to another protein called suppressor of death domains (SODD). We plan to investigate the effects this complex has on SKIP enzyme activity, and how this complex plays a role in regulating PI3-kinase signals that promote glucose uptake. Secondly, we plan to investigate the function of SKIP in an intact animal by making mice which lack SKIP(knock out mice). Given SKIP is implicated in a developmental syndrome and insulin signaling, we can delineate the functional significance of SKIP and the molecular pathways regulated by this enzyme."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6996","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["contraception","endocrinology","fertility","genetics","spermatogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384132,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Moira O'Bryan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384132","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"322750","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Moira O'Bryan","data":{"first_name":"Moira","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038845","middle_name":"K","last_name":"O'Bryan","source_individual_id":"5016749","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Moira O'Bryan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87066","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6995","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of platelet adhesion by the GPIbalpha cytoplasmic tail","data":{"media_summary":"thrombosis","end_year":2008,"keywords":["cytoskeleton","haemostasis","platelet adhesion","thrombosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384126,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Biochemistry-protein peptide","blood disorders","cardiovascular disease","haemostasis","thrombosis"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of platelet adhesion by the GPIbalpha cytoplasmic tail","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Berndt","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384126","simplified_title":"Regulation of platelet adhesion by the GPIbalpha cytoplasmic tail","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"516014.67","source_system":"Platelets are small blood cells that play an essential role in the normal blood clotting process that stops bleeding following an injury to a blood vessel.

When platelets stick to sites of blood vessel injury they must respond very rapidly to ensure the formation of a stable blood clot. Our research studies are aimed at understanding more closely the factors that regulate the adhesiveness of platelets, since this is an important deteminant not only in normal blood clot formation but also in the development of harmful blood clots (thrombosis).

Kisspeptin is a recently discovered neuropeptide that appears to play a major role in the regulation of GnRH cells. Because it is newly recognized, the significance of kisspeptin and the relevant receptor, GPR54, is not well defined. This project aims to use our unique combination of abilities to determine the significance of kisspeptin in the regulation of GnRH and gonadotropin secretion. We will study both sheep and monkey brains, measuring gene expression for kisspeptin and GPR54 in a range of physiological states and we will determine how kisspeptin acts on GnRH cells. We will determine whether kisspeptin plays a role in the feedback effects to GnRH cells. Effects on the pituitary gland will also be studied. We will use sheep models to measure kisspeptin effects on GnRH secretion, because this cannot be done in the monkey or the rodent. We will examine the function of kisspeptin and GPR54 in relation to puberty.

However, the exact role of individual areas remains highly controversial, making detailed physiological and anatomical studies in suitable primate models a key step to elucidating their function in the human brain. In this project, we will address the organization of a poorly known group of visual areas, which is located deep in a part of the brain called the interhemispheric fissure (the medial complex of visual areas). Preliminary evidence suggests that these areas may provide anatomical shortcuts linking vision, behavioural reactions, and emotion. Suppose, for example, that you are sitting outside reading. Although deep in concentration, you are still able to detect the sudden movement of an approaching object in your peripheral field of vision. In many cases you can react (e.g., by ducking , or raising your arms to protect the face) long before you register what the object actually is. An adrenaline rush often accompanies these quick motor reactions, implying a parallel activation of the autonomic nervous system. While the mechanism by which the brain promotes these quick reactions remains poorly understood, we believe that the medial complex of visual areas holds the key. The aim of this study is to map the anatomical framework underlying our ability to react to sudden stimuli in our peripheral visual field. Such work is fundamental for understanding the functional organization of the brain. It also has the potential to lay the groundwork for developments in areas of applied research, including medicine (e.g. the design of better rehabilitation strategies for people with brain damage) and the cognitive sciences (e.g. a better understanding of the factors that limit human responses to visual stimuli)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marcello Rosa","data":{"first_name":"Marcello","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033498","middle_name":"G.

At the first level of analysis, the primary visual cortex (V1), individual cells become active only if line segments or borders of a particular orientation are present in their field of detection, which encompasses a small part of the visual scene. Cells in other visual cortical areas (the extrastriate cortex) perform more complex detection tasks in comparison with those in V1, which demand integration of information coming from much larger portions of the visual scene. One example of these more complex properties is the phenomenon of long-range contour integration, where our visual system groups individual line segments having similar orientations, so that they are perceived as part of the same contour. This property is reflected in the electrical responses of cells in the dorsomedial visual area (DM). How are properties such as orientation specificity and long-range contour integration created? To begin addressing this question, we will investigate correlations between the physiological properties of identified cells, the spatial distribution of their information collecting regions (dendrites), and the anatomical pathways by which they receive information from other parts of the brain. This is a basic science study aimed at determining the extent to which the anatomical structure of the brain helps define the function of individual cells and brain areas. Its primary benefit will be to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying all sensory processing in the brain. The knowledge obtained may also lead to developments in areas of applied research including medicine and cognitive science (for example, understanding how the brain learns to interpret visual information in early life, and how visual processing degrades with ageing)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marcello Rosa","data":{"first_name":"Marcello","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033498","middle_name":"G.

Knowledge of the process is largely based on studies using semi-intact cell systems, however, meaning that the role of cytoskeletal elements in nuclear transport has been largely overlooked. Intriguingly, in vivo studies, including our own relating to signalling molecules important in the regulation of cancer, clearly implicate the cellular microtubule (MT) network as playing an integral role in nuclear import. We propose to carry out a detailed examination of the mechanistic basis of the dependence of nuclear import on the MT network of 3 molecules regulating cancer. We will compare the properties of these molecules to those of other nuclear localizing molecules, as well as examine the ability to mediate nuclear import of similar MT-associating sequences from viral and other proteins. The results will establish for the first time, the generality of the dependence of nuclear protein import on cytoskeletal elements. Since the movement of large DNA molecules by simple diffusion is a limiting factor in non-viral gene delivery approaches, the possibility of applying this knowledge to facilitate the transport of DNA encoding therapeutic gene products to the nucleus of target cells, will also be assessed for the first time. We will use the modular sequences that confer interaction with the MT network to assist gene transfer by including them in modular constructs we have designed with this in mind. We will thus be able to test directly for the first time whether MT-interaction can enhance the delivery of DNA to the nucleus and reporter gene expression, with obvious application in gene therapy approaches."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Jans","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6988","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["medical biotechnology","therapies and therapeutic technology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384105,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Jans","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384105","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"751161","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Jans","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6987","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["Benign Prostate Hypertrophy (BPH)","Cancer","Development","Prostate"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384104,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Gail Risbridger","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384104","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"664574","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gail Risbridger","data":{"first_name":"Gail","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009913","middle_name":"Petuna","last_name":"Risbridger","source_individual_id":"RMIS3978","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gail Risbridger"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79390","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6986","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Tai Chi for independent living: RCT of efficacy of Tai Chi in delaying disability among older people.","data":{"media_summary":"health related to ageing","end_year":2008,"keywords":["ageing","older persons and functional capacity","prevention of disability","randomised controlled trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384103,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["activities of daily living","ageing","disability","functional capacity in the elderly","health related to ageing"],"scientific_title":"Tai Chi for independent living: RCT of efficacy of Tai Chi in delaying disability among older people.","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Lesley Day","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384103","simplified_title":"The impact of Tai Chi in delaying the onset of disability among older people.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"1157574.22","source_system":"This study addresses the issue of disability among our ageing population. Preservation of function among our older citizens, and their capacity to live independently, is of significant social, public health and economic benefit. The aims of this study are to (1) test the efficacy of Tai Chi in delaying disability among older people, prior to its onset, (2) investigate the mechanisms by which Tai Chi intervenes in the disability pathway, (3) determine the cost-benefits of Tai Chi for older people. The study will recruit 670 people over 70 years of age and randomly assign them to receive either Tai Chi, or a stretching and relaxation program, for a period of 48 weeks. The groups will then be compared to determine if there is any difference in the development of disability as well as a range of functional outcomes such as strength, balance, depression, arthritic symptoms, life satisfaction, and falls. This will be the first study world-wide to test the impact of any exercise program on delaying the manifestation of disability among older people. Robust evidence that Tai Chi can in fact delay disability will have immediate and significant implications for the maintenance of independence among older people at a critical time for our ageing population. Translation of these research results to practice will decrease demand for support services for community dwelling older people, and for places in supported accommodation facilities. Older people will have improved quality of life, and government and non-government agencies will experience reduced demand for limited resources. This internationally significant study will also contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which disability develops, and create the valuable opportunity for continuing research on attrition of effect and long term adherence to exercise programs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Damien Jolley","data":{"first_name":"Damien","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037587","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Jolley","source_individual_id":"5015537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Damien Jolley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86736","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lesley Day","data":{"first_name":"Lesley","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036206","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Day","source_individual_id":"RMIS107824","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Lesley Day"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86388","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Keith Hill","data":{"first_name":"Keith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025491","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Hill","source_individual_id":"RMIS37832","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Keith Hill"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83564","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leonie Segal","data":{"first_name":"Leonie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016141","middle_name":"","last_name":"Segal","source_individual_id":"5017435","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Leonie Segal"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81074","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leon Flicker","data":{"first_name":"Leon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013045","middle_name":"","last_name":"Flicker","source_individual_id":"RMIS145624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leon Flicker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80226","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6985","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["hypertension","integrative cardiovascular physiology","kidney circulation","vascular biolody"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384101,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Roger Evans","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384101","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"548878","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Roger Evans","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018903","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Evans","source_individual_id":"5011298","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Roger Evans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81839","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6984","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel strategies for improving respiratory support and outcomes for very preterm babies","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["Glucocorticoid and retinoid treatments","Lung development and alveolar formation","Neonatal lung injury","Resuscitation and ventilation","Very premature infant"],"nhmrc_grant_id":384100,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Novel strategies for improving respiratory support and outcomes for very preterm babies","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Richard Harding","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384100","simplified_title":"Reducing lung damage and improving the future health of premature babies","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"8381820.23","source_system":"Very premature birth is the commonest cause of illness and death in newborn babies, making it one of the most serious and costly issues in perinatal medicine. The major problem suffered by very premature babies is lung immaturity and its associated harmful effects on brain development. Most very premature babies require resuscitation followed by ventilatory support,often for several weeks. This is extremely expensive and places an enormous financial burden on health care systems. Furthermore, it increases the risks of respiratory illnesses, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease which can impair breathing and increase susceptibility to respiratory disease such as asthma later in life. The overall aim of this program is to improve outcomes for very premature babies, including less lung injury, better respiratory health and shorter stays in hospitals. In order to reduce the health burden caused by very premature birth on the community we need to know more about how it alters the normal development of the lungs in the newborn period and into later life. In particular, we need to understand the cellular and molecular processes involved in lung development so that we can identify gene networks and developmental processes that are disrupted by severe premature birth. Such knowledge is necessary to provide a more rational, scientific basis for managing and treating the alterations in lung structure and function caused by premature birth. We also need to develop better ways of resuscitating and ventilating these infants so that lung injury is minimized.The research team is led by two neonatologists and three biomedical research scientists with a proven record of effective collaboration. This team is internationally unique in that it includes practicing neonatologists, respiratory physiologists and molecular biologists who have collaborated together productively and are regarded as world leaders in their respective fields. New talents have been brought into the team to provide expertise in pulmonary stem cell biology, the design of novel steroid drugs, and clinical follow-up. Together, this team has the potential (a) to greatly enhance the understanding of the impact of very premature birth on the developing lung, (b) to improve resuscitation and ventilation techniques, and (c) to translate the new knowledge into clinical practice to improve the outcome for prematurely born babies. Using well characterized animal models we will determine gene networks involved in fetal lung development and how these are altered by premature birth. The successful transition from fetal to postnatal life is critical for survival at birth but more information is needed. Using newborn lambs and rabbits, we will trial novel strategies for enhancing the transformation of the immaturelung into an effective gas exchange organ at birth.

Although lesioned axons can sprout spontaneously, this regeneration attempt is transitory and no significant re-growth occurs over long distances. Consequently, injury to the CNS often leads to permanent disability. In many cases, it has been shown that it is not the absence of growth-promoting molecules in the CNS but rather the presence of axon outgrowth inhibitors, including components of both CNS myelin and astroglial scars that limit regeneration. Given that axonal injury is an important pathological determinant of permanent disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), we have recently investigated the role of the CNS neurite outgrowth inhibitor, Nogo A in the development of a chronic form of murine MS-like disease. We showed that targeting Nogo A by active and passive immunization blunts clinical signs, demyelination and axonal damage associated with this model of MS. These results identify Nogo A as an important determinant of the development of autoimmune-mediated demyelination and suggest that its blockage may help to maintain and-or to restore the neuronal integrity of the CNS after autoimmune insult in disease such as MS. The principal goal of this application is to study the mechanism by which blockade of Nogo A improves clinical outcome in disease like MS and to determine whether neurite sprouting accounts for such an improvement. Targeting Nogo A and-or its receptor, has the potential to not only regulate-modulate the process of autoimmune mediated demyelination but could lead to the first therapy ever offered to patients that helps damaged nerves regenerate after axonal injury following neurodegeneration due to insult or disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Claude Bernard","data":{"first_name":"Claude","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029436","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Bernard","source_individual_id":"RMIS118720","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Claude Bernard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6941","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Clinical feasibility study of Omega-3 PUFA therapy for the reduction of post-cardiac surgery atrial arrhythmias","data":{"media_summary":"preventative therapy","end_year":2008,"keywords":["cardiac surgery","coronary artery graft / valve surgery","omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","postoperative atrial fibrillation","postoperative morbidity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":367644,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["ageing","omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids","post-cardiac surgery morbidity","post-operative atrial fibrillation","preventative therapy"],"scientific_title":"Clinical feasibility study of Omega-3 PUFA therapy for the reduction of post-cardiac surgery atrial arrhythmias","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Surgery","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Salvatore Pepe","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/367644","simplified_title":"Does omega-3 PUFA therapy reduce post-operative atrial arrhythmias?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"442092.61","source_system":"The aim of this study is to determine the molecular and clinical impact of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) pre-treatment 2 weeks before cardiac surgery in 150 patients. The outcome of this proposal will indicate proof of molecular concepts, clinical feasibility and specific design elements of a future, large scale, placebo controlled, prospective randomised trial of oral therapy with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Recently, omega-3 PUFA via fish diet was reported to be linked to low incidence of AF. The main aim is to provide a cheap and safe preventative therapy against post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF), a key heart rhythm disorder that occurs in at least 1 in 4 patients after heart surgery and increases post-operative complications, limits recovery and increases hospital stay and cost. Biochemical study elements are important to gain valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms (directly in human heart) that underlie post-operative heart rhythm disorder and may delineate new more precise molecular targets for therapy. No previous clinical study has ever examined whether omega-3 PUFA therapy prevents post-operative heart rhythm disorder. Use of 3g-day omega-3 PUFA pre-treatment in the surgical setting has been shown to be safe in a number of small studies, including our own. Our preliminary data indicates that therapy increases heart and blood content of omega-3 PUFA ~2-fold, and reduces the incidence of AF. Post-operative AF is an expensive resource burden in all cardiothoracic surgery units of Australian hospitals and targets key health priorities. Due to the non-patentable nature of omega-3 PUFA, significant industry based support for clinical research is limited. A positive outcome would rapidly pave the way for widespread use in elective surgery. Reduced length of hospital stay, cost-savings, and the increase in productivity as healthy individuals return to their communities would nationally repay the investment many fold."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Salvatore Pepe","data":{"first_name":"Salvatore","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039040","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pepe","source_individual_id":"RMIS68921","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Salvatore Pepe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87115","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Franklin Rosenfeldt","data":{"first_name":"Franklin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033506","middle_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"Rosenfeldt","source_individual_id":"RMIS68918","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Franklin Rosenfeldt"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85674","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leanne Delbridge","data":{"first_name":"Leanne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030340","middle_name":"Maree","last_name":"Delbridge","source_individual_id":"RMIS5220077","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leanne Delbridge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84874","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Mclennan","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026666","middle_name":"Leslie","last_name":"Mclennan","source_individual_id":"RMIS1133051","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Mclennan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83898","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julian Smith","data":{"first_name":"Julian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022199","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"RMIS68927","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julian Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82723","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brian Buxton","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018043","middle_name":"Fowell","last_name":"Buxton","source_individual_id":"RMIS190543","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Brian Buxton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81612","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6862","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Elucidating sub-clinical pathways to chronic rejection in lung transplantation and therapeutic implications","data":{"media_summary":"Lung transplantation","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome","Chronic rejection","Human cytomegalovirus","Immunosuppression","Lung transplantation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":364005,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome","Chronic rejection","Human cytomegalovirus","Immunosuppression","Lung transplantation"],"scientific_title":"Elucidating sub-clinical pathways to chronic rejection in lung transplantation and therapeutic implications","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Transplantation Immunology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Thomas Kotsimbos","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/364005","simplified_title":"The immune response to persistent antigens in lung transplantation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"416587.28","source_system":"Organ transplantation has become a feasible option for many end-stage clinical conditions, including advanced lung disease. However, despite often dramatic short term successful outcomes, late graft dysfunction due to chronic rejection remains a major obstacle to long-term success. This is particularly the case in lung transplantation despite the use of potent broad spectrum immunosuppressive agents. The three major risk factors that have been identified for chronic rejection following lung transplantation are acute rejection episodes diagnosed on lung biopsy, reactivation of the ubiquitous human DNA virus CMV and persistent lymphocytosis in the transplanted lung suggesting that potent broad spectrum immunosuppression may have both beneficial and harmful effects in lung transplant recipients. This proposal will apply sensitive new immunological techniques to detect and quantitate each of these risk factors at a sub-clinical level with a view to delineating their relationship with each other and with the development of chronic rejection following lung transplantation. This information will help unravel the pathogenesis of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients and improve clinical management decisions in these patients and therefore long term health

in just a few minutes. Stroke continues to be a major cause of death and disability, and this major medical challenge requires urgent research at the basic level to better understand the processes of normal, and then abnormal, regulation of brain artery function. The project will test the importance of a newly discovered mechanism for increasing brain blood flow. This involves activation of an enzyme, Nox4-containing NADPH-oxidase, to generate oxygen radicals which then relax the wall of blood vessels causing the arteries to let more blood through. We believe that this process plays an important role in the normal, healthy maintenance of blood supply to the brain. Furthermore, we propose that the activity of this enzyme is elevated and therefore protective in brain arteries during high blood presure - which is the major risk factor for stroke. We will specifically test whether the activity of this enzyme actually helps to limit the amount of brain death following stroke. We will use a variety of techniques to assess the importance of this enzyme in brain arteries in the living body, and also in isolated segments of brain artery from animals that are either healthy or have diseased brain arteries. The results are expected to provide major new insight into processes that help maintain brain blood flow under normal conditions and after a stroke, and the knowledge gained here should lead to safer therapies to prevent or treat stroke."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond","data":{"first_name":"Grant","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030471","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Drummond","source_individual_id":"RMIS2457825","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Grant Drummond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84911","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016332","middle_name":"Graeme","last_name":"Sobey","source_individual_id":"5017621","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Christopher Sobey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81135","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6280","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The nature of CNS circuitry subserving thirst.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["neuroanatomical tracing","neuroendocrinology","thirst","water and electrolyte homeostasis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350437,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["fluid and electrolyte balance","neuroanatomical connections","neuropsychiatric diseases"],"scientific_title":"The nature of CNS circuitry subserving thirst.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Brian Oldfield","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350437","simplified_title":"Understanding how the brain regulates thirst.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"226500","source_system":"Fluid intake is essential for survival.

A side-effect of these very high steroid doses is a major down-regulation of the immune system, particularly massive death of important immune cells called T-cells, which can have a major impact on patient recovery and potential mortality. These T cells are particularly sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced cell death and have very high levels of receptors for these steroids called glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). We have discovered a unique GR gene promoter (designated 1A) that is active in T cells. Very little is known about how this gene promoter is regulated. This promoter may be a useful therapeutic target to block T cell death (caused by steroids) during recovery from injury, infection and cancer. Separation of anti-inflammatory and side-effects such as high T-cell death or blockade of these effects on T cells would have a major impact on patient immune status and recovery, and reduce the incidence of debilitating side-effects. Therapeutic down-regulation of this T cell-specific GR gene promoter could lead to targeted blockade of steroid-induced T cell death and help maintain a strong immune system. This application brings together a unique team of investigators (CIs) that have a strong history of collaboration in this area with recent publications in very high ranking international journals. The CIs bring a multi-disciplined approach combining endocrinology, molecular biology and cellular immunology to determine the underlying mechanisms of steroid actions and their effects on immune function.

Collectively, cleft lip and palate is the fourth most common congenital disorder in humans, occurring with a frequency of between 1 in 600 and 1 in 1000 live births worldwide. This high frequency is reflective of the heightened susceptibility of the developing face to genetic and-or environmental perturbation and likely arises as a direct consequence of the rapid and significant morphological changes that ultimately generate the human face. Yet despite the clinical significance of this abnormality and the psychological and financial burden to the patient and their family, there is relatively little known about the genetic and, in particular, cellular mechanisms responsible. We are seeking to understand the cellular and developmental role(s) of two key proteins in the formation of the upper lip and palate. It is anticipated that these studies will provide valuable new clues as to the molecular events that underlie some forms of cleft lip and palate as well as reveal a likely mechanism to explain some of the marked clinical variability that is seen most prominently in the isolated forms of cleft lip and palate.

Disorders arising from such spasms include sudden death, neurological deficits, visual and hearing loss or impairment, Raynaud's phenomenon (painful episodic contraction of the fingers and toes) and intestinal necrosis. Common mechanisms are likely to underlie the spasms associated with these disparate disorders. In a recent electrophysiological study of vascular smooth muscle, we discovered a novel membrane current which we refer to as the plateau current. This current has a strong depolarizing influence that is likely to make a major contribution to the spasms, particularly in arterioles and small arteries which are more dependent on depolarization for contraction. Block of this current is expected to minimize the depolarization and therefore prevent or ameliorate spasm of the vessels. Thus the plateau current represents a new field of therapeutic potential for addressing vascular problems that have significant health implications. However, therapeutic manipulation of the current requires knowledge of its properties. In this project we will determine the biophysical and pharmacological properties of this current using voltage-clamp techniques. We will then use this information to assess its functional significance by recording membrane potential with intracellular microelectrodes simultaneously with contractile activity. We will also compare small vessels obtained from volunteers with or without the vasospastic disorder of Raynaud's phenomenon. Our previous work using these techniques was described in J Physiol as a microelectrode, patch clamp and myograph study of the highest quality and of supreme technical difficulty and scored a Top-Ten hit rate. Since we are the only ones to record the plateau current, we are in a unique position to make significant progress to our understanding of contraction, including spasm, in small blood vessels."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helena Parkington","data":{"first_name":"Helena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044715","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Parkington","source_individual_id":"5016864","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Helena Parkington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88566","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Barry Mcgrath","data":{"first_name":"Barry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026630","middle_name":"Patrick","last_name":"Mcgrath","source_individual_id":"RMIS111356","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Barry Mcgrath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83885","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Harold Coleman","data":{"first_name":"Harold","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024194","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Coleman","source_individual_id":"RMIS55381","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Harold Coleman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83213","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Marianne Tare","data":{"first_name":"Marianne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004944","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tare","source_individual_id":"5017841","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Marianne Tare"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78038","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6025","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Alveolar epithelial cell differentiation and apoptosis: effects of preterm birth, corticosteroids and stretch.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["alveolar epithelial cells","corticosteroids","fetal and postnatal lung development","lung injury","premature birth"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334161,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cell growth / differentiation","infant, premature","lung development","respiratory insufficiency in the newborn"],"scientific_title":"Alveolar epithelial cell differentiation and apoptosis: effects of preterm birth, corticosteroids and stretch.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Stuart Hooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334161","simplified_title":"Effect of preterm birth, corticosteroids and stretch on airway epithelial cells in the fetus and newborn","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"484500","source_system":"In the lung, gas exchange takes place in small terminal airsacs called alveoli. The internal surface of the alveoli are lined with 2 types of specialist cells, the type-I and type-II cells. Both cells are essential for the normal functioning of the lung; type-I cells provide a thin barrier for the gas exchange, whereas type-II cells produce the surface-active material, surfactant. In order to survive after birth, the lungs of the newborn must have appropriate numbers of each of these cell types. However, babies that are born very prematurely have few, if any, mature cells as most are non-specialised cells that possess none of the characteristics of mature type-I and type-II cells. Therefore, the lungs of very preterm babies have low levels of surfactant, are prone to injury and infection and are not efficient in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. As such, these infants are at high risk of developing chronic lung disease which is a serious debilitating disease that has long term health implications. We believe that the non-specialised cells are more prone to injury and cell death than mature cells which makes the very premature infant more susceptible to the development of chronic lung disease. As the survival and respiratory health of these infants depends upon most type-I and type-II cells maturing after birth, it is critical to understand the factors that regulate their maturation. This information will allow the development of treatments that can enhance the maturation of these cell types. This application is focused towards understanding the factors that control maturation of type-I and type-II cells, as well as the role of the non-specialised cells in the development of chronic lung disease in babies that are born very prematurely."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Megan Wallace","data":{"first_name":"Megan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040295","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Wallace","source_individual_id":"RMIS1016419","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Megan Wallace"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87439","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Timothy Cole","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024191","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Cole","source_individual_id":"5014013","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Timothy Cole"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83211","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stuart Hooper","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007960","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Hooper","source_individual_id":"5015309","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stuart Hooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78853","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6024","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of musculoskeletal biomechanical factors in cartilage loss in those who undergo partial medial menisectomy.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["arthroscopic partial menisectomy","biomechanical factors","joint cartilage loss","lifestyle factors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334151,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["biomechanical factors","osteoarthritis risk","prevention"],"scientific_title":"Role of musculoskeletal biomechanical factors in cartilage loss in those who undergo partial medial menisectomy.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Flavia Cicuttini","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334151","simplified_title":"Role of musculoskeletal biomechanical factors in cartilage loss in those who undergo partial medial menisectomy.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"654530","source_system":"The novel outcomes from our project are that we will identify whether musculoskeletal-biomechanical factors that can be modified are associated with adverse cartilage changes in a subgroup of individuals with an increased risk of developing knee OA, those who have undergone an APM. The findings of this research are timely and of major international significance as there is increasing attention being paid to preventing OA rather than merely treating the signs and symptoms. Our state-of-the-art measure of cartilage changes will allow us to detect those at risk much sooner than traditional measures using radiographs. The measures are also leading edge internationally. We chose these specific factors to investigate as there is evidence that they can be modified with appropriate interventions. For example, static joint alignment could be modified with foot orthoses [Crenshaw, 2000 #1016], muscle weakness can be addressed with strength programs and mechanical loading across the knee could be reduced via weight loss programs or techniques to alter gait patterns. Currently, formal supervised post-operative rehabilitation is not routinely prescribed following APM because it is considered a routine procedure. If our research identifies risk factors for increased cartilage loss then we will be able to develop appropriate intervention strategies for individuals following an APM. These interventions can then be formally tested as to their effectiveness in reducing adverse cartilage changes using randomised controlled trials. In particular, this could lead to changes in current post-operative clinical practice for this patient group. Ultimately, this could reduce the risk of OA in the future and the resultant personal and societal costs of this condition."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Lloyd","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026347","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Lloyd","source_individual_id":"5016023","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Lloyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83813","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Forbes","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024874","middle_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Forbes","source_individual_id":"5012745","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Forbes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83393","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Flavia Cicuttini","data":{"first_name":"Flavia","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018263","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Cicuttini","source_individual_id":"RMIS3994","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Flavia Cicuttini"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81679","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gwidon Stachowiak","data":{"first_name":"Gwidon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016384","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Stachowiak","source_individual_id":"RMIS6309","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gwidon Stachowiak"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81150","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kim Bennell","data":{"first_name":"Kim","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000329","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Bennell","source_individual_id":"RMIS97963","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kim Bennell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76743","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6023","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effect of lifestyle factors on knee cartilage volume and rate of cartilage loss in a normal population","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["diet","joint cartilage","knee","obesity","prevention"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334150,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["knee","obesity","osteoarthritis","prevention"],"scientific_title":"Effect of lifestyle factors on knee cartilage volume and rate of cartilage loss in a normal population","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rheumatology and Arthritis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Flavia Cicuttini","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334150","simplified_title":"Effect of lifestyle factors on knee cartilage volume and rate of cartilage loss in a normal population","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"236500","source_system":"Osteoarthritis (OA) has been described by the WHO as a potential epidemic and a major health and care services cost driver in an aging society.

To date, most research has focused on treating the resulting pain and disability.

This proposal aims to identify life-style factors, such as diet, physical activity and obesity that effect knee cartilage health in healthy subjects, thereby identifying potential targets for future prevention of OA.

Because of the strategic position of the prostate, its enlargement physically compresses the segment of the urinary system passing through it causing inconvenient and distressing symptoms, such as difficulty and hesitancy in urination, which often require surgical or medical intervention. Indeed patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia are often treated with pharmacological agents that reduce the size of the prostate or relax the prostate and bladder, thus relieving some of the symptoms. However, the precise cellualr mechanisms by which many of these drugs mediate their effects have not been confirmed. Moreover, although previous studies of the prostate gland have clearly established many of the basic properties of the tissue, there is currently a lack of information regarding the prostate gland at a cellular level. We have recently identified a specialised group of 'interstitial cells' in the prostate gland, which resemble the well-described 'interstitial cells of Cajal' in the gut. In the gut, these cells perform a wide variety of functions including the initiation of contractile activity. Interstitial cells are also thought to play a role in diseases of the bowel. This project aims to investigate the role of the interstitial cells in the functioning of the prostate gland. In addition, the effects of age and hormones on the interstitial cells will be considered, which may lead to a better understanding of conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finally, identifying nerve-released substances that may affect the activity of these cells may also help identify alternative targets for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Sabatino Ventura","data":{"first_name":"Sabatino","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010830","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ventura","source_individual_id":"RMIS188961","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Sabatino Ventura"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79645","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Betty Exintaris","data":{"first_name":"Betty","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007186","middle_name":"","last_name":"Exintaris","source_individual_id":"RMIS1022989","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Betty Exintaris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78640","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6021","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigating the use of bone marrow transplantation to study and treat polycystic kidney disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["bone marrow transplantation","cilia","polycystic kidney disease","tubular epithelium"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334130,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease","autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease","end stage renal disease"],"scientific_title":"Investigating the use of bone marrow transplantation to study and treat polycystic kidney disease","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

At present, there are no reliable ways to prevent the onset or slow the progression of PKD. The kidney consists of a complex system of tubules and ducts. PKD causes the cells that make up these tubules and ducts to grow uncontrollably and form cysts. We are using mice to study how mutations affect the mechanisms that control cell growth in the kidney and cause PKD. Bone marrow cells can move to the kidney and repair it after damage. We will test if bone marrow cells carrying a PKD mutation can cause PKD when transplanted into a healthy mouse. This will help us learn how mutations cause PKD in humans.

Much of the brain damage that follows a hemorrhagic stroke is attributable to the presence of free iron which mediates oxidative stress in brain cells. This iron originates from hemin, which in turn is derived from the hemoglobin in extravasated blood cells. The fact that iron is freed from hemin in the post-stroke period makes it an attractive therapeutic target. However, remarkably little is known about the metabolism of hemin by the different types of brain cells. The present project investigates the metabolism and neurotoxicity of hemin in brain cells and will examine the capacity of potential therapeutic agents to protect brain cells from hemin toxicity. The data obtained from this project will advance our understanding of the uptake and metabolism of hemin by the four main types of brain cell, and the factors that are likely to be involved in the neurotoxicity of hemin-derived iron following hemorrhagic stroke. The study will also provide data concerning the relative effectiveness of potential therapeutic agents, and information concerning the cell types, time points and aspects of hemin metabolism that are most effectively targeted by these agents. Such advances will guide the development of therapeutic approaches that are directed at minimising the brain damage which results from hemin-derived iron in humans."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Robinson","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033468","middle_name":"Richard","last_name":"Robinson","source_individual_id":"RMIS103788","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Robinson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85665","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ralf Dringen","data":{"first_name":"Ralf","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018769","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dringen","source_individual_id":"RMIS1668389","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ralf Dringen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81806","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6019","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of the intracellular pathogen-recognition molecule Nod1 in the host response to Helicobacter pylori infection.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Helicobacter pylori","Host-pathogen interactions","Innate immunity","Microbial pathogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334127,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Gastric cancer","Gastritis","Gastrointestinal inflammation","Peptic ulcer disease"],"scientific_title":"The role of the intracellular pathogen-recognition molecule Nod1 in the host response to Helicobacter pylori infection.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Microbiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Richard Ferrero","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334127","simplified_title":"Host defence against infection from the ulcer-causing bacterium, Helicobacter pylori.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"243000","source_system":"The report in 1982 by two Australian clinicians, Drs Marshall and Warren, of a link between a spiral-shaped bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, and stomach disease in humans was to prove one of the ground breaking discoveries of medical research in the last 20-30 years. Despite extensive studies since, including the sequencing of the entire genomes of two different H. pylori isolates, many issues relating to H. pylori disease remain unanswered. For instance, it is still not known why all infected individuals develop inflammation of the stomach lining, yet only a proportion (15-20%) will go on to develop severe diseases, such as peptic ulcer disease and stomach cancer. Recent work from our groups has identified the mechanism by which H. pylori induces host responses in the cells lining the stomach, the epithelial cell. The interaction of the bacterium with these cells represents its first contact with the host, and sets the scene for the development of immune responses in the stomach. From their position on the outside surfaces of epithelial cells, certain strains of H. pylori are able to deliver a bacterial component into host cells, thus triggering an inflammatory response in the latter. Curiously, a host molecule called Nod1, which is present on the inside of cells and not on the surface, acts as an internal sensor by interpreting the entry of this H. pylori component as a danger signal for the host. The aim of the project will be to characterise the resulting defence mechanisms that are induced by Nod1 in order to prevent the colonisation of the stomach by H. pylori bacteria. It is expected that this work will address questions concerning the role of host immune defence mechanisms in H. pylori infection and stomach disease. Amongst the possible public health benefits of this work will be the development of novel therapies to reduce inflammation in the stomach by blocking Nod1 responses to H. pylori bacterial components."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Richard Ferrero","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007251","middle_name":"Louis","last_name":"Ferrero","source_individual_id":"5014611","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Richard Ferrero"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78657","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6018","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Modelling the economics of the Australian Health care system for policy analysis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Capacity building","Health Care systems","Health Economics","Modelling","Policy analysis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334114,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Modelling the economics of the Australian Health care system for policy analysis","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health Economics","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"ECONOMICS","cia_name":"Prof Anthony Harris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334114","simplified_title":"Modelling the Health Care system","sub_type":"Health Services Research","total_budget":"3500000","source_system":"The program will build a suite of economic models capable of providing timely relevant analysis of almost any major health policy option or issue, providing expertise in government and academia to use the kind of sophisticated quantitative tools of analysis common in sectors of the economy of an equivalent size to health.

However some recent overseas studies have suggested that tiny particles less than 0.1 thousandths of a millimetre might have the greatest effects on the heart and lungs. We will conduct the first Australian study of the health effects of these tiny particles. Particle counts will be measured in Melbourne by CSIRO using state of the art equipment. Two groups of older subjects will be recruited: patients with chronic lung diseases such as emphysema and patients with heart disease. They will perform regular breathing tests and-or have the electrical activity of their hearts recorded. The recordings will be analysed to detect small variations in heart rate. If we find relationships between particle counts and lung function or heart rate variability, this will provide new evidence of the health effects of air pollution.

We are characterizing mice which lack this enzyme. 4-phosphatase deficient mice demonstrate significant abnormalities in the brain and bone marrow. These mice appear unable to make circulating platelets, small anucleate cells which are vital in preventing bleeding. We will determine how the 4-phosphatase functions in regulating platelet production, by examining the bone marrow and blood of these mice. These studies are significant as platelet production is essential for prevention of blood loss following trauma and also is of vital importance in conditions associated with blood clotting including heart attack and stroke.

We have discovered a gene called Intersectin-1, located on human chromosome 21, that is expressed at higher levels than normal in individuals with Down syndrome. Intersectin-1 has a role in endocytosis, a process whereby cells take up molecules from the outside. Endocytosis occurs in all cells but is highly specialised in the brain where chemical transmitters are released and then rapidly recovered by endocytosis in a process enabling neurones to pass signals to one another. A disturbance in endocytosis has been reported as the earliest hallmark of Alzheimer's disease in both non-Down syndrome and Down syndrome individuals. This disturbance is characterised by the presence of enlarged endosomes (small packages in neuronal cells containing chemical neurotransmitters formed during endocytosis). These enlarged endosomes are present long before the characteristic plaques of Alzheimer's disease appear. Since all individuals with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's-like neuropathology, there must be a common disease mechanism that can be traced to the extra gene dosage from chromosome 21.

This knowledge will provide a platform for developing rational strategies for the production of new antimicrobials for fighting infections by this and related pathogens."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Cynthia Whitchurch","data":{"first_name":"Cynthia","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017067","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Whitchurch","source_individual_id":"5018278","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Cynthia Whitchurch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81332","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6007","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Contribution of disturbed blood flow and cerebral metabolism to white matter damage in the perinatal brain","data":{"media_summary":"Perinatal asphyxia","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Cerebral blood flow","Cerebral palsy","Cyclooxygenase and prostaglandins","Fetal asphyxia","Perinatal brain damage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334074,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Brain damage","Cerebral palsy","Ischaemia/Reperfusion injury","Oxidative stress","Perinatal asphyxia"],"scientific_title":"Contribution of disturbed blood flow and cerebral metabolism to white matter damage in the perinatal brain","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr David Walker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334074","simplified_title":"Why is white matter in the fetal brain vulnerable to damage?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"369375","source_system":"It has been known for some time that the white matter regions of the developing brain are particularly vulnerable to damage. These regions are deep in the brain near the ventricles, and are rich in myelin sheaths wrapped around the nerve fibres running from cell-rich areas in the outer layers of the brain to other regions, and down into the spinal cord. Damage to white matter usually leads to behavioural, learning and motor problems in the newborn infant - in its severest form, seen as cerebral palsy. Such outcomes are often associated with the presence of asphyxia and infection during pregnancy, leading to the belief that the damage first arises while the baby is still in utero. In this application we suggest that asphyxia and-or infection during pregnancy cause prolonged disturbances in the regulation of blood flow and integrity of the blood-brain barrier in the developing brain, together with changes in metabolism that result in accumulation of prostaglandins and the toxic hydroxyl radical, leading irreversibly to cell death. If this series of events proves to be true, we have suggested and will test several protocols for protecting the fetal brain, which should be readily translatable to clinical practice."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Walker","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022785","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"5018162","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82870","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Jonathan Hirst","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0019636","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hirst","source_individual_id":"RMIS59251","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jonathan Hirst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82003","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Adrian Walker","data":{"first_name":"Adrian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010883","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS59623","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Adrian Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79666","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Margie Castillo-Melendez","data":{"first_name":"Margie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000764","middle_name":"","last_name":"Castillo-Melendez","source_individual_id":"5013815","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Margie Castillo-Melendez"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76875","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6006","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory diseases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Arthritis","Coagulation","Inflammation","glomerulonephritis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334067,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory diseases","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Stephen Holdsworth","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334067","simplified_title":"Mechanisms of inflammatory diseases","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"5527669.62","source_system":"This research is directed by a team of medical and basic scientists with expertise in mechanisms of inflammation relevant to human disease.

This project aims to work with general practitioners to develop a method or strategy to increase the uptake of guidelines for the treatment of acute low back pain, particularly to reduce the number of patients who are unnecessarily x-rayed, and to increase advice to stay active. The effectiveness of the developed strategy will be tested by randomly assigning general practice clinics to either receive the intervention or to have access to the guidelines without any extra interventions (such as training and reminders) to help doctors change their practice. Both the doctor's practice, and patient outcomes of pain and disability will be measured to determine not only if the doctors followed the guidelines, but whether this resulted in an improvement in patient outcome. The findings of this study will help us understand the best ways to improve adhesion to guidelines and so has the potential to be applied to other conditions presenting to general practice where there are recommendations not currently being implemented into practice."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Neil Spike","data":{"first_name":"Neil","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033974","middle_name":"","last_name":"Spike","source_individual_id":"RMIS4018854","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Neil Spike"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85794","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Joanne Mckenzie","data":{"first_name":"Joanne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020774","middle_name":"Ellen","last_name":"Mckenzie","source_individual_id":"RMIS2992132","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Joanne Mckenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82314","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Denise O'Connor","data":{"first_name":"Denise","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015319","middle_name":"Ann","last_name":"O'Connor","source_individual_id":"5011904","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Denise O'Connor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80858","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Duncan Mortimer","data":{"first_name":"Duncan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015093","middle_name":"Stuart","last_name":"Mortimer","source_individual_id":"5016566","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Duncan Mortimer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80789","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sally Green","data":{"first_name":"Sally","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013337","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Green","source_individual_id":"RMIS379483","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sally Green"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80306","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeremy Grimshaw","data":{"first_name":"Jeremy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007617","middle_name":"Michael","last_name":"Grimshaw","source_individual_id":"RMIS2239336","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jeremy Grimshaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78760","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Schattner","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004475","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schattner","source_individual_id":"RMIS216877","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Schattner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77912","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6002","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"ENCODING ACTIVE TACTILE SENSING IN THE BRAIN","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Neural coding","Sensory Cortex","Tactile perception"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334052,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["CNS function","Nerve physiology","Sensory function"],"scientific_title":"ENCODING ACTIVE TACTILE SENSING IN THE BRAIN","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Ramesh Rajan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334052","simplified_title":"HOW THE BRAIN CODES FOR FINE TOUCH PERCEPTION","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"251000","source_system":"We are able to identify and discriminate objects in the world because of exquisitely detailed and rapid processing of sensory information by neurons in the cortex of the brain. In this project we will examine these operations in neurons in the cortex that receive input from the large face whiskers of the rat. These whiskers are used for fine-grain discrimination and for gauging distance. They are deflected by being actively moved, under muscle control, over objects (active touch) or by being passively deflected by objects. Deflection results in inputs to the brain that are processed to form the neural basis for very finely detailed perceptual behaviour. In rats, with impoverished visual and auditory senses, the whiskers are the major sensory system for interacting with the world, and are used in navigating the environment and in finding and distinguishing foods. Thus they contribute strongly to the remarkable success of this species. This elegant sensory system has a number of advantages that make it a very good model for the study of brain mechanisms responsible for active fine-grain sensory function. We plan to take advantage of the unique features of this system to define the information processing that occurs in the cortex in this elegantly complex system. This will address an issue relevant to all sensory systems - namely the neural basis of complex fine grain perceptual behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms underlying active tactile perception also has relevance to clinical conditions involving deficits in active touch e.g., in diabetic polyneuropathy (which eventually affects ~50% of diabetics), in leprosy (in which an early sign is damage to active touch). Knowledge of the core brain processes in active touch gained in this study could eventually underpin the ameliorative technologies for such deficits."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ramesh Rajan","data":{"first_name":"Ramesh","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027485","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rajan","source_individual_id":"5017097","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Ramesh Rajan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84094","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Antony Goodwin","data":{"first_name":"Antony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001852","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Goodwin","source_individual_id":"RMIS4592588","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Antony Goodwin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77174","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6001","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Helix VIII of G protein coupled receptors is a lipid-activated signalling sensor","data":{"media_summary":"Vascular regulation","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Angiotensin receptor","G protein coupled receptors","Membrane-mediated signalling","Molecular pharmacology","Peptide-membrane interactions"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334049,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Cardiac hypertrophy","Cardiovascular disease and hypertension","Endocrine disorders","Pharmacology","Vascular regulation"],"scientific_title":"Helix VIII of G protein coupled receptors is a lipid-activated signalling sensor","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Marie-Isabel Aguilar","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334049","simplified_title":"Effect of membrane lipids on G protein coupled receptors","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"389250","source_system":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest superfamily of membrane-embedded receptors and represent prime targets for drug development.

The technique establishes a statistical transformation between instruments commonly used in clinical trials and a utility value. While the technique appears highly useful, based on a priority setting exercise in osteoarthritis enabling 20 disparate interventions to be compared its validity and applicability in other contexts is not established. The purpose of the grant is to explore the TTU technique to i) establish the best method for estimating the regression equation between common health outcome measures and a utility score and validating that method; ii) test generalisability to other disease areas, for which quality of life is the primary objective of management (in stroke, drug dependence and depression), iii) develop and validate a method for translating the most commonly used measure of general health status, the SF-36, into a utility score and iv) illustrate the application of the TTU in comparing intervensions for the prevention and management of depression. The results of the research will be of value to i) decision makers who must compare the performance of medical-health care interventions across a range of diseases and modalities and ii) to clinicians who want to practice evidenced based health care.

All men aged 75 years have a 10-15% risk of having a stroke or heart attack in the next 5 years. Low dose aspirin has been shown to prevent further strokes and heart attacks in people who have already had one. It has been also shown to protect people who have not had a heart attack or stroke but who are at increased risk. Given that the elderly are at increased risk why do we need to do a trial in this particular group? The reason is that relatively few elderly patients were included in the previous prevention trials. Also while the elderly may have the most to gain from treatment, they also have the most to lose because they are more likely to suffer from side-effects. Aspirin prevents heart attacks by stopping clots forming in blood vessels. This also means that people taking it have an increased tendency to bleed. Thus though it may prevent strokes due to clots it may also increase the risk of strokes caused by bleeding. Bleeding from the gut is another major problem as aspirin tends to erode the lining of the stomach. Minor bleeding from the gut can also lower blood oxygen carrying capacity which may exacerbate other diseases associated with ageing, e.g. heart failure. Dementia may be caused by repeated clots in small or large vessels. Dementia is a particular problem in the elderly affecting 10% of 85 year olds. It is a major cause of loss of quality of life and a significant cost to the community. Aspirin may reduce the progression of such a disease leading to a maintained quality of life (QOL) for individuals and their families. As our age increases our years of life remaining decreases. This is self-evident. Thus the potential to add years to life reduces and the potential of diseases to adversely affect quality of life becomes more important. Thus it may be more important to prevent a nonfatal stroke that leads to institutionalisation than a fatal stroke.

This is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilator function, increased smooth muscle tone and increased constriction to nerve stimulation. A combination of intracellular electrophysiological techniques and tension recordings will be used to investigate detailed mechanisms in arteries isolated from key vascular beds. In vivo studies will probe the role of vitamin D deficiency in the control of regional blood flow control, and its influence on the underlying regulatory mechanisms responsible for the cardiovascular dysfunction that we have observed. We will test whether the cardiovascular dysfunction in the offspring following vitamin D deficiency is reversible upon repletion, or is programmed and thus not reversible with repletion. Our early results suggest that the deleterious effects are not reversible. From this study we aim to be in a position of greater confidence from which to inform women as to the importance for their baby of ensuring adequate vitamin D repletion during pregnancy, to minimise risk of later cardiovascular disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Marelyn Wintour-Coghlan","data":{"first_name":"Marelyn","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0046345","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wintour-Coghlan","source_individual_id":"RMIS3009735","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Marelyn Wintour-Coghlan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89005","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helena Parkington","data":{"first_name":"Helena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044715","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Parkington","source_individual_id":"5016864","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Helena Parkington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88566","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ruth Morley","data":{"first_name":"Ruth","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032690","middle_name":"","last_name":"Morley","source_individual_id":"RMIS112065","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ruth Morley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85467","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Marianne Tare","data":{"first_name":"Marianne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004944","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tare","source_individual_id":"5017841","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Marianne Tare"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78038","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5997","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Risk and Determinants of Fatal and Non-Fatal Coronary Heart Disease in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Cardiovascular Risk Factors","Cohort Study","Epidemiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334032,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Acute Myocardial Infarction","Cardiovascular Disease","Coronary Heart Disease"],"scientific_title":"Risk and Determinants of Fatal and Non-Fatal Coronary Heart Disease in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

These are best defined through the use of large cohort studies, which are those that follow up a group of individuals over time. Statistical analyses are used to develop prediction equations to quantify the effects of multiple risk factors in terms of their contributions to risk of heart disease. The current heart disease prediction equations most commonly used in Australia are based on older overseas studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study. Other than having low relevance to the current Australian population, they incorporate only a limited range of traditional risk factors. A spectrum of new risk factors is emerging. This study aims to develop risk prediction equations for heart disease that are applicable to the current Australian population, using contemporary data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. Results from this study will allow the future onset of heart disease to be predicted with accuracy and confidence, which in turn will allow preventive strategies, including expensive drugs, to be utilised in a more effective manner.

More ominously, recent WHO reports show that cardiovascular disease is the major health burden facing developing countries, particularly in our region. Although some of the burden of cardiovascular diseases may be reduced by effective public health measures (e.g., to reduce saturated fat intake), hypertension remains largely impervious to preventative public health measures. While treatment of established high blood pressure can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, preventing the development of hypertension in the first place is not possible at this time. A major impediment to the development of effective public health measure is our lack of knowledge of the pathological mechanisms involved, despite over 100 years of active research effort. The experiments planned in this study will probe below the surface of two important facts known about hypertension but not previously brought together - that the kidney's blood vessels and nerves are remodeled in hypertension, and that the kidney's control of the level of blood pressure must be changed in order for high blood pressure to develop in the first place.

We are studying the processes that control platelets sticking to the exposed vessel wall, to each other and to other cells to form a stable blood clot at the site of injury to stop bleeding. The same processes, when unchecked, could lead to the formation of harmful large blood clots that may block blood vessels in the heart or brain, resulting in heart attack or stroke. Platelets stick to the blood vessel wall and each other through sticky proteins called receptors on the cell surface. Receptors are able to bind to their specific ligands such as von Willebrand factor (vWf) and collagen which become exposed following vessel wall damage. The interaction between the ligands and receptors will trigger many biochemical changes within platelets, called signal transduction, that control platelet stickiness. The aim of this research project is to investigate the signalling processes that are utilised by the major platelet receptor called integrin alpha IIb beta 3. We are particularly interested in identifying the negative signalling process utilised by this receptor to dampen the positive signals required for platelet stickiness, to achieve a balanced clotting process. The identification of these specific signalling pathways will not only increase our knowledge of blood clot formation in health and disease, but also help develop potential new therapies for the prevention of heart diseases and strokes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Hatem Salem","data":{"first_name":"Hatem","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033592","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Salem","source_individual_id":"RMIS424191","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Hatem Salem"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85698","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Yuping Yuan","data":{"first_name":"Yuping","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0029017","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yuan","source_individual_id":"RMIS224659","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Yuping Yuan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84525","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5993","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of Mal in Toll-like receptor signal transduction of the pro-inflammatory response.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Endotoxin-elicited response","Inflammation","Innate Immunity","NF-kappa B (NF-kB)","Signaling pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334023,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cell signaling","infectiocute inflammation","innate immunity","septic shock"],"scientific_title":"The role of Mal in Toll-like receptor signal transduction of the pro-inflammatory response.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Ashley Mansell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334023","simplified_title":"Signal transduction in septic shock","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"472500","source_system":"Sepsis kills more people per year than the cancers of the breast, colon, prostate and pancreas combined. Sepsis occurs in 1 of 50 hospital admissions and is the leading cause of death n intensive care units. The instance of sepsis has doubled in the last decade and is expected to increase. One of the major causes of sepsis si lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main constituent of gram-negative bacteria's cell wall, and the prototypic inducer of the pro-inflammatory response of the innate immune system. Dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory response can lead to sepsis. Recently, the mammalian receptor for LPS was found to be Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, the activation of which activates a signal transduction pathway that initiates the pro-inflammatory response. We have previously shown a key role for an adapter protein called Mal in mediating signal transduction pathways upon activation of TLR-4. Interaction of Mal with a key signal transduction mediator called TRAF6 has been shown to induce the activation of the pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, Mal has been found to undergo degradation which may indicate a means of regulating the continued activation of the pro-inflammatory pathway. This research program will investigate the role of Mal in mediating signal transduction in TLR activated macrophages, key responsive cells of the innate immune system to microbial infection. A greater understanding of these processes will assist in the development of therapeutics to alleviate the consequences of microbial-induced inflammation, including chronic inflammatory diseases and sepsis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ashley Mansell","data":{"first_name":"Ashley","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026490","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mansell","source_individual_id":"RMIS2022114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ashley Mansell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83847","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5992","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Evaluation of Aspirin and Tranexamic Acid in Coronary Artery Surgery: The ATACAS Trial","data":{"media_summary":"surgical outcomes research","end_year":2007,"keywords":["anaesthesia","cardiac surgery","cardiology","intensive care","pharmacology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334015,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["clinical research","coronary artery bypass surgery","intensive care","mortality","surgical outcomes research"],"scientific_title":"Evaluation of Aspirin and Tranexamic Acid in Coronary Artery Surgery: The ATACAS Trial","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Surgery","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Myles","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334015","simplified_title":"The ATACAS Trial","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"1185000","source_system":"This large study will compare two types of drug treatment in 4600 patients undergoing heart surgery, to see whether either can reduce the risk of death or major complications. The complications after surgery we are measuring include heart attack, stroke, lung embolism, bleeding around the heart, breathing failure, kidney failure, major haemorrhage, serious wound infection, and death. The first drug being tested is low-dose aspirin. It is believed that aspirin can reduce the risk of a further heart attack or stroke in patients with pre-existing heart disease. There is some evidence that aspirin may have similar effects in people undergoing heart surgery, but such use is constrained by a concern that there may be an increased risk of bleeding after surgery. For this reason, most patients having heart surgery are advised to stop their aspirin about one week before surgery. But patients could be missing out on aspirin's beneficial effects. At present, we do not know whether the benefits of aspirin could outweigh the risk of excesive bleeding. The second drug being tested is tranexamic acid. This drug prevents blood clot being broken down at the stitching sites of surgery, and probably reduces the amount of blood loss during and after heart surgery. It is known that use of this drug reduces the need for a blood transfusion. It is possible that this could avoid other more serious complications after surgery. Both of these drugs are being tested individually, but in addition we are testing whether they may have an extra beneficial effect when used together.

Success in this research program has the capacity to save millions of lives each year by preventing the deadly toll of this important human scourge."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Magdalena Plebanski","data":{"first_name":"Magdalena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027374","middle_name":"","last_name":"Plebanski","source_individual_id":"5011488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Magdalena Plebanski"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84070","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brian Cooke","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024234","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Cooke","source_individual_id":"5014045","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Brian Cooke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83225","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Coppel","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012469","middle_name":"Leon","last_name":"Coppel","source_individual_id":"RMIS69215","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Coppel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80068","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Von Itzstein","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005229","middle_name":"","last_name":"Von Itzstein","source_individual_id":"5018138","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Mark Von Itzstein"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78121","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5989","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Control mechanisms of reproductive processes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Biology of inhibins, activines and follistatin","Control of spermatogenesis and genetics of male in","Feto-placental function and applications","Inflammation and Immune modulation","Prostate Cancer"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334011,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Control mechanisms of reproductive processes","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Euan Wallace","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334011","simplified_title":"Control mechanisms of reproductive processes","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"4797204.49","source_system":"This Program Grant investigates a number of important reproductive problems that affect the fertility of men, prostate cancer and the way the mother nurtures and protects the baby during pregnancy. The successful development of sperm requires the proper function of a number of biological processes. This grant investigates the way in which sperm are produced, the genes that are needed to control their development, and the way sperm propel themselves and fertilize the egg. The research also investigates how sperm are protected during their development from infection and immunological rejection, achieved in part by a special environment within the tubes in the testis where they grow. It appears that the general mechanisms that the body uses to combat infections are modified within the testis and the way in which this occurs may provide clues that could be applied to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs in general. Some of the substances that control these processes appear to play an important role in the body�s defense against infection. The grant also investigates the processes that are involved in the development of prostate cancer. These changes can occur over many years and the grant will study some substances that appear to be involved. The work will provide new knowledge that may assist in new tests to identify whether a cancer is slow or fast growing, thereby helping each man to decide the most sensible form of treatment. The grant will investigate how a group of proteins, that also are involved in the control of processes discussed above, assist the mother in protecting her baby during pregnancy. The outcomes will assist in the management of disturbances of pregnancy that may put the fetus at risk of survival."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham

A major obstacle to the rehabilitation of these young people and their return to work or study is their susceptibility to fatigue post-injury. Sleep disturbance is also often reported following TBI and this may accentuate fatigue. Suprisingly, little research has been conducted on the nature, causes or progression of fatigue and sleep disorders following TBI and their possible interrelationships. This study aims to investigate the incidence and extent of fatigue in a large group of people who have experienced a TBI compared to a control group, how fatigue changes over time and its impact on daily life. The study will also address whether higher fatigue levels are associated with decreased attention and speed of information processing. Changes in sleep patterns will also be investigated using both subjective measures, such as sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, and objective physiological measures, such as the time of dim light melatonin onset and polysomnography, comparing the head injured group with controls. The interrelationships between fatigue and sleep changes will then be examined and also their association with injury severity, the location of the brain injury, the time since the injury, age, the presence of any cognitive impairments and the incidence of depression. The project has the potential to provide valuable information to healthcare professionals on the diagnosis of fatigue and sleep disorders in head injury patients. The investigation of the nature, causes and impact of fatigue and sleep disorders could also provide a basis for therapy. For example, fatigue and problems with attention and slowed information processing can be minimized by restructuring lifestyle demands and simple and effective treatments are available for many sleep disturbances, such as bright light therapy and-or exogenous melatonin."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Shantha Rajaratnam","data":{"first_name":"Shantha","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027487","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Rajaratnam","source_individual_id":"RMIS2316500","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Shantha Rajaratnam"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84095","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Richard O'Sullivan","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015385","middle_name":"M","last_name":"O'Sullivan","source_individual_id":"RMIS2316503","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Richard O'Sullivan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80880","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Jennifer Redman","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0009848","middle_name":"","last_name":"Redman","source_individual_id":"RMIS4319947","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jennifer Redman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79374","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennie Ponsford","data":{"first_name":"Jennie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004022","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Ponsford","source_individual_id":"5017020","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jennie Ponsford"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77789","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5985","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"THE INTERFACE BETWEEN INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Allergen-induced inflammation in the respiratory t","Immunology/Allergy","Lung inflammation","Monocyte/macrophage differentiation","Murine models"],"nhmrc_grant_id":334000,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"THE INTERFACE BETWEEN INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Allergy","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Robyn O'Hehir","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334000","simplified_title":"IMMUNE MECHANISMS IN ALLERGY AND ASTHMA","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"4905419.95","source_system":"Allergic disorders including asthma are amongst the most prevalent diseases in Australia afflicting up to 25% of the population and costing the Australian Government in excess of $600 million annually.

Every year in Australia, about 2,000 new individuals commence dialysis and require ongoing treatment for the rest of their lives. The significant negative impact kidney failure has on quality of life and on life expectancy added to the major shortage of transplant organs, makes the development of effective therapies for kidney diseases an important goal. Our current therapies have major limitations in terms of their effectiveness and side effects. New therapies which can prevent the progression of kidney disease or prolong the survival of transplanted kidneys may, therefore, have enormous benefits. In order for this to occur, an improved understanding of the common factors underlying kidney disease is required. Our recent studies have been examining the factors influencing kidney inflammation. This process is a significant cause of long term damage in various kidney diseases and in kidney transplants. Our work has identified a potentially major role for recently discovered molecules known as Slit proteins in preventing or decreasing inflammation in the kidney. The level of expression of these molecules in the kidney appears to be rapidly decreased in kidney inflammation and their protective effect is then lost. This imbalance appears to promote the disease process and may be a useful target for the treatment of certain kidney diseases. Our work has found that Slit proteins are able to decrease the movement of white cells (the cells which cause inflammation) out of the blood circulation and into the kidney. The proposed studies aim to better understand the role of these molecules in the kidney as naturally expressed anti-inflammatory agents and to test their potential as therapeutic agents. We hope that the information obtained from these studies will help in the development of new therapies to manage various forms of kidney disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Kanellis","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031667","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kanellis","source_individual_id":"5015602","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr John Kanellis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85198","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5818","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular interactions of the tetraspanins CD37, TSSC6 and CD151 in T cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["T cell","leucocyte cell surface molecule","tetraspanin"],"nhmrc_grant_id":315405,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cell adhesion molecule","immune system","immunity"],"scientific_title":"Molecular interactions of the tetraspanins CD37, TSSC6 and CD151 in T cells","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Mark Wright","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/315405","simplified_title":"CD37, TSSC6 and CD151 in T cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"566575","source_system":"The tetraspanins are a new type of protein that are found at the surface of cells. Cells of the immune system, such as white blood cells, display at their surface, up to 20 different tetraspanin proteins. However, the precise contributions of these tetraspanin proteins to immunity is still not clear, nor is it clear exactly how tetraspanin proteins differ from one another and why white blood cells need to display so many different tetraspanins. Using genetic technology we have created mice which are unable to express certain individual tetraspanin proteins at their cell surface. Excitingly, the immune systems of these mice are not normal, in particular one type of white blood cell, the T cell responds in an exaggerated manner to stimulation. These results suggest a role for tetraspanins in the control and regulation of the immune system. This project will extend these results and work out the precise molecular mechanism by which the tetraspanins exert this control. In the future, a full understanding of how tetraspanins control T cells may ultimately lead to novel ways of controlling the immune system."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Mark Wright","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023101","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Wright","source_individual_id":"5018485","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Mark Wright"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82952","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Hogarth","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007929","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"Hogarth","source_individual_id":"RMIS5351508","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Hogarth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78842","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Denise Jackson","data":{"first_name":"Denise","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002395","middle_name":"Edna","last_name":"Jackson","source_individual_id":"RMIS10049","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Denise Jackson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77324","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5816","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Multi-centre randomised trial of early decompressive craniectomy in patients with severe traumatic brain injury","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["clinical research","intensive care","neurosurgery","traumatic brain injury"],"nhmrc_grant_id":314502,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["intensive care","neurosurgery","trauma","traumatic brain injury"],"scientific_title":"Multi-centre randomised trial of early decompressive craniectomy in patients with severe traumatic brain injury","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Intensive Care","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof James Cooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/314502","simplified_title":"Decompressive craniectomy in brain injury (DECRA)","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"490500","source_system":"Despite optimal neurosurgical and intensive care therapy, many trauma patients with severe brain injury (typically young males) have very poor long term neurological outcomes. Current knowledge suggests that a key contributor to secondary brain damage which occurs after injury and to poor neurological outcomes is brain swelling and subsequent increase in brain pressure. Present intensive care therapies to control brain pressure are often not effective, and favourable neurological outcomes occur in only 20-30% of these patients. Small studies suggest that a surgical operation called decompressive craniectomy (DC) may decrease brain pressure and improve neurological outcomes in these patients. DC involves temporarily surgically removing a piece of skull bone (during the swelling period) and replacing it when the swelling has subsided. DC is done under general anaesthetic in unconscious patients and is used occasionally at present, although due to insufficient research the benefits are controversial. The proposed study is a multi-centre randomised controlled study of best current therapies plus early decompressive craniectomy vs best current therapies alone in selected unconscious patients with severe head injury. The study outcome is patient neurological function measured 6 months after the injury. A study of this type is required before early DC could become a routine therapy in Australia. Next of kin will sign informed consent for the study and then also for the surgery if patients are randomised to surgery. The study will be managed at the Alfred Hospital-Monash University in Melbourne and includes fifteen collaborating ANZ neurotrauma centres over 3.0 years. There are >200 patients in Australia annually in this category with potential for DC to increase favourable outcomes in >40 patients annually. Lifetime costs for these patients with severe disability are > $2.4 million, so there may be substantial economic and social impact."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Kossmann","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037829","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Kossmann","source_individual_id":"RMIS1649918","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Kossmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86798","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeffrey Rosenfeld","data":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021809","middle_name":"V","last_name":"Rosenfeld","source_individual_id":"5017248","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jeffrey Rosenfeld"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82611","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Peter Reilly","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0021668","middle_name":"","last_name":"Reilly","source_individual_id":"RMIS11129","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Peter Reilly"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82574","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Cooper","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018392","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Cooper","source_individual_id":"5012505","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Cooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81709","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rory Wolfe","data":{"first_name":"Rory","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011139","middle_name":"St.John","last_name":"Wolfe","source_individual_id":"5018441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rory Wolfe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79728","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5814","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"CCRE in Circulatory and Associated Conditions in Urban Indigenous Peoples","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health","Capacity Building","Chronic disease management","Disease prevention","Heart and other chronic disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":264618,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"CCRE in Circulatory and Associated Conditions in Urban Indigenous Peoples","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Indigenous Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Brian Oldenburg","higher_grant_type":"Centre for Research Excellence","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/264618","simplified_title":"CCRE in Circulatory and Associated Conditions in Urban Indigenous Peoples","sub_type":"Centre of Clinical Research Excellence","total_budget":"2157075","source_system":"This Centre will focus on improving the prevention and management of circulatory and associated diseases in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in urban areas.

Vision occurs by interactions between blood vessels, neurons (cells that transmit electrical signals for vision) and glia (cells that support the retina). In diabetes, high amounts of glucose in blood increases certain factors within retinal cells. These factors slowly cause damage, such that after 15 years of diabetes all patients will have some retinal disease and many will loose sight. Indeed, diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working people. The main treatment for diabetic retinal disease is to burn away damaged blood vessels, however, this treatment has problems. Firstly, the burns destroy healthy retina and the disease continues, secondly, the treatment is performed late in the disease and therefore does not prevent the early changes in retinal cells, and thirdly, changes in neurons and glia are often not considered. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand how blood vessels, neurons and glia interact with each other to threaten vision in diabetes, with the intention of developing safer and more effective treatments. This will be the focus of the current project. Currently, there are no studies that have examined the sequential changes in retinal blood vessels, neurons and glia in diabetes. This is mainly due to the lack of an experimental rodent model that progresses from mild to severe diabetic retinal disease. In 2003, we established such a model in the diabetic Ren-2 rat. In this project the diabetic Ren-2 rat will be used to study retinal cell changes and also to identify the factors that damage these cells. We suggest that angiotensin, bradykinin and VEGF are involved. These factors are present in the normal retina and are increased in diabetes. We will block these factors with specific drugs with the intention of understanding how these factors affect retinal cells in diabetes, and also to develop new drug therapies for the treatment of both early and late diabetic retinal disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Wilkinson-Berka","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040458","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Wilkinson-Berka","source_individual_id":"5018315","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Wilkinson-Berka"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87484","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Erica Fletcher","data":{"first_name":"Erica","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024854","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Fletcher","source_individual_id":"5014637","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Erica Fletcher"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83391","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5362","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding and biological actions of IGF binding protein-6","data":{"media_summary":"Mutagenesis","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Apoptosis","Binding protein","Insulin-like growth factors","Proliferation","Structure-activity relationships"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299960,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Endocrine therapy","Growth factor regulation","Growth factors","Microarrays","Mutagenesis"],"scientific_title":"Determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding and biological actions of IGF binding protein-6","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Leon Bach","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/299960","simplified_title":"How do different parts of a protein work?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"399750","source_system":"Proteins are complex structures usually consisting of a number of distinct regions.

The study aims to increase our understanding of how people live with particular diseases and health conditions, the impact of these conditions on body image, self-esteem, social relationships and societal participation, and how structural, contextual and environmental factors affect individual functioning and disability. By including people of different gender, ethnicity, age and area of residence, the study is concerned with how life circumstances and socialization (including ideas of gender) influence outcome. The findings will contribute to our knowledge of adaptation and provide information relevant to improved care for people from different backgrounds. The study is significant because of the increase in chronic disease (relative to infectious disease) in contemporary industrialised societies, particularly with an aging population. The policy context of this work is government interest in maximising the independence and wellbeing of people who are aged and-or with chronic disease, while minimising the economic costs. The research is also significant to international agencies and consumer organisations concerned with reducing discrimination against and inequality of people with impairments.

Glucocorticoids improve lung maturation yet their exact detailed role is not fully understood. Other systemic hormones and factors , such as vitamin A (precursor for retinoic acid) are also important in regulating, completing and maintaining proper lung development and function. Vitamin A deficiency alters lung structure and function, and is believed to be a causal factor in chronic lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, frequently problematic to infants. Detailed understanding of how these hormones work in the lung is critical to the future improvement of treatments for respiratory distress at birth and other respiratory conditions (emphysema, asthma) during adult life. We have developed a number of mouse models to study how these hormones work in the lung and allows us to perform investigations not possible in the human system. Using these mouse models of hormone resistance for glucocorticoids, retinoic acid (vitamin A) and cAMP signaling we will study in detail how these hormones work in the developing lung. Outcomes will be detailed knowledge and mechanisms of action that are critical for the design and testing of novel agents and therapies for immature lungs at birth and in adult lung dysfunction and disease"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Timothy Cole","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024191","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Cole","source_individual_id":"5014013","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Timothy Cole"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83211","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Richard Mollard","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0003451","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mollard","source_individual_id":"RMIS2336690","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Richard Mollard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77623","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5344","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular mechanisms underlying G protein coupled receptor signaling","data":{"media_summary":"Pharmacological intervention","end_year":2007,"keywords":["G Protein-Coupled Receptors","G protein","Molecular Pharmacology","Resonance energy transfer","Signal Transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299811,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Biochemistry and molecular biology","Cardiovascular and other disease preventions","Cell signaling","Neurological disease","Pharmacological intervention"],"scientific_title":"Molecular mechanisms underlying G protein coupled receptor signaling","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Patrick Sexton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/299811","simplified_title":"How do GPCRs signal?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"596956.25","source_system":"The maintenance of optimum health and function of living cells, and consequently that of the whole organism, depends on how cells respond to a multitude of physical and chemical stimuli that continually bombard them.

To make this process even more complex, it was recently shown that another newly discovered group of proteins called receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) too play a critical role in some systems. We have shown that RAMPs interact with many G protein-coupled receptors and that they have a wider range of actions than has previously been appreciated. Moreover, it has been shown that the RAMP-receptor interface is a viable target for drug development. Understanding the extent to which RAMPs interact with G protein-coupled receptors, how they interact with the receptors and the consequences of this interaction forms the basis of the current proposal. Such knowledge is central to the unraveling of the processes involved in the maintenance of health, abnormalities that lead to disease, and in the development of new treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Nandasena Tilakaratne","data":{"first_name":"Nandasena","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045865","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tilakaratne","source_individual_id":"RMIS2438336","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Nandasena Tilakaratne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88865","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Patrick Sexton","data":{"first_name":"Patrick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022037","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Sexton","source_individual_id":"RMIS5568","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Patrick Sexton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82677","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roger Summers","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016511","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Summers","source_individual_id":"5017774","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Roger Summers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81186","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Arthur Christopoulos","data":{"first_name":"Arthur","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006587","middle_name":"","last_name":"Christopoulos","source_individual_id":"RMIS408185","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Arthur Christopoulos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78492","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5329","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Assembly functions of respiratory syncytial virus matrix protein","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["envelope glycoprotein","matrix proteins","replication","respiratory syncytial virus","virus assembly"],"nhmrc_grant_id":292900,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["asthma","otitis media","pneumonia"],"scientific_title":"Assembly functions of respiratory syncytial virus matrix protein","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof John Mills","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/292900","simplified_title":"How respiratory syncytial virus replicates in cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"239250","source_system":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important cause of lower respiratory infections (pneumonia and bronchiolitis) in young infants. In addition to the morbidity of RSV infection itself, it is well established that symptomatic RSV infection in infancy predisposes to asthma later in life. As all infants are infected by RSV at least once by age 2 yrs, this virus represents a major public health problem. Additionally, re-infection by RSV is increasingly being recognized as a cause of severe lower respiratory disease in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients. The goal of this research is to understand better the mechanisms used by RSV to replicate itself in mammalian cells. Information from this work could be used to design novel antiviral drugs to treat RSV, and novel attenuating mutations that may assist in developing live RSV vaccines. The research focuses on a key viral protein, the matrix (M) protein, which is involved in many steps in virus replication. We aim to understand how M protein interacts with other components of the virus (specifically, envelope proteins) to orchestrate virus assembly. To coordinate assembly of new virus particles, M protein binds to portions of virus envelope glycoproteins and to RSV nucleocapsids (the internal machinery of the virus), bringing them together at the cell membrane. The protein-protein interactions which are responsible for these functions of RSV M protein will be determined."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mills","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003417","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mills","source_individual_id":"RMIS133762","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mills"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77612","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5248","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neuroendocrine mechanisms by which leptin regulates reproduction","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["control of gonadotropin releasing hormone release","hypothalamic neuropeptide regulation","leptin action on the brain","metabolic control of reproduction","neuroendocrinology of reproduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":289303,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["brain sensing of metabolic status","control of reproduction","effect on reproduction of drugs for weight control","effects of alteration in body weight"],"scientific_title":"Neuroendocrine mechanisms by which leptin regulates reproduction","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Iain Clarke","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/289303","simplified_title":"Leptin and Reproduction","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"447750","source_system":"The reproductive system is sensitive to alterations in body weight. In particular, low body weight causes the reproductive system to cease functioning. This is because the brain 'senses' metabolic status and responds by ceasing to secrete the brain hormone that drives the reproductive process. This hormone is gonadotropin releasing hormone that acts on the pituitary gland to control the release of gonadotropins. These, in turn, act on the gonads. How the brain perceives metabolic status is not known. Leptin is a hormone that is produced by fat and acts on the brain. This appears to be one of the means by which the reproductive system is regulated. Leptin also regulates food intake and other brain processes. Leptin acts on specific cell types in the brain. Some of these may have dual function to regulated appetite as well as reproduction. The present proposal is for work to determine mechanisms within the brain that are altered by leptin. We will also determine which specific mechanisms relate to the regulation of gonadotropin releasing hormone. The work will provide information on how putative appetite regulators might affect the reproductive axis. Such work will provide a platform for design of pharmaceutical means to manipulate the reproductive axis and will impact on the design of drugs that regulate obesity. It is possible that drugs that developed to control obesity may affect the reproductive axis and the project will identify these."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Iain

They are becoming important for the rapid and reliable measurement of the concentrations of molecules in fluids. In human medicine they will be of great use to general practitioners and patients for instantaneous read outs of concentrations of many different biological molecules. How well a biosensor responds depends on the method in which the biomolecule is immobilised to a surface and the signal detected. We have made a significant advance in biosensing capabilities using a recombinant protein (thioredoxin) and demonstrated the improvement that is possible by (i) immobilising the protein in a highly oriented way and (ii) using a sensitive electrical signal to monitor the response. Here we will undertake more comprehensive testing by extending the number of proteins to include the 4 major classes of redox-sensitive biomolecules (proteins) in the body. This will enable us to establish the broad application of our methods and substantially improve our ability to commercialize our discoveries."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Lisandra Martin","data":{"first_name":"Lisandra","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044049","middle_name":"","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"5016233","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Lisandra Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88416","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers","data":{"first_name":"Raymond","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027648","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Rodgers","source_individual_id":"5017235","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84138","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5151","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of chimeric hepatitis B virus like particles as a vaccine delivery platform for multiple HIV-1 epitopes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["HIV/AIDS","Hepatitis B","Vaccine Development","Viral immunity","Virus-like particle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284420,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Development of chimeric hepatitis B virus like particles as a vaccine delivery platform for multiple HIV-1 epitopes","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Hans Netter","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284420","simplified_title":"Multi-component vaccine for the delivery of HIV-1 antigens","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"139500","source_system":"The small envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) can self-assemble into highly organised viruslike particles with about 150 HBsAg-proteins forming a virus-like particle (VLP). VLPs induce an effective immune response, mainly against the exposed major antigenic site, the hydrophilic �a�- determinant region. To create a novel HBsAg-specific vaccine vector, foreign epitopes were inserted into the major antigenic site allowing surface orientation of the inserted sequence. Pilot studies involving the vaccination of mice with VLPs containing an epitope derived from the AIDS-virus (human immunodeficiency virus 1, HIV-1) or various hepatitis C virus-specific epitopes resulted in high titre antibody responses. This project aims for the development of a multi-component vaccine targeting a non-structural HIV-1 protein and therefore, avoiding the selective pressure directed against the structural proteins. The non-structural HIV-1 tat-protein is a multi-functional protein with an extracellular mode to sensitise uninfected cells for HIV-1 infection and to reactivate HIV-1 from quiescently infected cells. The use of eight tat-sequences is sufficient to provide coverage against 99% of HIV-1 sequences. We will develop hybrid particles that are composed of different sets of chimeric HBsAg proteins each containing a distinct tat-epitope. With this application, we aim to develop hybrid particles for the delivery of the complete set of tat-epitopes. The hybrid particles will be used for vaccination studies in mice, and the antibodies assessed by an in-vitro assay. This will lead to the development of a therapeutic and-or prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine, which could be used either for mass immunisation or in support of combination drug therapy and would have all the cost and production advantages of the widely used hepatitis B vaccine."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Hans Netter","data":{"first_name":"Hans","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032826","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Netter","source_individual_id":"5016677","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Hans Netter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85500","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Roderick Macfarlan","data":{"first_name":"Roderick","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014592","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Macfarlan","source_individual_id":"RMIS2379265","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Roderick Macfarlan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80646","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5150","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Stage II in the development of Eph/ephrin based tumor targeting reagents: Optimisation of drug efficacy and delivery","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Anti-cancer drugs","Cancer: mechanism of growth, invasion, metastasis","Drug design","Membrane Protein","melanoma"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284418,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Stage II in the development of Eph/ephrin based tumor targeting reagents: Optimisation of drug efficacy and delivery","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284418","simplified_title":"Optimisation of drug efficacy and delivery of two anti-tumor proteins targeting metastatic cancer","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"204125","source_system":"In the final stage of cancer, including melanoma, tumor cells gain the ability to spread, a process called metastasis.

Coincidently, there are dramatic developmental changes in the infant's heart and blood pressure control systems, and the ability to compensate for stress such as falls of blood pressure (hypotension) or in the level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxaemia). In infants born preterm, the risks of hypoxaemia, and even death are significantly greater during sleep than during wakefulness, but why this is so is uncertain. This study will examine the ability of infants to respond to stress during sleep. Four groups of infants will be examined: healthy infants born at normal gestation; healthy infants born prematurely (preterm); preterm infants who have experienced mild hypoxaemia soon after birth; and preterm infants who have suffered more severe hypoxaemia because of lung disease. Infants will be studied in a sleep laboratory during day-time sleep, and their ability to control blood pressure will be determined. By contrasting the effectiveness of blood pressure control between the infant groups we aim to determine whether preterm infants have lasting problems as a result of their premature birth, or their exposure to hypoxaemia. By contrasting infants in sleep and wakefulness, we aim to assess whether the risks of poorer blood pressure control are greater in sleep."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rosemary Horne","data":{"first_name":"Rosemary","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013739","middle_name":"Sc","last_name":"Horne","source_individual_id":"RMIS61341","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rosemary Horne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80402","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Adrian Walker","data":{"first_name":"Adrian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010883","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS59623","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Adrian Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79666","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"C Andrew Ramsden","data":{"first_name":"C Andrew","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0009806","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ramsden","source_individual_id":"RMIS5909669","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"C Andrew Ramsden"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79360","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5132","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Efficacy and safety of vertebroplasty for treatment of painful osteoporotic spinal fractures: a randomised trial","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["evidence-based clinical practice","osteoporosis","randomised controlled trial","vertebral fractures","vertebroplasty"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284354,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["disease specific quality of life","diseases of ageing","economic evaluation","fracture repair"],"scientific_title":"Efficacy and safety of vertebroplasty for treatment of painful osteoporotic spinal fractures: a randomised trial","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Rachelle Buchbinder","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284354","simplified_title":"A clinical trial of vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic spinal fractures","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"586250","source_system":"Painful spinal or vertebral fractures are a substantial and growing public health problem and are a burden on the health care system. In Australia, 20-25% of women and 15-20% of men over the age of 50 will develop one or more fractures of their spine in their lifetime. Up to a half of these fractures will result in severe pain and disability. While the fractures generally heal within weeks or a few months, some are so painful that they require narcotic pain control, hospitalisation, and-or long-term nursing home care. Other problems include chronic pain, spinal deformities, loss of height and mobility and restricted breathing. Vertebroplasty is a new procedure consisting of injection of a type of 'bone cement' into the vertebrae to mend the break. It is an exciting treatment because for some people, this results in an immediate and sustained improvement in pain. Although rare, complications such as rib fracture, cement leakage and fractures in other vertebrae do occur. One particular concern is that the mechanical changes to the spine caused by the bone cement may cause long-term complications such as an increased risk of future fractures of treated or adjacent vertebrae. So far, there is very little evidence of the efficacy and safety of this new technology. Importantly, it has not been compared with usual medical care for fractures. In medical research it can be difficult to properly evaluate an exciting and 'apparently' effective treatment that doctors and patients demand. The main aim of this project is to determine whether vertebroplasty is an effective and safe treatment compared to usual medical care. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate vertebroplasty through a strong collaborative effort between the 3 centres currently offering this procedure in Melbourne. If vertebroplasty can be demonstrated to be an effective, safe and cost-effective treatment for painful osteoporotic spinal fractures this will be a valuable addition to current treatment options."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr David Connell","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024225","middle_name":"Alister","last_name":"Connell","source_individual_id":"RMIS2329261","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr David Connell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83221","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Osborne","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021279","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Osborne","source_individual_id":"5016820","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Richard Osborne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82462","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Graves","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013317","middle_name":"Ellis","last_name":"Graves","source_individual_id":"RMIS156078","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Graves"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80300","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rachelle Buchbinder","data":{"first_name":"Rachelle","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006298","middle_name":"","last_name":"Buchbinder","source_individual_id":"5013671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rachelle Buchbinder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78418","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Wark","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005312","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Wark","source_individual_id":"RMIS47887","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Wark"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78150","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Ebeling","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001410","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Ebeling","source_individual_id":"5012583","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Ebeling"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77063","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5131","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Towards reducing resistance and haematological toxicity of linezolid","data":{"media_summary":"Severely ill patients","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics","Antimicrobial pharmacokinetics","Antimicrobial resistance","Antimicrobial toxicity and toxicodynamics","Optimising antimicrobial dosage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284347,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Adverse drug reactions and toxicity","Antimicrobial resistance","Final therapeutic option","Multidrug-resistant bacterial infections","Severely ill patients"],"scientific_title":"Towards reducing resistance and haematological toxicity of linezolid","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Craig Rayner","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284347","simplified_title":"Ways of improving the use of a last-line antibiotic","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"135825","source_system":"Multi-drug resistance in bacteria is increasing at an alarming rate.

In addition, with broader use of this drug outside clinical trials, there has been an increasing concern over its toxicity to important blood cells.

In addition to mortality, there is a high morbidity rate and quality adjusted life-years lost from injury is vast. In broad terms, major trauma is defined as those injuries with the highest severity, requiring time critical medical care. Over 10% of major trauma patients have a severe head injury and approximately 40% of these patients die and another 40% have significant long-term morbidity. Following severe head injury, it is common for patients to have decreased oxygen levels and this is associated with a significant increase in brain damage. To prevent or treat this, patients with severe head injury require endotracheal intubation (a tube is placed in the airway to provide oxygen to the patient) as soon as possible following injury. However, in most patients with severe head injury, endotracheal intubation requires the use of drugs to facilitate placement of the endotracheal tube. The usual technique involves the administration of both a sedative drug and an appropriate muscle-relaxant. This technique is known as rapid sequence intubation (RSI). However, it is unknown whether RSI should be undertaken by paramedics early after injury or be delayed until arrival at the hospital. Since better evidence of improved outcome is required to justify the possible risk and considerable expense of training ambulance paramedics in the skill of RSI, it is proposed that a randomized, controlled trial of RSI in adults with severe head injury be conducted.

It is rapidly replaced with a new functional lining that grows from the basal layer that remains. In post menopausal women, who only have the thin basal layer of the uterine lining, there is rapid regeneration of the lining when they commence hormone replacement therapy. Despite this remarkable regenerative capacity of the uterine lining, nothing is known about the precursor cells responsible for its cyclical growth. Our preliminary studies have shown that the human uterine lining contains a rare population of cells with high proliferative capacity. This project will identify, characterize and locate these precursor cells in the human uterine lining. It also aims to obtain information on how these precursor cells function in regenerating the uterine lining, how they interact with sex hormones and how their proliferative activity is regulated. Information generated from this project will provide significant new insight into the functioning of the uterine lining. It also has immediate application to common gynaecological diseases associated with abnormal growth of the uterine lining, such as endometriosis, a disease which affects 10% of reproductive age women causing pain and infertility. A better understanding of how these precursor cells may be involved in endometriosis and other gynaecological diseases may ultimately lead to the development of improved medical treatments rather than surgical intervention, which is currently the main form of treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Caroline Gargett","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019141","middle_name":"Eve","last_name":"Gargett","source_individual_id":"5014766","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Caroline Gargett"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81884","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5127","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Anti-Estrogens - A Potential Treatment for Bipolar Affective Disorder in Women?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Bipolar disorder","Mood disorder","Progesterone","Protein kinase C","Tamoxifen"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284319,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Bipolar affective disorder","Hormone therapy in women","Women's mental health"],"scientific_title":"Anti-Estrogens - A Potential Treatment for Bipolar Affective Disorder in Women?","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Jayashri Kulkarni","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284319","simplified_title":"Anti-Estrogens - A Potential Treatment for Bipolar Affective Disorder in Women?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"239250","source_system":"Bipolar Affective Disorder (BPAD) or Manic-Depressive Illness is a serious mental illness with high morbidity and mortality. The cause of the illness is still unclear and the underlying neurochemical changes are different for the manic phase compared with the depressive phase. The current treatments for BPAD are limited in scope and not biochemically well understood. There are gender differences in the presentation and outcomes for BPAD which adds to the complexity of the illness. We are proposing a study to develop a new type of treatment for the manic phase of BPAD and are exploring the use of anti-estrogens in women with mania. The background to our proposed study comes from a few case reports suggesting that anti-estrogen agents such as progesterone and tamoxifen may be useful adjuncts to treatment. We conducted a small pilot study comparing the addition of oral tamoxifen with oral progesterone and placebo in 10 women with mania and found that the women who received tamoxifen made significantly better improvements in their manic symptoms over a 28-day trial. The research study we are now proposing is a larger, three-arm, double blind, placebo controlled, 28-day adjunctive study in women with mania to expand and clarify our pilot study findings. Patients in our proposed study would receive either 40mg per day tamoxifen or 20mg per day progesterone or placebo in addition to standardised lithium medication. We will measure enzyme activity (protein kinase C) and estrogen-progesterone levels to understand more about the mechanisms of action by these new hormone treatments. BPAD is a crippling disorder and if we are successful, then tamoxifen treatment may be an important new treatment. This proposed study will also shed new light on some of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying BPAD as well as opening up the new area of hormone treatments for serious mental illness."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Susan Davis","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036193","middle_name":"Ruth","last_name":"Davis","source_individual_id":"RMIS3046323","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Susan Davis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86385","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jayashri Kulkarni","data":{"first_name":"Jayashri","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002754","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kulkarni","source_individual_id":"RMIS5890425","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jayashri Kulkarni"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77420","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5123","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A parent education and skills training intervention for young adolescents with autism","data":{"media_summary":"parenting","end_year":2006,"keywords":["adolescents","autism","mental health","outcome measurement","parent management strategies"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284303,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["adolescent mental health and adjustment","autism","family functioning","parental mental health","parenting"],"scientific_title":"A parent education and skills training intervention for young adolescents with autism","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Bruce Tonge","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284303","simplified_title":"Education and training for parents of adolescents with autism","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"436500","source_system":"Autism is a most severe and prevalent lifelong developmental disorder affecting approximately one in every thousand children and their families.

This project aims to assess the effectiveness of a parent education and training program for parents with autistic adolescents aged 12-14 years.

WHO projections suggest that by 2020 the burden of depression alone will be second only to cardiovascular disease. New treatments for mental disorders are being developed which must be evaluated. Current research methods do not allow an accurate comparison of the cost effectiveness of these therapies with the cost effectiveness of other medical services as this requires the measurement of 'utility' or 'quality of life'. The small number of 'generic' 'quality of life instruments' developed to date vary significantly in their 'sensitivity' to different illnesses-their ability to detect change-and none is very sensitive to changes in mental health states. The present project is to overcome this deficit. This will be achieved by refining and expanding an instrument developed in Australia, the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) instrument. This is the only instrument to date which was both constructed using correct psychometric principles of instrument construction and which describes health states in terms of the effect upon a patient's ability to function in a social environment. The new instrument called the PsyQoL will increase instrument sensitivity by including a mental health 'module' to the existing instrument and revising existing items. The methods used will include several methodological innovations in the description of health states and the derivation of utility scores. The project will include a large scale 'validation' study which will include the construction of population 'norms' and also the creation of 'exchange rates' between the PsyQoL and other instrument scores. The significance of the project is that the PsyQoL will allow valid and reliable measurement of health states in a way that creates a 'level playing field' between mental and other health related interventions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helen Herrman","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043017","middle_name":"Edith","last_name":"Herrman","source_individual_id":"5012096","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Helen Herrman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88147","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Cathrine Mihalopoulos","data":{"first_name":"Cathrine","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038549","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mihalopoulos","source_individual_id":"5016468","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Cathrine Mihalopoulos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86987","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Graeme Hawthorne","data":{"first_name":"Graeme","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037175","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Hawthorne","source_individual_id":"5015146","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Graeme Hawthorne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86630","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeff Richardson","data":{"first_name":"Jeff","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033415","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Richardson","source_individual_id":"RMIS2990635","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jeff Richardson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85650","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Stuart Peacock","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0021386","middle_name":"","last_name":"Peacock","source_individual_id":"RMIS78936","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Stuart Peacock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82492","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5121","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Changes in motor control and kinaesthetic sensations after eccentric exercise.","data":{"media_summary":"Sports Injury","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Eccentric Exercise","Motor Control","Muscle Fatigue","Musculoskeletal Pain","Proprioception and Kinaesthesia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284278,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Motor Rehabilitation","Muscle Fatigue","Muscle Function Deficits - Loss of Motor Control","Musculoskeletal Injury","Sports Injury"],"scientific_title":"Changes in motor control and kinaesthetic sensations after eccentric exercise.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Uwe Proske","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284278","simplified_title":"The control of movement after exercise.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"287250","source_system":"It is a well-known observation that after a period of intense exercise we are unsteady on our feet and are clumsy when attempting to make precision movements. Such impressions are particularly marked after eccentric exercise, during which the contracting muscles are forcibly lengthened. Activities such as walking downhill, skiing and horse riding involve eccentric exercise. The debilitating consequences of this kind of exercise are attributed, not just to the post-exercise effects of fatigue, but to loss of muscle force from damage to fibres. Eccentric exercise also leads to longer term effects. The breakdown of the damaged tissue leads to sensations of stiffness and soreness the next day. This application proposes experiments aimed at studying a number of effects of eccentric exercise on motor control, and establishing the muscle, spinal and brain levels at which they occur. Three studies are planned. In the first, the question will be explored whether we are less able to use the motor areas of our brains to execute voluntary contractions after exercise. So fatigue is not just a matter of exhausted muscles but perhaps also exhausted brains. We will use brain and spinal cord stimulation to explore this point. Then we plan to listen to single motor units, the basic elements of muscle control, to try to understand the mechanism by which the brain minimises the debilitating effects of fatigue. Finally we want to examine subjects' ability to locate their limbs in space as a means of providing a basis for the clumsiness we experience after intense exercise.

We have characterised the phospholipids that the enzyme cleaves and demonstrated the generation of new cell signals at specific subcellular localizations on intracellular membranes. We predict the generation of these specific lipid signals may play a significant role in controlling the transport of intracellular cargo to specific sites in the cell. In this grant proposal we aim to examine the regulation of specialised cargo called the glucose transporter, which is found in fat and muscle cells, and also the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which regulates the trafficking of specific enzymes which mediate digestion of proteins. These studies include the clarification of which phospholipid signals the enzyme terminates and where in the cell this occurs. Secondly, we will examine the movement of the glucose transporter GLUT-4 in unstimulated cells and in response to insulin and furthermore how expression of the novel enzyme regulates its movement. We will also examine the movement of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the specific phospholipid signals which control the route the receptor traffics, using inhibitors of lipid signals and expression of lipid phosphatases and kinases.

Inherited muscular disorders such as muscular dystrophy and myopathies, cause muscle weakness, which may be profound and lead to premature death due to respiratory muscle failure, or cause mild weakness later in life. The proteins which are defective in these muscular dystrophies are structural muscle proteins, which link and stabilize the contractile fibres in muscle and protect the muscle from the stresses and damage resulting from repeated muscular contraction. We have identified that the FHL proteins, which are the focus of this grant application, bind to and potentially regulate muscle proteins, which have been shown to cause forms of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Examination of these interactions will provide insights into the biological mechanism of these muscle disorders. Furthermore, one of these proteins, FHL1 is significantly increased in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart muscle thickening, a major cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. We are creating transgenic mice, which make increased levels of FHL1 protein in their heart muscle, to determine whether increased FHL1, by itself is sufficient to promote heart muscle thickening. These studies should lead to further understanding of the development of diseases of heart and skeletal muscle, which may lead to novel treatments in the future."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Susan Brown","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012033","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS387354","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Susan Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79953","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5118","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Using evidence to set priorities in health: an analysis of decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee","data":{"media_summary":"value for money from pharmaceuticals","end_year":2005,"keywords":["evidence based decision making","implied value of health","pharmaceutical policy","priority setting"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284270,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["economic cost of poor evidence in medicine","improving the quality of evidence for decision making","threshold values for cost effectiveness analysis","using economic and clinical information for funding health","value for money from pharmaceuticals"],"scientific_title":"Using evidence to set priorities in health: an analysis of decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health Economics","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"ECONOMICS","cia_name":"Prof Anthony Harris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284270","simplified_title":"What has factors explain the decisions of the PBAC to recommend the funding of drugs?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"174575","source_system":"Australia has pioneered the use of rigorous clinical and economic evidence in the evaluation of drugs prior to funding on our nationally subsidised Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In the ten years since the introduction of the requirement that drugs demonstrate cost effectiveness prior to subsidy being granted there has been no formal independent evaluation of the system to assess its performance. This project will examine the recommendations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in the last decade and consider the factors that explain those decisions. At times it has been asserted that those decisions have been arbitrary or based on inappropriate considerations such as the financial cost to government or politics of the day rather than the value for money of the drug in question. We will examine the reasons behind the decisions against the objectives of providing access to life enhancing medicines in a cost effective manner. We will look at what are the key determinants of whether a drug is recommended for listing on the PBS or is rejected. A key focus will be on whether those determinants could be described as legitimate in terms of their consistency with the objectives of the scheme. For example whether the main cause of rejection is a lack of high quality evidence on effectiveness- cost effectiveness or simply because of factors such as the high financial cost to government. The project will create a database of all submissions to the PBAC 1992-2004 that will allow us to explore a number of questions about the effectiveness of the decision making process in using evidence on effectiveness and costs in health more broadly as well as those specific to the PBS. In highlighting some of the problems with the evidence and its interpretation the overall aim is to improve the quality of the decision making process in the future."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Anthony Harris","data":{"first_name":"Anthony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037124","middle_name":"Howard","last_name":"Harris","source_individual_id":"5011907","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Anthony Harris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86610","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Suzanne Hill","data":{"first_name":"Suzanne","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0019622","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hill","source_individual_id":"RMIS3836995","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Suzanne Hill"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81997","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5117","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Assessment of transgenic plants expressing malaria antigens as a means of inducing protective immunity","data":{"media_summary":"Protection against malarial disease","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Immunology","Malaria","Malaria vaccines","Parasitology","Transgenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284269,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Malaria","Malaria vaccine","Oral vaccine","Parasitic disease","Protection against malarial disease"],"scientific_title":"Assessment of transgenic plants expressing malaria antigens as a means of inducing protective immunity","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Parasitology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ross COPPEL","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284269","simplified_title":"Oral immunisation against malaria","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"112000","source_system":"Malaria infection of humans is one of the most important and deadly infectious diseases in the world, killing more than two million people each year. Traditionally, drugs and insecticides have been used to treat the disease and control its spread. Unfortunately, both of these have become much less effective and there now exist untreatable cases of malaria. Alternative control measures are urgently needed and this project focusses on the development of such an alternative, a vaccine against malaria using plants transgenic for genes encoding vaccine molecules. Growing these plants not only provides a potentially inexpensive vaccine production system but also offers a potential delivery system such that immunisation may be possible simply through consumption of an edible vaccine. This project intends to investigate the possibility of using transgenic plants expressing malaria antigens to induce protective immunity against malaria infection. The results of this project will provide vitally important information in malaria vaccine production and delivery."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lina Wang","data":{"first_name":"Lina","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0034562","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wang","source_individual_id":"RMIS1017524","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lina Wang"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85956","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Steven Wesselingh","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017040","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Wesselingh","source_individual_id":"RMIS6830026","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Steven Wesselingh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81325","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Coppel","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012469","middle_name":"Leon","last_name":"Coppel","source_individual_id":"RMIS69215","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Coppel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80068","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5116","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["adhesion","glycoproteins","haemostasis and thrombosis","platelets","signalling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284267,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"","cia_name":"Prof Shaun Jackson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284267","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"713750","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shaun Jackson","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037493","middle_name":"Phillip","last_name":"Jackson","source_individual_id":"5011850","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Shaun Jackson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86712","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5115","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigation of mechanotransduction mechanisms in platelets","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["ITAM signalling","Integrin signalling","Mechanotransduction","Platelet adhesion","von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284266,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Artherosclerosis","Haemostasis and thrombosis","Heart attacks and strokes"],"scientific_title":"Investigation of mechanotransduction mechanisms in platelets","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Shaun Jackson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284266","simplified_title":"Mechanotransduction in platelets","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"481500","source_system":"Platelets are extremely important cells that stop bleeding by sticking to injured blood vessel walls, forming blood clots. Excessive clotting can lead to fatal vascular events such as heart attack and stroke. On the other hand, defects in blood clotting can result in life threatening bleeding problems. Platelets stick to sites of vessel wall injury through the interaction between cell surface receptors and sticky materials (proteins) that become exposed to the blood flow when the vessel wall is damaged. The stickiness of platelets is controlled by many proteins (and-or enzymes) inside these blood cells. These proteins transmit messages from platelet receptors on the surface into the cell interior, thereby controlling platelet behaviour. We are in the process of identifying several types of proteins-enzymes which are responsible for controlling platelet stickiness. The studies proposed in this application will provide better understanding of the complicated pathways regulating platelet stickiness and clot formation. The knowledge gained may utimately assist in the design of specific drugs for the prevention and-or treatment of heart attacks and strokes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shaun Jackson","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037493","middle_name":"Phillip","last_name":"Jackson","source_individual_id":"5011850","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Shaun Jackson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86712","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Yuping Yuan","data":{"first_name":"Yuping","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0029017","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yuan","source_individual_id":"RMIS224659","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Yuping Yuan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84525","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5114","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Towards optimising dosing of the 'old' antibiotic colistin methanesulphonate: enhancing efficacy and reducing resistance","data":{"media_summary":"Rationalising antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics","Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics of resistance","Antimicrobial pharmacokinetics","Antimicrobial safety and tolerability","Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in dose selection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284265,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Antimicrobial chemotherapy","Diminishing therapeutic options","Infectious diseases","Multidrug resistant bacterial infection","Rationalising antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis"],"scientific_title":"Towards optimising dosing of the 'old' antibiotic colistin methanesulphonate: enhancing efficacy and reducing resistance","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Roger Nation","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284265","simplified_title":"Improving use of an 'old' last-line antibiotic","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"266500","source_system":"The global problem of multidrug-resistant bacteria is a major clinical challenge.

To date, there is no cure for autoimmune diseases. Treatment is designed to treat the destructive effects of the disease. A strategy for achieving a cure is to program the immune system to remove the harmful immune cells. Autoimmune gastritis which leads to pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune disease which affects the acid secreting cells of the stomach. To get a better understanding of autoimmune diseases, animal models are often used. We use a number of mouse models of autoimmune gastritis which closely resembles the human disease and thus makes a very good working model. Using these models we are exploring novel techniques aimed at reversing or curing established disease.

The studies suggest that the public would also take into account, inter alia, a number of other factors, including prognosis, health potential and the social context of the problem. They would not treat program costs in the way economic theory and practice recommends. These issues have been dramatised in the WHO's Evaluation of Health Systems (World Health Report 2000). This assigns a weight of only 0.25 to health improvement and 0.75 to issues of fairness. The proposed study will carry out three tasks. The first is to measure the importance of Australian health-related social preferences which should, potentially, be included in economic evaluation studies. Key values - parameters - including the rate of time preference and the social willingness to pay for an additional year of life will be measured precisely for immediate use. Secondly, the importance of other issues including illness severity, adaptation and prognosis will be tested to determine how these factors should be included in the economic evaluation of health programs. Finally, some general issues related to public versus private funding, egalitarianism and choice will be investigated.

These proteases act to degrade other proteins, mainly in the extracellular space, which in turn allows cells to move around, wounds to close, and blood clots to disappear. The plasminogen activating system is one of the enzyme systems involved in these events. One of the proteases that cleaves plasminogen to its active form, plasmin, is urokinase (u-PA) and the activity of u-PA is regulated by its natural inhibitor called plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2). u-PA is strongly implicated in the progression of metastatic cancer and high levels of PAI-2 relative to u-PA is regularly seen as a positive prognostic indicator for metastatic cancer. In this situation, PAI-2 acts to limit the activity of u-PA thereby restricting the migration potential of the cancer. PAI-2 is unusual because it exists both inside and outside the cell. Outside the cell, PAI-2 acts to inhibit u-PA activity, while inside the cell, PAI-2 also plays a role in the inhibition of cell growth and differentiation. It is therefore important to understand how the production of PAI-2 is regulated in cells. A significant component of PAI-2 regulation occurs post-transcriptionally, particularly at the level of mRNA stability. We have identified some of the proteins that bind to PAI-2 mRNA and influence its longevity in the cell. This project aims to further undertand how these as well as other PAI-2 mRNA binding proteins influence the expression of the PAI-2 gene."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Hong Yu","data":{"first_name":"Hong","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0046483","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yu","source_individual_id":"RMIS428558","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Hong Yu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89040","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Medcalf","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014929","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Medcalf","source_individual_id":"5016415","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Medcalf"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80745","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5110","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"NUCLEAR AND TRANSGOLGI TARGETING AND MEMBRANE INDUCTION BY DENGUE NS5 RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE INTERDOMAIN REGION","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Nonstructural viral proteins","Nuclear targeting signals/nuclear transport machinery","Phosphorylation regulation","TransGolgi targeting","Vesicular Trafficking"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284249,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Apoptosis/Encephalitis","Dengue fever","Flavivirus infection","Vaccination"],"scientific_title":"NUCLEAR AND TRANSGOLGI TARGETING AND MEMBRANE INDUCTION BY DENGUE NS5 RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE INTERDOMAIN REGION","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Jans","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284249","simplified_title":"Subcellular targeting by Dengue NS5 protein","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"450750","source_system":"Dengue virus is the causative agent of a mosquito-borne disease, Dengue fever, relevant to northern Queensland, where antibodies from a previous infection can complex with virus of a different serotype in a subsequent infection, and cause a severe, potentially fatal form of the disease (Dengue haemorrhagic fever-Dengue shock syndrome). The present proposal seeks to further understanding of the role of the dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5, which is essential for viral RNA replication, within the viral infectious cycle. We intend to examine the subcellular targeting properties of a short central region (the interdomain) of NS5, which appears to play multiple roles in targeting to both the perinuclear Golgi-membranes and to the nucleus, as well as in inducing intracellular membranes derived from the Golgi which are the site of viral replication. We will determine how NS5 localisation-membrane induction may differ in insect and primate cells, and attempt to isolate binding partners of NS5 from the nucleus and Golgi compartment of insect and primate cells using various different approaches. Our studies should assist in understanding NS5's critical role in the Dengue infectious cycle, and contribute towards devising new anti-viral strategies such as vaccination and-or therapies targeted at the NS5 interdomain."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Wright","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028945","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Wright","source_individual_id":"RMIS164012","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Wright"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84505","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Jans","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5109","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An event related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of cognitive deficits in Huntington's disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Cognition and Attention Deficits","Experimental Neuropsychology","Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)","Huntington's Disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284247,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Brain Imaging","Huntington's Disease","Movement Disorders","Rate of Disease progression"],"scientific_title":"An event related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of cognitive deficits in Huntington's disease","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Nellie Georgiou-Karistianis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284247","simplified_title":"A brain imaging study of cognitive deficits in Huntington's disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"257550","source_system":"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive disorder clinically characterized by the onset of involuntary jerky movements, impaired voluntary movements, cognitive-attentional deterioration, and psychiatric symptoms.

The aim of this project is to use event related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to correlate structural and functional changes in the brain via the use of various cognitive behavioural measures. In this way we can elucidate what brain areas are responsible for various cognitive functions. In addition, we intend to ascertain how different brain areas decrement in function over time and to determine whether there is a relationship between rate of disease progression, age at onset and certain genetic characteristics.

of high fever and coma. Many of those who die are young children who live in areas of the world where health care is very poor. The effectiveness of drugs that we currently have available to prevent or treat malaria is rapidly reducing and there is no vaccine available to prevent people from catching the disease. Our research is important because in order to make better medicines for malaria we have to get to know more about how the malaria parasite makes people sick. The most vicious form of malaria is caused by a tiny parasite called Plasmodium falciparum that lives inside the red blood cells in our bodies. As these minute parasites grow, they make a lot of major changes to the red blood cells and as a result they become very stiff and sticky. This is very bad for the infected person because instead of flowing around the body like normal red blood cells, the infected cells become trapped in small veins and can no longer do their normal job. The ability of the parasite to redecorate red blood cells and make them stiff and sticky is what makes this type of malaria so dangerous, particularly when red cells get stuck in the brain. The research that we will do here will help us to understand the ways in which the malaria parasite sends out these sticky substances to the walls of red blood cells. Eventually, this will help us to find ways to stop the red blood cells from becoming sticky and prevent so many people from becoming very sick and dying with malaria."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brian Cooke","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024234","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Cooke","source_individual_id":"5014045","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Brian Cooke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83225","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Coppel","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012469","middle_name":"Leon","last_name":"Coppel","source_individual_id":"RMIS69215","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Coppel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80068","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5106","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["cell adhesion","inflammation","platelets","signaling","thrombosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284237,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Interactions (incl.

Alzheimer's disease is a disease of ageing commonly associated with memory loss. The disease is caused by the build up of amyloid protein in the brain. However, it is not known how amyloid protein causes degeneration of normal brain function. Our previous studies have shown that amyloid protein targets two components which are important for normal brain function. These components are 1) acetylcholinesterase and 2) nicotinic receptors, which are known to be important for memory. The aim of this application is to identify the mechanisms by which amyloid protein targets acetylcholinesterase and nicotinic receptors and to design inhibitors of this interaction which may ultimately provide a platform for future drug development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marie-Isabel Aguilar","data":{"first_name":"Marie-Isabel","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023271","middle_name":"","last_name":"Aguilar","source_individual_id":"RMIS5109331","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Marie-Isabel Aguilar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82992","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Small","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010311","middle_name":"Henry","last_name":"Small","source_individual_id":"RMIS33323","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Small"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79505","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mary Collins Chebib","data":{"first_name":"Mary","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000983","middle_name":"","last_name":"Collins Chebib","source_individual_id":"RMIS1605325","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mary Collins Chebib"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76931","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5103","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["cell adhesion","receptors","signal transduction","thrombosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284234,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"","cia_name":"A/Pr Robert Andrews","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284234","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"833601","source_system":"I am a protein chemist-vascular biologist analysing structure, function and clinical role of platelet adhesion receptors regulating patho-physiological thrombus formation associated with thrombotic diseases such as heart attack and stroke."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Robert Andrews","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000108","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Andrews","source_individual_id":"5013212","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Robert Andrews"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76682","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5102","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Proteases, their Inhibitors and receptors in degenerative disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Bioinformatics and structural biology","Protease activated receptors","Proteases and Inhibitors","glycosaminoglycans","serpins and serpinopathies"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284233,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Proteases, their Inhibitors and receptors in degenerative disease","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr James Whisstock","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284233","simplified_title":"Protease Biology","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"5843388.13","source_system":"Many of the themes of this program are aimed at understanding the molecular basis of several important degenerative diseases that in particular affect the ageing population. These include osteoporosis, arthritis, periodontal disease, wasting diseases of muscle and inherited disorders such as antitrypsin deficiency. The five CI�s on this application have formed a collaborative network since 1996. Dr Whisstock is a bioinformatician and structural biologist with a research focus on the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors and their protease partners. He is currently the scientific director of the Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium and an NHMRC Senior Research Fellow. Dr Bird is an NHMRC Senior Research Fellow who discovered the intracellular branch of the serpin superfamily and formulated the hypothesis that describes their function. A-Prof Mackie is a world expert in the field of musculoskeletal biology and pathology. Dr Bottomley is a Senior Logan Fellow and RD Wright Fellow whose research focuses upon how proteins misfold and lead to disease. Dr Pike is an enzymologist whose research area encompasses a wide range of bacterial and mammalian proteases involved in the pathology of human disease. Each individual in this team brings different skills which makes this a very important and powerful collaboration. The research is extensive and involves protein folding, enzyme kinetics, molecular modelling, structural biology, bioinformatics, cell biology and pathology, enzyme kinetics and drug design. Collectively the CI�s have a total of 154 papers since 1998, of which a third include two or more of the CI�s as co-authors. Currently the team holds over >$5 million in grant funding. The team is augmented by four P.I.s: Dr Buckle is a talented structural biologist; Dr Scott is a molecular cell biologist who holds an NHMRC CJ Martin Fellow; Dr Garcia de la Banda is a computer scientist based at Monash and Dr Grigoryev is a world expert in chromatin condensation based at Penn State University (USA)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Whisstock","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040415","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Whisstock","source_individual_id":"5018263","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof James Whisstock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87471","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Eleanor Mackie","data":{"first_name":"Eleanor","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026444","middle_name":"Jean","last_name":"Mackie","source_individual_id":"RMIS43381","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Eleanor Mackie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83837","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Phillip Bird","data":{"first_name":"Phillip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017751","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Bird","source_individual_id":"RMIS46152","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Phillip Bird"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81535","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Pike","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015599","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Pike","source_individual_id":"RMIS39559","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Pike"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80935","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Bottomley","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011912","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Bottomley","source_individual_id":"RMIS39562","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Bottomley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79929","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5101","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of leukocyte trafficking by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["MIF","immune response","inflammatory disease","leukocyte trafficking"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284231,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["autoimmune disease","rheumatoid arthritis","sepsis"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of leukocyte trafficking by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Michelle Leech","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284231","simplified_title":"MIFand leukocyte traffiicking.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"239250","source_system":"The entry of white blood cells in to tissues is a primary event which drives tissue and organ damage in a number of inflammatory and immune mediated conditions. Diseases as diverse as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or shock due to bacterial infection (septic shock) have many different triggers and manifestations. However almost all autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have one common feature: white blood cells must leave the blood and enter tissue in order to cause tissue inflammation and ultimately tissue damage and loss of function. The mechanism whereby white blood cells leave the blood stream and cross blood vessel walls to get into tissues is a multi-step process often referred to as white blood cell trafficking. Most of the current treatments for immune and inflammatory conditions have the primary aim of keeping white blood cells out of tissue in order to prevent damage. Some of these treatments, like steroids (cortisone), are very effective but cannot be used for prolonged periods because of the risk of problems like bone thinning (osteoporosis), high blood pressure or diabetes. Other treatments and immunosuppressive agents can also be effective but are themselves associated with toxicity and risk of organ damage. Although substantial progress has been made in the management of immune and inflammatory conditions in the last 50 years, the current treatment options are far from ideal. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammatory substance released by cells which comprise the blood vessel wall as well as by white blood cells themselves. It is known to contribute to the build up of white blood cells in inflamed tissue. The effect of MIF on white blood cell trafficking has never been examined. Understanding how MIF promotes white cell entry in to tissues could be crucial in our understanding of this important process and blocking MIF may prove to be a useful and effective way to prevent it."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michelle Leech","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037978","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Leech","source_individual_id":"5015904","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Michelle Leech"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86839","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Hickey","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037256","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hickey","source_individual_id":"RMIS571160","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Hickey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86653","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5100","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["cytokine signaling","functional genomics","interferons"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284220,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Paul Hertzog","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284220","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"456812.5","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Hertzog","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013632","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hertzog","source_individual_id":"RMIS8318","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Hertzog"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80373","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5099","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Molecular basis of bacterial infectious diseases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Bacterial pathogens","Immunity to infection","Vaccines","Virulence"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284214,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"The Molecular basis of bacterial infectious diseases","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Infectious Diseases","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Julian Rood","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284214","simplified_title":"How bacteria cause disease in humans","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"16230995.76","source_system":"Bacterial infectious diseases are a serious threat to human health, accounting for over 10 million deaths each year.

Grant","total_budget":"281900","source_system":"A common consequence of a stroke affecting the parietal lobe of the right hemisphere of the brain is a failure to attend to stimuli presented to the left side of the patient. This disorder, called unilateral spatial neglect, affects up to 50% of all stroke sufferers, and poses a significant problem for recovery of function. Neglect has been most widely studied in the modality of vision. Although neglect of auditory stimuli and of stimuli in other modalities has been reported, it has been studied in much less detail, and the relationship between visual and auditory neglect has not been investigated using tasks of similar complexity. One aim of this project is to examine the relationship between auditory and visual neglect using tasks that are carefully matched for complexity and cognitive demands. A second aim relates to the important recent discovery that substantial changes in a visual scene can go unnoticed unless the observer's attention is drawn to them, a phenomenon termed change blindness. The project will examine the ability of normal listeners and of stroke patients to detect changes in complex auditory environments in which sounds arise from multiple sources located in different regions of space. We aim to establish whether there is a change deafness phenomenon analogous to change blindness, and if this is exacerbated in stroke patients with neglect. The results of this project will increase our understanding of the nature of normal auditory attentional processes and of their disruption as a consequence of stroke. The importance of these studies derives from the fact that hearing and attention to auditory stimuli serve a critical role in human communication and as an early warning system for events in the environment that are not within a person's visual field. Increased understanding of disturbances in auditory attention in neglect patients could lead to better rehabilitation of neglect, for which there is currently no effective treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Dexter Irvine","data":{"first_name":"Dexter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025708","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Irvine","source_individual_id":"RMIS8519","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Dexter Irvine"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83618","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jason Mattingley","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020682","middle_name":"Brett","last_name":"Mattingley","source_individual_id":"RMIS123930","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jason Mattingley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82287","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5097","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Genetic and Biochemical Analysis of the PIM/LAM biosynthetic pathway in Mycobacteria.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["gene expression","gene knock-out","lipid biochemistry","microarray","molecular genetics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284209,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Tuberculosis","bacterial pathogen","infectious disease"],"scientific_title":"Genetic and Biochemical Analysis of the PIM/LAM biosynthetic pathway in Mycobacteria.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Infectious Diseases","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ross COPPEL","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284209","simplified_title":"Analysis of Compounds in the Cell Wall of Mycobacteria.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"272250","source_system":"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most devastating diseases in human history. TB kills approximately two millions people each year worldwide, more than any other disease caused by a single infectious agent. The disease has re-emerged in recent years due to the AIDS epidemic and the appearance of TB bacteria that are not killed by currently available antibiotics. New antibiotics must be developed to combat this global health threat. This requires the identification of targets on the bacteria on which antibiotics can act. One particularly attractive target is the outer coat of the bacterium. Several existing antibiotics target the bacterial coat, yet the ways in which coat is assembled are poorly understood. Two related compounds in the bacterial coat, and unique to TB bacteria, are called PIMs and LAMs. The structures of these compounds are known, and the compounds appear to be essential for the survival of the bacteria in the human host. However, the mechanisms by which PIMs and LAMs are made by the bacteria are very poorly understood. The aim of our research proposal is to better understand the process by which these compounds are made. If this process can be blocked by an antibiotic, then this represents a potential anti-TB therapy which could save millions of lives worldwide."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Coppel","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012469","middle_name":"Leon","last_name":"Coppel","source_individual_id":"RMIS69215","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Coppel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80068","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Paul Crellin","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006778","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Crellin","source_individual_id":"5014121","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Paul Crellin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78539","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Von Itzstein","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005229","middle_name":"","last_name":"Von Itzstein","source_individual_id":"5018138","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Mark Von Itzstein"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78121","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5096","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Engineered histones as DNA carriers with application in therapeutic gene delivery","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Biochemistry of protein-DNA complexes","Chromatin and histone variants","Non-viral DNA transfer","Nuclear targeting signals/nuclear transport machinery","Protein engineering"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284205,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Diabetes","Drug targeting","Gene therapy","Inborn errors of metabolism"],"scientific_title":"Engineered histones as DNA carriers with application in therapeutic gene delivery","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Jans","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284205","simplified_title":"Histones as carriers for DNA in gene transfer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"417750","source_system":"We intend to apply our knowledge of protein transport to the nucleus to enhance the delivery of DNA to target cells. This relates to the use of gene therapy to treat genetic defects such as inborn errors of metabolism, where a disease-causing lack-of-function mutation can be overcome by engineering cells within the organism which express, in the necessary quantities and in response to the appropriate regulatory signals, the particular component which is lacking. A limiting factor in gene therapy approaches is the low efficiency of nuclear uptake of introduced DNA, where it has been estimated that < 1% of the DNA taken up is actually expressed. Our proposal seeks to develop approaches to enhance non-viral-mediated gene delivery, in particular by optimising this critical, limiting step of the delivery of exogenous DNA to the nucleus. We intend to apply knowledge from studies of nuclear targeting and chromatin assembly to improve gene transfer technologies. We will build on our work showing that specific signals for nuclear import - nuclear targeting signals (NTSs) - can be used to enhance nuclear gene delivery and expression. Since DNA in the normal cellular context is in the form of chromatin - a specific complex with proteins such as histones - we intend to use reconstituted chromatin as the transfecting DNA, whereby histones engineered to include NTSs and other modular sequence elements will be used. Chromatin should not only enable NTSs and other sequence modules to be linked to the DNA but also protect against nuclease-mediated degradation prior to nuclear entry, condense the DNA to enable more efficient cellular-nuclear entry, and ensure expression of the transfected reporter gene by presenting it to the cell in a physiological context. Our approaches should contribute to bringing gene therapy closer to reality in the clinic."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David

ACE inhibitors have been highly successful in the management of hypertension, are standard therapy following myocardial infarction to delay the development of heart failure, and also reduce the rate of progression of renal disease. Recently, a novel enzyme called ACE2 has been discovered in the heart and kidneys. Unlike ACE, ACE2 causes the formation of the vasodilator, Ang 1-7. We have data in the heart and the kidney that supports the concept that ACE2 acts in a counter-regulatory manner to ACE. We suggest that ACE2 may play an important role to modulate the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in the heart and kidney. The studies detailed in this proposal are designed to specifically examine the role and regulation of ACE2 in the healthy heart and kidney as well as in cardiovascular and renal disease. The project brings together two groups with complementary skills and techniques, both of whom have collaborations with the discoverers of ACE2, and who have been exploring the role of ACE2 as evidenced from our recent publication (Tikellis et al, Hypertension in press, 2003)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Louise Burrell","data":{"first_name":"Louise","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041380","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Burrell","source_individual_id":"RMIS151859","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Louise Burrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87729","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alexander Smith","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022186","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"5030684","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alexander Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82720","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Colin Johnston","data":{"first_name":"Colin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019939","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Johnston","source_individual_id":"RMIS430893","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Colin Johnston"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82073","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Rebecca Lew","data":{"first_name":"Rebecca","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0002938","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lew","source_individual_id":"RMIS2293935","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Rebecca Lew"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77484","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Cooper","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001021","middle_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"Cooper","source_individual_id":"5011716","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Mark Cooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76942","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4955","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of Endothelin Converting Enzyme Subcellular Distribution and Vascular Endothelin Production.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Endothelin, Endothelin Converting Enzyme Regulation","Membrane proteins","Vascular Endothelial Cells","Vasoconstriction","phosphorylation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":268913,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Heart Failure","Hypertension","Stroke/subarachnoid haemorrhage"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of Endothelin Converting Enzyme Subcellular Distribution and Vascular Endothelin Production.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Grant","total_budget":"202575","source_system":"Approximately 9.7% of the adult population have an anxiety disorder with one of the more common, panic disorder, often with agoraphobia, afflicting 2.4% of the community. Around 8% of patients consulting a GP also have panic disorder (PD). A further 10% of the community experience spontaneous panic, but do not have full PD (termed non-clinical panic). People with PD frequently experience clinical depression, about 15% abuse alcohol and non-prescription drugs and PD is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Over time people with PD appear to have an increased risk of heart problems. They also have substantial financial burdens through multiple attendances at doctors' rooms and through restricted employment opportunities. Only just over one in four people with an anxiety disorder consults a health professional for their problems, with most going to their GP. It has been estimated that less than 10% of these people seek the services of a mental health specialist such as a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. Therefore because of blocks to do with access, cost or embarrassment, many people with mental health problems do not seek face-to-face specialised mental health treatment. People in rural and regional Australia are particularly disadvantaged by limited access to these specialists. We have developed an internet-based treatment program on panic and anxiety for people in the community, and particularly in regional Australia. Early evaluation of this program has found it is more effective than other types of therapist-assisted self-help treatment. The aim of this research project is to compare it to best-practice face-to-face psychological and pharmacological treatment for PD. If the effectiveness of our internet-based treatment is comparable to best-practice face-to-face treatment, its availability will assist the many Australians who suffer from debilitating panic but who are unable to access specialised mental health assistance."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Litza Kiropoulos","data":{"first_name":"Litza","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0043527","middle_name":"Anthoula","last_name":"Kiropoulos","source_individual_id":"RMIS3376464","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Litza Kiropoulos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88286","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr David Austin","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017518","middle_name":"","last_name":"Austin","source_individual_id":"RMIS3946676","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr David Austin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81468","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Britt Klein","data":{"first_name":"Britt","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014209","middle_name":"","last_name":"Klein","source_individual_id":"5015748","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Britt Klein"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80535","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4425","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Study of the endocrine hypothalamus and the pituitary gland","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Endocrine organs and diseases","Nervous System","Reproductive system"],"nhmrc_grant_id":241004,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Study of the endocrine hypothalamus and the pituitary gland","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Iain Clarke","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/241004","simplified_title":"Study of the endocrine hypothalamus and the pituitary gland","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"633625","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Iain Clarke","data":{"first_name":"Iain","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024151","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Clarke","source_individual_id":"RMIS199493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Iain Clarke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83200","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4300","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigation of inter-cellular calcium communication (ICC) during platelet aggregation and thrombus formation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["inter-cellular calcium communication (ICC)","platelet aggregation","thrombus"],"nhmrc_grant_id":237097,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Investigation of inter-cellular calcium communication (ICC) during platelet aggregation and thrombus formation","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

CIA�s lab has demonstrated the potential importance of MIF in the pathology of chronic inflammation via studies in models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Similarly to other chronic inflammatory diseases, MIF is overexpressed in human RA, and induces activation of key pathological processes in RA cells. Moreover, antagonism of MIF with mAb profoundly inhibits models of RA and other inflammatory diseases, confirming MIF as a therapeutic target in human inflammatory disease. The X-ray crystal structure of MIF has been published and the putative active site fully characterised. We have deduced structural features of MIF that reveal aspects of the structural complementarity of host-guest affinity. This information has been used in the synthesis of new compounds to antagonise MIF.

A sharp tap (impulsive force) is applied to the body wall and the sound radiated in response is observed. This sound may be dull (over liver) or stony dull (pleural effusion), or resonant (over normal lung) or hyper-resonant (over bowel). While the variation in radiated sound is not fully understood, it is apparent that the presence of gas, which is highly compliant, increases mobility of the overlying tissue and allows it to resonate; where the sub-tissue is largely fluid, tissue mobility is low and the percussive sound is dull. Percussion is useful for examining the adult chest and lung, but cannot for example be applied in infant intensive care as only limited impulsive force can be used, and the adult finger, which is both a coupling device and sounding board, is too large. As well, percussion requires skill and quiet conditions. Accordingly, we developed a device to measure mobility of the chest and other tissues in real time. The VibroPulse applies a known low-level force to the body surface and records the resultant velocity induced in the surface. The force is generated by a vibrating mass set in motion by an electromagnetic motor driven by pseudo-random noise. Tissue mobility, defined as velocity-force, is derived simultaneously across the frequency range, providing an easily interpreted quantitative output unaffected by ambient noise. This proposal has two aims we can achieve in 1 year: (1) to continue evaluating VibroPulse sensitivity to tissue composition, using symmetrical percussive sites on the human chest and abdomen that are dull on one side and resonant on the other, and the chest of anaesthetised animals with experimentally induced pneumothorax and lung collapse, two life-threatening conditions for which percussion is a key diagnostic method, and (2) to engineer a small device from our bulky prototype that is suitable for clinical use, in infants and adults."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Philip Berger","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035355","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Berger","source_individual_id":"RMIS981905","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Philip Berger"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86162","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Malcolm Wilkinson","data":{"first_name":"Malcolm","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0034720","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wilkinson","source_individual_id":"RMIS49116","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Malcolm Wilkinson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85994","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"C Andrew Ramsden","data":{"first_name":"C Andrew","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0009806","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ramsden","source_individual_id":"RMIS5909669","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"C Andrew Ramsden"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79360","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4263","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular characterisation of human embryonic and carcinoma stem cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Stem cell biology","cell division","cellular differentiation","foxd3","stem cell therapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":237042,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Molecular characterisation of human embryonic and carcinoma stem cells","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

cortex, are involved in processing visual information. From the anatomical viewpoint, each of these areas should be capable of receiving visual information independently, through parallel anatomical channels involving the brainstem. Yet, it has been observed that lesion of one particular area (the primary visual area, V1) results in loss of vision. This raises several questions. What type of visual information is carried by the parallel pathways to the other visual areas? Why aren t these other areas capable of sustaining vision without V1? Do V1 lesions trigger changes in the adult brain, which affect the other visual areas? As a step towards answering these questions, we will study the neural pathways that convey visual information directly to the middle temporal area (MT). MT is one of the best-characterised visual areas, and the anatomy of its neural inputs is well known, facilitating the interpretation of the results. We will investigate the type of visual information being sent to MT after lesions of V1, as well as the changes in the electrical responses of MT cells which result from this type of condition. This is a basic science study, the primary benefit of which will be advancement of knowledge on the mechanisms that underlie visual processing in normal and pathological situations. However, this type of work may also lay the groundwork for developments in areas of applied research. These may include medicine (e.g. the design of better rehabilitation strategies for people with brain damage), robotics- artificial intelligence (e.g. the development of more robust artificial systems capable of vision), and cognitive sciences (e.g. a better understanding of factors that limit human responses to visual stimuli)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marcello Rosa","data":{"first_name":"Marcello","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033498","middle_name":"G.

Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets undergo a number of internal signalling process and strucural changes that allow them to rapidly adhere to the area of damage. Following this initial adhesion process, platelet-platelet interactions occur leading to the development of a stable blood clot. Our research studies are aimed at understanding more closely the factors that regulate platelet-platelet interactions during the course of blood clot formation, since this is an important determinant not only of normal clot formation, but also in the development of harmful blood clots (thrombi) associated with the onset of diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Our particular focus is on the way in which platelets communicate to one another during the course of platelet thrombus development. Particulary, we are interested in the role of calcium as a signal mediating platelet-platelet communication.

However, the exact role of individual areas remains highly controversial, making detailed physiological and anatomical studies in suitable primate models a key step to elucidating their function in the human brain. We will address one particular aspect of this problem, namely the organisation of the cortical areas that provide visual control for skilled movements. It is proposed that there are two parallel brain circuits involved in the analysis of motion, one tracking the movement of objects, and the other analysing a person s self-motion. Consider, for example, the task of a tennis player who has to return a serve. In order to achieve this, the brain must precisely integrate information about the ball s motion, as well as information about the player s speed and direction. This requires precise control of eye movements (to keep the eyes on the ball), as well as the ability to control the limb and trunk muscles. The aim of this study will be to map the anatomical framework underlying our ability to process all the relevant visual motion information, and to coordinate the appropriate motor responses. Such work is fundamental for understanding the functional organisation of the brain. It also has the potential to lay the groundwork for developments in areas of applied research, including medicine (e.g. the design of better rehabilitation strategies for people with brain damage), robotics- artificial intelligence (e.g. the improvement of artificial systems capable of vision), and the cognitive sciences (e.g. a better understanding of factors that limit human responses to visual stimuli)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marcello Rosa","data":{"first_name":"Marcello","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033498","middle_name":"G.

Despite being around for more than 150 years, there has yet to be a large trial of the safety and benefits of nitrous oxide, particularly when compared with newer (safer?) anaesthetic drugs. Nitrous oxide is not a particularly strong anaesthetic and so it must be mixed with other drugs. Current practice in Australia and around the world is to give 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen along with another anaesthetic gas in order to produce a depth of anaesthesia sufficient for surgery. This is despite knowledge that nitrous oxide interferes with the production of DNA. DNA is used to programme cell division and function - it is the building block of cell and tisue growth. It is known that nitrous oxide can impair some tissue functions, such that anaemia and, possibly birth defects can occur. Such effects are rare, but recent evidence suggests that milder abnormalities may occur more commonly than previously thought. There is also good evidence that nitrous oxide increases the risk of severe nausea and vomiting after surgery. The adverse effects on DNA production raises the possibility of nitrous oxide causing immune deficiency, heart ischaemia, (angina), nerve and spinal cord damage, and increased cancer risk in hospital staff chronically exposed to low levels of nitrous oxide. The prevailing view is that nitrous oxide is a cheap, relatively safe drug that can reduce the exposure to other anaesthetic drugs. However, the development of many new anaesthetic drugs demands a re-evaluation of the role of nitrous oxide in current anaesthetic practice."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Brendan Silbert","data":{"first_name":"Brendan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027954","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Silbert","source_individual_id":"RMIS46686","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Brendan Silbert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84213","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Philip Peyton","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015564","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Peyton","source_individual_id":"5016964","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Philip Peyton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80924","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kate Leslie","data":{"first_name":"Kate","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014431","middle_name":"","last_name":"Leslie","source_individual_id":"5015943","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Kate Leslie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80605","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Paech","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003820","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Paech","source_individual_id":"RMIS223086","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Paech"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77728","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Myles","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003579","middle_name":"","last_name":"Myles","source_individual_id":"5012508","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Paul Myles"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77651","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4244","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of lysosomal proteases by the intracellular serpin, PI-6.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Serpin","cell death","knockout mice","lysosomal cathepsin","serine proteinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236945,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["infection","inflammation","ischaemia"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of lysosomal proteases by the intracellular serpin, PI-6.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Phillip Bird","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236945","simplified_title":"Serpins and cell death","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"152500","source_system":"All cells have a graded response to stress. At low levels of stress, intrinsic systems counter the stressor and repair damage. As stress increases and irreparable damage is likely, affected cells suicide in a pre-programmed manner, and are rapidly engulfed by their neighbours to prevent initiation of a deleterious inflammatory response. Finally, if subjected to overwhelming stress, cells may burst and trigger an inflammatory response. Emerging evidence shows that several organelles in the cell act as stress sensors and participate in initiating programmed cell death. In particular, it appears that degradative enzymes (proteases) released under stress from waste disposal-recycling organelles (lysosomes) can induce death. This may occur in settings such as infection or cardiovascular disease (e.g. stroke). As part of a defence mechanism to counter low level release of these lysosomal proteases, we propose that some cells produce inhibitors called serpins. In preliminary work we have shown that particular serpins do indeed inactivate a subset lysosomal proteases. We propose to study the role of these serpins in protecting cultured cells from stress and the effects of lysosomal protease release. In addition, we will use mice lacking one of these serpins to evaluate its importance in the physiological response to stresses such as bacterial and viral infection, tumor formation and stroke."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Katrina Scarff","data":{"first_name":"Katrina","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033659","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Scarff","source_individual_id":"RMIS1624894","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Katrina Scarff"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85714","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Phillip Bird","data":{"first_name":"Phillip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017751","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Bird","source_individual_id":"RMIS46152","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Phillip Bird"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81535","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4243","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cognition in cerebellar degeneration: correlations with lateral neocerebellar dysfunction and atrophy","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["cerebellar degeneration","cognitive impairment","psychometric testing","volumetric magnetic resonance imaging"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236942,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cerebellar disorders","cognitive impairment","neurogenetics","volumetric magnetic resonance imaging"],"scientific_title":"Cognition in cerebellar degeneration: correlations with lateral neocerebellar dysfunction and atrophy","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Elsdon Storey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236942","simplified_title":"Is the movement coordination centre of the brain also required for flexible thinking?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"205500","source_system":"Diseases of the main brain coordination centre (the cerebellum) were once thought to impair only movement skills.

We will obtain routinely collected air quality data and measure fine particles < 2.5 thousandths of a mm in outdoor air. A subgroup of 100 subjects will also participate in some measurements of indoor air pollution. The analysis will look for relationships between particles in the air, new symptoms and changes in lung function over time.

Reviews commissioned by the National Environment Protection Council have highlighted the lack of Australian data to assist in setting standards for particulate air pollution.

To target efforts in the development of new vaccines and treatments, it is important to identify all the virulence determinants produced by a particular bacterial species, but also to know which are regulated, and the environmental signals that determine their expression. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are two important disease-causing bacteria that exclusively infect humans and cause gonorrhoea, and meningitis. The complete DNA sequence of both of these bacteria is now known. From computer analysis of these data, it appears that these bacteria have few of the specific regulatory systems that are present in other bacteria. Because of the limited repertoire of regulatory systems still present in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, it is feasible to mutate each one and determine which are involved in regulation of virulence determinants. We have made copies of every individual gene found in the DNA sequence of these bacteria and have attached each one individually to a glass slide to form a microarray measuring 18mm x 18mm. This microarray will allow us to monitor the expression of every gene in these bacteria in response to environmental signals. This information will be used to identify all the virulence genes controlled by each regulatory system.

They allow communication between different organs or different parts of the nervous system. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the major group of cell surface receptors that interact with hormones and neurotransmitters. Treatment of many diseases and conditions relies on the use of drugs that selectively activate or block a single type of GPCR. In fact, about 2-3 of existing therapies are based on these drugs. In designing new drugs it is important to understand as much as possible about the properties of the target receptors. There is emerging evidence concerning interactions between drugs, receptors and proteins inside cells that translate signals into responses (signalling proteins). For example, receptors have additional sites of drug action that can modulate their activity, and can also couple to multiple signalling pathways. We are studying adrenoceptors that respond to adrenaline and to the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. Our studies will use adrenoceptors as model systems to identify novel potential sites for drug interaction, to gain new insights into signalling mechanisms utilized by these receptors and to examine how a variety of phosphorylation mechanisms affect the ability of receptors to couple to particular signalling pathways."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roger Summers","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016511","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Summers","source_individual_id":"5017774","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Roger Summers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81186","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Bronwyn Evans","data":{"first_name":"Bronwyn","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012931","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Evans","source_individual_id":"RMIS32283","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Bronwyn Evans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80205","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4237","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Physical determinants of lung development before and after birth","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Fetal lung growth and development","cellular proliferation","lung maturation","neonatal lung growth","premature birth"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236883,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["preterm birth","pulmonary hypoplasia","respiratory insufficiency in the newborn"],"scientific_title":"Physical determinants of lung development before and after birth","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Stuart Hooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236883","simplified_title":"Control of lung growth and development before and after birth","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"442500","source_system":"Survival at birth is critically dependent upon the ability of the lungs to take on the role of exchanging gases; a role previously performed by the placenta. The lungs must, therefore, have grown and matured sufficiently during fetal life, before they are required at the time of birth. Inadequate development of the lungs during fetal life is the most common cause of death and disease in newborn babies. This may be due to premature birth, when the lungs have had insufficient time to develop, or it may be due to inappropriate lung development during fetal life. It is important therefore, to understand the mechanisms that control growth and development of the lung both before and after birth. During fetal life the lungs are filled with liquid which expands the lungs and provides a stretch stimulus causing them to grow. Previously we have shown that a reduction in the degree of fetal lung expansion causes lung growth to cease. Likewise, if we increase the degree of lung expansion in the fetus, we induce a rapid increase in fetal lung growth and maturation. This stimulus is so potent that it can reverse an existing lung growth deficit, thus enabling survival of the newborn. In this application we will investigate the mechanisms by which alterations in lung expansion induce growth and maturation of the lung. Specifically we will investigate the role of calmodulin in fetal lung growth, because the genes that encode it are activated when the lung cells are growing most rapidly. In addition, we will identify other genes that are turned on or off during rapid growth of the lung because those genes are likely to play important roles in the regulation of fetal lung growth and development. We will also investigate the underlying differences in the control of lung growth at different stages of gestation, as well as investigate factors that regulate lung growth after birth, particularly in prematurely born animals."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Megan Wallace","data":{"first_name":"Megan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040295","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Wallace","source_individual_id":"RMIS1016419","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Megan Wallace"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87439","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stuart Hooper","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007960","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Hooper","source_individual_id":"5015309","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stuart Hooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78853","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4236","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Application of epidemiological methods to injury prevention research","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Epidemiology","Injury control"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236880,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Application of epidemiological methods to injury prevention research","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Lesley Day","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236880","simplified_title":"Application of epidemiological methods to injury prevention research","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"706500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lesley Day","data":{"first_name":"Lesley","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036206","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Day","source_individual_id":"RMIS107824","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Lesley Day"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86388","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4235","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomised trial of core cooling versus surface cooling in comatose survivors of prehospital cardiac arrest","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["induced hypothermia","out-of-hospital cardiac arrest","pre-hospital emergency care"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236879,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["anoxic brain injury","neurological recovery","survival from cardiac arrest"],"scientific_title":"A randomised trial of core cooling versus surface cooling in comatose survivors of prehospital cardiac arrest","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

The aetiology of SCA is usually ischaemic heart disease causing ventricular fibrillation (VF). The current medical response to this condition involves a Chain of Survival, including early call to 000, bystander CPR, early defibrillation and early advanced cardiac life support. Following successful cardiac resuscitation, patients are transported to hospital for further care. Despite this approach and recent improvements such as decreased ambulance response times, outcome remains poor and there are very few survivors who make a good recovery. This proposal is for funding to conduct a randomised, controlled trial, which compares two different techniques of induction of hypothermia in patients who are resuscitated from pre-hospital sudden cardiac arrest. Recently available data suggests that the outcome from SCA is significantly improved if moderate hypothermia is used as a treatment of neurological injury. However, the technique of induction of hypothermia requires further research. This study compares core-cooling using large-volume ice-cold intravenous fluid with the current technique of using ice packs for surface cooling, initiated in the field by ambulance paramedics and continued in hospital for a total of 12 hours. This study has the potential to demonstrate a significant improvement in outcome in a common clinical condition, which currently carries a very high mortality rate. This will be the first trial internationally which assess core versus surface cooling initiated pre-hospital, in SCA patients. It is highly likely that with the successful results from this trial that induced hypothermia in SCA patients will become standard care. The use of induced hypothermia could lead to over 500 lives saved per year accross Australia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Taylor","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040012","middle_name":"Mcdonald","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"5017851","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87367","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr William Silvester","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039701","middle_name":"","last_name":"Silvester","source_individual_id":"5034408","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr William Silvester"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87295","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ian Patrick","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0033091","middle_name":"","last_name":"Patrick","source_individual_id":"RMIS1621860","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ian Patrick"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85573","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Anne-Maree Kelly","data":{"first_name":"Anne-Maree","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031708","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kelly","source_individual_id":"RMIS330726","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Anne-Maree Kelly"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85210","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Cooper","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018392","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Cooper","source_individual_id":"5012505","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Cooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81709","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Bernard","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017703","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Bernard","source_individual_id":"5013458","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Bernard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81523","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4234","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An ethical analysis of the disclosure of surgeons' performance data to patients within the informed consent process","data":{"media_summary":"informed consent","end_year":2005,"keywords":["bioethics","competence","decision support techniques","ethical issues","informed consent"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236877,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["bioethics","consumer participation in decision making","decision support techniques","ethical guidelines for professional bodies","informed consent"],"scientific_title":"An ethical analysis of the disclosure of surgeons' performance data to patients within the informed consent process","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Human Bioethics","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Justin Oakley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236877","simplified_title":"The ethics of advising patients about the performance abilities of surgeons","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"148937.5","source_system":"For over a decade, hospitals in the American state of New York have been collecting information about the mortality rates of surgeons conducting Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts, and making this information available to patients.

There are good reasons to think a similar system may be introduced in Australia in the near future. Patients can use the information contained in report cards when deciding whether or not to consent to have a particular surgeon conduct an operation on them. Contemporary bioethicists stress the importance of a proper informed consent process in medicine. This is a process in which a doctor advises a patient of relevant information and ensures that the patient comprehends that information, before the patient consents to an operation. Currently report cards in America are publicly disseminated on the internet, however there is no systematic attempt to incorporate the information contained in report cards into the informed consent process. We do not know if patients understand the information they are given, or if they incorporate it into their decision making procedures appropriately. In our study we will consider how information that is contained in report cards could best be used in the informed consent process. We will keep in mind the importance of helping patients to make their own informed decisions to consent to operations, the importance of respecting the professional integrity of surgeons and the importance of providing the best possible standard of care for patients.

Noise reduction programs are either not always possible or effectively applied. A parallel strategy is the study of biological mechanisms that may ameliorate hearing damage, with a view to optimising such mechanisms. I propose to build on seminal Australian work to examine how one such system, nerves from the brain to the inner ear (the site of most damage from loud sounds), modulates hearing losses caused by loud sounds. Early studies indicated these nerves could protect from damage induced by short-lasting loud sound and this has led to international interest in functional applications of such protection to reduce hearing damage suffered by humans. However, my recent work indicates the nerves exert complex protective and exacerbative effects to loud sounds similar to common trauma or occurring under conditions similar to common trauma. They even exacerbate hearing losses due to loud sound, especially when there is an imbalance in hearing sensitivity in the two ears (bilateral) similar to what is common in humans. These findings make it critical that functional application be delayed until the full range of effects exerted by the nerves is understood. I propose to elucidate the novel complex effects of these nerves to loud sound. Specific aims are: (1) To understand effects of these pathways to loud sounds like those encountered by humans, (2) To investigate how chronic imbalanced bilateral hearing sensitivity, like that common in humans, alters effects of the nerves and when they change from being protective to exacerbative, (3) To adduce how an atraumatic sound affects hearing losses due to later loud sound and the role played by these nerves."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ramesh Rajan","data":{"first_name":"Ramesh","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027485","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rajan","source_individual_id":"5017097","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Ramesh Rajan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84094","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4232","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of endothelial vasodilator mechanisms in cardiovascular control during diabetes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Blood pressure","Endothelium-dependent relaxation","Nitric oxide","Renal circulation","Renal function"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236872,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Diabetes","Endothelial dysfunction","Hypertension","Renal failure"],"scientific_title":"Role of endothelial vasodilator mechanisms in cardiovascular control during diabetes","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Sharyn Fitzgerald","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236872","simplified_title":"Control of blood pressure in diabetes","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"225500","source_system":"Cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack are the greatest killers in developed societies such as Australia.

In many cases, individuals with these risk factors also have high blood pressure, which is a known cause of stroke and heart attack. This seems to be a particular problem in patients with diabetes, a condition that currently affects around 150 million people worldwide. Indeed, almost 70% of patients that develop diabetes in later life, also develop high blood pressure. The aim of the studies outlined in this application is to increase our understanding of the way diabetes affects blood pressure. High blood pressure often accompanies established diabetes, but we have recent evidence that suggests that a gas (nitric oxide) made by the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells) and in nerve cells, protects the cardiovascular system from hypertension during the onset of diabetes. Our experiments will show whether the 'protective' nitric oxide comes from nerves or the endothelial cells, and how it affects various blood pressure control mechanisms in diabetes. Our experiments will also show whether this protective action of nitric oxide is eventually lost as the organ damage that occurs in diabetes proceeds. This information should help in the design of new drug treatments and other therapies aimed at reducing the occurrence of high blood pressure, and hence cardiovascular disease, in diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helena Parkington","data":{"first_name":"Helena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044715","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Parkington","source_individual_id":"5016864","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Helena Parkington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88566","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Sharyn Fitzgerald","data":{"first_name":"Sharyn","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0019011","middle_name":"","last_name":"Fitzgerald","source_individual_id":"RMIS1663108","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Sharyn Fitzgerald"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81860","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Roger Evans","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018903","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Evans","source_individual_id":"5011298","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Roger Evans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81839","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4231","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation and function of the protein tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP in mitosis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["cell cycle","mitosis","protein tyrosine phosphatase","signal transduction","tyrosine phosphorylation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236870,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cancer","cell cycle regulation","cell signalling"],"scientific_title":"Regulation and function of the protein tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP in mitosis","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Tony Tiganis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236870","simplified_title":"Regulation of cell division","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"455250","source_system":"The cell cycle is a universal process by which cells reproduce and it underlies the growth and development of all living organisms.

The first occurs immediately following the ischemic insult and results in the rapid loss of neural cell viability; the second stage (which usually results in severe neural dysfunction) occurs over many hours following reperfusion. There is however, a window of opportunity shortly following the ischemia-reperfusion where damage to the brain can be minimized if appropriate therapeutic intervention was available. However, our ability to identify novel targets and devise strategies for the treatment of stroke relies on our understanding of (a) the molecular processes that are initiated following brain ischemia and (b) the delayed molecular events that follow reperfusion and hypoperfusion and result in extensive neuronal loss. A major component that accompanies stroke is the generation of oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to make a significant contribution to neuronal cell injury and death during both the early and late stages following ischemia. Therefore the molecular pathways that are involved in ROS generation are prime targets for the development of improved therapies. It has already been established by us that the antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase-1 (Gpx-1) is essential in protecting neurons from ischemic injury-death. A clearer understanding of how Gpx-1 confers this protection in vivo would make an important contribution towards the design of improved treatments. In this proposal, we plan to determine the role of Gpx-1 in an in vivo model of stroke to: (1) demonstrate in a broader sense the functional importance of this antioxidant enzyme in neuronal survival and (2) to demonstrate in a more specific manner, the impact of this enzyme on two signaling molecules, PI3kinase (PI3K) and NFkB (both of which are redox sensitive and play important roles in neuronal cell viability) and their relevance to ischemic cell injury and death."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Crack","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012520","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Crack","source_individual_id":"5024161","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Crack"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80087","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4228","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular mechanisms for the cell-type specific regulation of the tissue-type plasminogen activator gene","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["RNA binding proteins","fibrinolysis","gene regulation","mRNA stability","transcriptional regulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236862,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Fibrinolysis","Thrombosis","cardiovascular diseases"],"scientific_title":"Molecular mechanisms for the cell-type specific regulation of the tissue-type plasminogen activator gene","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Robert Medcalf","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236862","simplified_title":"To determine how a gene involved in the removal of blood clots is regulated in different cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"490500","source_system":"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is an important enzyme that is widely known for its ability to remove blood clots.

Information gained will not only add to the understanding of the broader field of gene regulation, but may also provide clues to manipulate the expression of the t-PA gene in different cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Magdaline Costa","data":{"first_name":"Magdaline","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041782","middle_name":"","last_name":"Costa","source_individual_id":"RMIS1025422","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Magdaline Costa"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87839","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Medcalf","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014929","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Medcalf","source_individual_id":"5016415","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Medcalf"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80745","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4226","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Biology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236860,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"","cia_name":"A/Pr Robert Medcalf","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236860","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"614750","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Medcalf","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014929","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Medcalf","source_individual_id":"5016415","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Medcalf"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80745","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4225","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Pathogenesis of clostridial myonecrosis","data":{"media_summary":"wound infection","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Clostridium perfringens","Clostridium septicum","bacterial genetics","bacterial pathogen","immunopathology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236859,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["acute infective illnesses","clostridial myonecrosis","gas gangrene","infectious disease","wound infection"],"scientific_title":"Pathogenesis of clostridial myonecrosis","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Julian Rood","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236859","simplified_title":"How do anaerobic bacteria cause gas gangrene?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"136750","source_system":"The aim of this project is to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of gas gangrene, an often fatal disease of particular significance to elderly and diabetic patients, who are particularly susceptible following injury, or surgery, or in some cases when suffering from colon cancer.

This project involves the study of the two bacteria that are the major causes of the disease. We aim to find out how the bacteria mediate the disease, in particular to determine which toxic factors produced by the bacteria are involved. The normal host response to a bacterial infection is a rapid influx of white blood cells to the infected tissue, which is part of the normal inflammatory response. These cells engulf and degrade the bacteria, clearing the infection. However, a major characteristic of gas gangrene pathology is that very few white blood cells infiltrate the infected tissue. We aim to determine why the host fails to mount an inflammatory response to this bacterial infection. We will achieve this objective by developing a better understanding of the role of the bacterial toxins in the development of this morbid disease. It is hoped the results from this study will enable the development of more effective therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for this disease and also provide a foundation for studies into the modulation of the host response by other bacterial species."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Dena Lyras","data":{"first_name":"Dena","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038197","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lyras","source_individual_id":"5016113","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Dena Lyras"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86900","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Boyd","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017852","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Boyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS8290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Boyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81554","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julian Rood","data":{"first_name":"Julian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004318","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Rood","source_individual_id":"RMIS46068","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julian Rood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77872","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4224","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Two-component regulatory systems involved in toxin production in Clostridium perfringens","data":{"media_summary":"wound infection","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Clostridium perfringens","bacterial genetics","bacterial pathogen","transcriptional regulation","two-component signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236858,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["acute infective illnesses","clostridial myonecrosis","gas gangrene","infectious disease","wound infection"],"scientific_title":"Two-component regulatory systems involved in toxin production in Clostridium perfringens","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Julian Rood","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236858","simplified_title":"How does the bacterium that causes gas gangrene control the production of its toxic proteins","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"78500","source_system":"The bacterium studied in this project causes gas gangrene, a severe and often fatal infection of traumatic or surgical wounds.

Research in this laboratory has identified two genes whose protein products are the key links in this regulatory network. The objectives of the project will be to determine which part of the regulatory protein interacts with the target toxin gene, to start to determine the structure of the regulatory protein so that the precise biochemical mechanism of action can be ascertained, to determine the components of the DNA target that are essential for binding activity, and to identify other genes that are involved in the regulation of both the toxin genes and other genes that may be implicated in the disease process. These studies will be facilitated by the availability of the complete genome sequence of this pathogenic bacterium. The project will make a major contribution to our knowledge of how bacteria that cause disease are able to control the production of the toxins that are critical to the disease process.

At present, there is a great interest in the possibility that high blood pressure in adults can result from stresses experienced by the fetus before birth. However, it is not known how prenatal compromise could lead to high blood pressure. We have recently established an animal model (using sheep) in which brief exposure to glucocorticoids - known as stress hormones - administered to the mother during early gestation results in high blood pressure in the offspring in adulthood. Increased levels of these hormones could occur in women at times when many may be unaware of their pregnancy (ie. smoking marijuana, chronic insomnia, accidents, loss of loved one, physical or mental stress or abuse). In addition, high doses of synthetic glucocorticoids might be given to pregnant patients for the treatment of asthma and acute migraine. The early origins of hypertension are of considerable importance to a large section of the community, namely the 25% who develop hypertension at the age 45 or over. If even a small proportion of hypertension can be prevented by reducing fetal exposure to excess glucocorticoids the impact on cardiovascular illness may be large. This research proposal has the potential to explain the basis for at least some of the 'essential' hypertension for which a mechanism has not been discovered after decades of research. This project will examine the separate roles of the kidney and brain, and in particular will determine whether permanent changes can be induced by exposure to stress hormones during early fetal life. Knowledge gained from this project could be used in devising strategies aimed at preventing or treating high blood pressure in adults."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Marelyn Wintour-Coghlan","data":{"first_name":"Marelyn","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0046345","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wintour-Coghlan","source_individual_id":"RMIS3009735","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Marelyn Wintour-Coghlan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89005","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Roger Evans","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018903","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Evans","source_individual_id":"5011298","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Roger Evans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81839","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Megan Cock","data":{"first_name":"Megan","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0018325","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cock","source_individual_id":"RMIS1022100","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Megan Cock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81692","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Miodrag Dodic","data":{"first_name":"Miodrag","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0001313","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dodic","source_individual_id":"RMIS2995299","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Miodrag Dodic"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77037","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4222","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Early detection of infants and young children with autism","data":{"media_summary":"early diagnosis","end_year":2005,"keywords":["autism","children","early detection","early diagnosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236834,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["autism spectrum disorders","developmental disorders","early childhood","early detection","early diagnosis"],"scientific_title":"Early detection of infants and young children with autism","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Bruce Tonge","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236834","simplified_title":"Identifying children with autism as early as possible","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"268250","source_system":"Autism is a severely handicapping condition adversely affecting social interaction, communication, behaviour, interests, and activities. Autism requires treatment at an early age (before 4 years). Despite finding that parents notice problems with their child's development within the first 2 years, on average diagnoses are made around 6 years of age. Treatment for autism should begin as early as possible to improve outcome. Diagnosis requires specialist assessment and these services are limited. Therefore it is not possible to undertake such assessments with all children who have developmental problems. This project therefore proposes to evaluate a method for screening large populations of children for autism, thus enabling timely and more appropriate referral to assessment services. Previous work by the investigators has developed a potential screening tool (DBC Early Screen) for autism in young children under 4 years with developmental delay that has high levels of accuracy in identifying those infants and children who are at risk of autism and require specialist assessment. This project proposes to undertake a community field trial to assess the accuracy and reliability of this early screen and to establish its suitability for wide use as a population screening tool. The preliminary testing of DBC Early Screen demonstrated that a community field trial was feasible. The results of this study will facilitate the referral of infants and young children to specialist autism assessment services, thus enabling the commencement of appropriate early intervention for children and their families from an early age."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stewart Einfeld","data":{"first_name":"Stewart","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018853","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Einfeld","source_individual_id":"RMIS153721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stewart Einfeld"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81825","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Kylie Gray","data":{"first_name":"Kylie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013320","middle_name":"Megan","last_name":"Gray","source_individual_id":"5014938","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Kylie Gray"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80302","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010691","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Tonge","source_individual_id":"RMIS35666","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79601","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4221","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An X-ray crystallographic investigation into the structural basis of T-cell allorecognition","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Crystallization","T-cell receptor interactions","X-ray crystallography","receptor complexes"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236825,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Allorecognition","Transplant rejection","immune system"],"scientific_title":"An X-ray crystallographic investigation into the structural basis of T-cell allorecognition","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Jamie Rossjohn","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236825","simplified_title":"Understnding how proteins cause transplant rejection","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"441000","source_system":"X-ray crystallography is an essential tool for solving the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of proteins.

Depending on the sequence of the amino acids, the protein molecule bends and forms a distinct, complex shape. This three dimensional shape allows it to specifically interact with carbohydrates, other proteins, such as enzymes or receptors, or even with molecules like DNA, to have its effect. To determine how a protein acts, it is vital to know the precise three-dimensional shape of a protein at the atomic level.

This process is triggered by insulin. One of the commonest diseases resulting from a failure of this cellular process is diabetes. A common form of diabetes which occurs in many adults in Australia results from insulin resistance, whereby the effects of insulin are diminished and cells become increasingly unable to uptake glucose. Recent studies have demonstrated that a novel enzyme known as SHIP-2 may play a role in regulating insulin action in cells. Deletion of SHIP-2 in mice results in these animals have increased sensitivity to insulin, low blood glucose levels, and a greatly enhanced ability to take up glucose in cells in response to low dose insulin. Our laboratory has been working on the cellular mechanisms regulating SHIP-2 function. We have recently revealed the intracellular location of SHIP-2 and also demonstrated how SHIP-2 is localized in the cell. These studies have shown that SHIP-2, via interactions with other proteins, regulates the actin cytoskeleton immediately beneath the cell membrane and this may be a mechanism for facilitating cellular glucose uptake. This research proposal aims to determine how SHIP-2 facilitates glucose uptake into cells. We will make cell lines and transgenic animals which express high levels of this enzyme and determine the functional consequences on insulin stimulated glucose uptake. Collectively these studies in the long term may facilitate better treatment strategies for diabetic patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4219","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neural control of renal function: Functionally specific populations of sympathetic nerves","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["glomerular capillary pressure","micropuncture","renal sympathetic nerve activity","renal vascular resistance"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236821,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["arterial hypoxia","congestive heart failure","hypertension","renal failure"],"scientific_title":"Neural control of renal function: Functionally specific populations of sympathetic nerves","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Kate Denton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236821","simplified_title":"How the nerves control kidney function","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"286250","source_system":"The kidneys are supplied with a dense network of nerves.

Recent outbreaks in Nicaragua and Brazil are timely reminders of the seriousness of disease caused by the Leptospira bacteria. In these outbreaks >10% of people developing the disease did not recover. Spread of the disease does not occur from person to person, but rather from animal to human. Leptospira are shed from infected animals via the urine; human infection may occur through contact with infected urine or urine contaminated materials. In Australia, leptospirosis is an occupational hazard with dairy farmers, pig handlers, banana pickers and abattoir workers being those most at risk. A recent and alarming development is the emergence of new risk groups associated with certain leisure activities. For example, in the USA three triathletes died from leptospirosis and it was subsequently determined that the source of infection was contaminated swimming water. This project will investigate aspects of the development of disease and immunity during infection by Leptospira. This will be achieved by analysing the set of proteins located on the surface of the bacterium. These proteins play a key role in the development of disease. Using state of the art technology, each of the proteins will be purified and identified.

Such diseases kill over a million people, mainly infants in developing countries, every year and lead to serious morbidity and mortality even in industrialised countries with well developed health care systems. In many cases the virulence of Shigella species is augmented by large fragments of DNA, called pathogenicity islands, that carry genes which contribute to the development of disease (pathogenesis) in humans. Pathogenicity islands are important genetic elements which appear to spread independantly throughout bacterial populations and therefore contribute to the emergence of new virulence traits in bacteria. Recently, we identified two related pathogenicity islands carried by both Shigella flexneri and other species of the genus Shigella. The two pathogenicity islands belong to a unique class of genetic elements found in Shigella species and virulent strains of the intestinal bacterium E. coli. Our current study is aimed at (1) understanding the mechanisms by which one of these islands, the she pathogenicity island, spreads from one bacterial strain to another to introduce disease-producing or virulence genes to new bacteria and (2) to study how the sigA virulence gene, carried on the she pathogenicity island, contributes to disease development in humans. We know that sigA encodes a protein toxin which contributes to the loss of fluid from the intestines of rabbits that have been experimentally infected with Shigella flexneri. We propose to study the structure and function of the SigA protein to determine how it interacts with tissues to produce a pathological state. Such studies will enhance our understanding of the process of disease development and contribute to the investigation and assessment of new strategies for therapeutic intervention."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Martin Scanlon","data":{"first_name":"Martin","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027806","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Scanlon","source_individual_id":"5017366","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Martin Scanlon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84175","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ben Adler","data":{"first_name":"Ben","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023267","middle_name":"","last_name":"Adler","source_individual_id":"5013128","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ben Adler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82991","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Harry Sakellaris","data":{"first_name":"Harry","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021905","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sakellaris","source_individual_id":"RMIS49992","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Harry Sakellaris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82639","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4215","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A TMS Study of Cortical Plasticity in Schizophrenia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["cortical plasticity","schizophrenia","transcranial magnetic stimulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":236807,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["mental health","psychosis","schizophrenia"],"scientific_title":"A TMS Study of Cortical Plasticity in Schizophrenia","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Fitzgerald","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236807","simplified_title":"Cortical Plasticity in Schizophrenia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"195500","source_system":"The cause of schizophrenia is uncertain. Several lines of evidence implicate abnormalities of functioning in circuits of nerve cells in the outer brain regions. Chemicals involved in these circuits are important for the capacity to learn and process new information and repeated exposure to stimuli. To date, it has been difficult to directly test the function of these circuits in patients with schizophrenia. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive means of stimulating nerve cells in superficial areas of the brain. During a TMS procedure, an electrical current passes through a coil placed close to the scalp. This current induces a magnetic field that stimulates electrical activity in nerves below the coil. TMS methods can be used to study the functioning of nerve cells in the brain and the way in which they respond to repeated stimuli. These methods will be used in this way to study the functioning of these circuits in patients with schizophrenia.

While progress has been made on prevention and early diagnosis, no curative treatment exists for stage IV melanoma. Tumour progression and the acquisition of metastatic competence primarily reflect dysregulation of cell adhesion and cell motility rather than proliferation and survival. In this context, Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) and their membrane-bound ephrin ligands are crucial mediators of cell adhesion and motility and are notably overexpressed in metastatic tumours rather than primary (benign) lesions5. Our laboratories were the first to identify EphA3 7, and one of the first to isolate its ligand, ephrin-A5. EphA3 was isolated from acute lymphoblastoid leukemia and malignant melanoma patients, where increasing expression levels correlate with metastatic progression. Soluble, non-clustered forms of Ephs and ephrins are effective inhibitors of Eph activity 3 and provide opportunities to generate specific drugs for cancer therapy. We now propose a research and development program for the development of EphA3-specific drugs and their production for pre-clinical and clinical evaluation for placement onto a national and international market."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Scott","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039591","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Scott","source_individual_id":"RMIS66624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Scott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87269","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Herbert Treutlein","data":{"first_name":"Herbert","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0028459","middle_name":"","last_name":"Treutlein","source_individual_id":"RMIS81047","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Herbert Treutlein"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Boyd","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023731","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Boyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS3609","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Boyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83095","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann","data":{"first_name":"Martin","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020227","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lackmann","source_individual_id":"RMIS7979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82165","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4188","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development and evaluation of biological reagents targeting and inhibiting function of the EphA3 receptor on tumor cells","data":{"media_summary":"tumour angiogenesis","end_year":2005,"keywords":["antibody therapy","metastasis and invasion","rational drug design","receptor tyrosine kinase antagonists","tumour targeting"],"nhmrc_grant_id":234707,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cancer: mechanism of growth, invasion, metastasis","drug design","leukemia","metastatic progression","tumour angiogenesis"],"scientific_title":"Development and evaluation of biological reagents targeting and inhibiting function of the EphA3 receptor on tumor cells","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/234707","simplified_title":"Inhibiting metastatic tumours by targeting Eph receptors","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"490500","source_system":"Eph receptors and their ligands regulate morphogenesis in the embryo; they direct migration and positioning of cells during the formation of tissue layers and organ systems. There is little evidence for a function of Ephs in adult tissues. However, their abundant, un-scheduled occurrence in various malignant tumours, indicates a role in cancer. Human EphA3, the principle subject of this proposal, is not found in adult tissue but is present at high levels in lung, kidney and brain tumours, leukemia and malignant melanoma. High levels of EphA3 and corresponding ligands correlate with melanoma progression, and EphA3 stimulation triggers repulsion and detachment of melanoma cells. It is likely that Eph A3 is involved in release and spreading of tumour cells during melanoma progression. We have characterised reagents, the soluble EphA3 ligand and a monoclonal anti-EphA3 antibody, which bind EphA3 with high affinity and specificity. We will use these two proteins, or modified forms containing attached radiochemicals or cytotoxins, to target human tumours that were implanted into into immuno-deficient mice as animal model system. Our studies will determine if the specificity of our reagents, suggested from previous in-vitro studies, will allow imaging of EphA3 containing tumours, and effect their targeted killing. We will also use a tissue culture model, containing artificial epidermal and dermal layers of skin cells, to study if an inhibitory form of the EphA3 ligand will affect the invasiveness of EphA3 positive, metastatic melanoma cells. Furthermore, we will identify essential parts of this ligand to develop inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties. Together, our studies will establish the role for EphA3 in cancer progression and to assess the efficacy of EphA3 targeting for tumor killing and prevention of metastasis. We envision that this will provide the groundwork for Eph-specific reagents with anti-metastatic action in cancer therapy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Scott","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039591","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Scott","source_individual_id":"RMIS66624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Scott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87269","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Fook Lee","data":{"first_name":"Fook","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037966","middle_name":"Thean","last_name":"Lee","source_individual_id":"RMIS1696105","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Fook Lee"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86835","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann","data":{"first_name":"Martin","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020227","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lackmann","source_individual_id":"RMIS7979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Martin Lackmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82165","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4183","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Roles of NADPH oxidase and caveolae in oxidative stress in vascular disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["NADPH oxidase","artery","atherosclerosis","caveolae","reactive oxygen species"],"nhmrc_grant_id":232324,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Roles of NADPH oxidase and caveolae in oxidative stress in vascular disease","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Stavros Selemidis","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/232324","simplified_title":"Roles of NADPH oxidase and caveolae in oxidative stress in vascular disease","sub_type":"Peter Doherty Biomedical ECF","total_budget":"289000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Stavros Selemidis","data":{"first_name":"Stavros","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027868","middle_name":"","last_name":"Selemidis","source_individual_id":"RMIS1951621","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Stavros Selemidis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84191","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4165","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Vaccines"],"nhmrc_grant_id":223304,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Parasitology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Magdalena Plebanski","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/223304","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"577000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Magdalena Plebanski","data":{"first_name":"Magdalena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027374","middle_name":"","last_name":"Plebanski","source_individual_id":"5011488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Magdalena Plebanski"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84070","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4039","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Synaptic Plasticity in the Central Nervous System","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Biophysics and Medical Physics","Neurology -

It is a significant health problem both here in Australia and overseas with around 180,000 patients diagnosed each year in the Western world. Cirrhosis arises from many causes, two major groups being patients who contract hepatitis and alcoholics. People with cirrhosis have a much increased risk of liver failure, which requires liver transplantation, or of developing liver cancer, for which current treatments have limited success. We have been studying two proteins, activin and follistatin, both of which are made in the liver. We are interested in activin because it is one of the body's mechanisms to control cell growth, and also seems to stimulate the development of scar tissue. Follistatin is the natural inhibitory substance for activin. It blocks the effects of activin and helps promote cell growth in the liver. We believe that follistatin may also be useful in controlling liver scarring. This process will be studied in animal models of cirrhosis, in the hope that follistatin treatment will reduce the level of liver damage. If successful, this would be important information that would enable us to design treatments applicable to human sufferers of these liver diseases. In another part of the project, we will assess whether activin and follistatin might be useful markers of liver disease. Most patients require a liver biopsy to assess the amount of liver damage, and a simple blood test would be a far easier, less traumatic and cheaper alternative."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David De Kretser","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024447","middle_name":"Morritz","last_name":"De Kretser","source_individual_id":"RMIS3657635","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David De Kretser"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83276","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof William Sievert","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016219","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sievert","source_individual_id":"5019263","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof William Sievert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81091","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"David  Phillips","data":{"first_name":"David ","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0003959","middle_name":"","last_name":"Phillips","source_individual_id":"RMIS6270","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David  Phillips"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77772","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3960","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant 2002","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["None"],"nhmrc_grant_id":219351,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant 2002","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"","cia_name":"Ms Rosalba Drummond","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219351","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant 2002","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"764187","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Rosalba Drummond","data":{"first_name":"Rosalba","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0018774","middle_name":"","last_name":"Drummond","source_individual_id":"RMIS704027","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Rosalba Drummond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81809","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3868","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Haemopoiesis and embryonic development","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["blood diseases, embryonic development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":219329,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Haemopoiesis and embryonic development","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Comparative studies will provide a more complete picture of human B-cell ontogeny. Culture systems developed for ES cells-embryoid bodies (EB) - EB-derived cells, fetal pancreas and adult pancreas duct cells, will be employed to screen for and identify novel growth-differentiation factors and to optimise parameters for creating B cells in vitro or (re) generating B cells in vivo. Genetic constructs allowing regulated expression of fluorescently-tagged marker genes and growth-transcription factors will be introduced into cultured cells or transgenic mice to enable progenitor B cells to be tracked and isolated. Progenitor B cells will be typed with panels of known novel markers molecules at the gene and protein level, and gene expression profiles of tissue yielding B cells will be analysed across time to reveal further candidate markers. Molecules and methods effective in mouse systems will be applied to human ES cell-derived or pancreatic duct cells. The capacity to progenitor cells or insulin-secreting cells to ameliorate diabetes when transplanted into the testis, under the kidney capsule or into the pancreas of mouse models would represent proof-of-concept. Functional B cells derived from human ERS cells or pancreas duct cells, or growth factors that regenerate B cells in vivo, could together with appropriate immunotherapy restore B-cell function in

population. HCV is a quasispecies characterised by sequence variations and the rise of immune escape mutants. No vaccine is available, hence there is an urgent need for prevention of infection and for effective treatment. No animal model exists with the exception of non-human primates. An authentic cell culture system is not available. The understanding of the immune response against this virus is important for the development of potential vaccines. A potential vaccine must be able to induce a broad immune response to overcome the HCV quasispecies. Because of the relevant health issues, we will generate virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from an envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg-S) in which a variety of HCV-specific protein sequences are inserted. HBsAg-S wildtype particles can induce a strong immune response and are currently used as a vaccine against hepatitis B virus. These VLPs will be modified and a variety of HCV-specific epitopes inserted. The recombinant VLPs will be used to induce humoral (B-cell) anti-HCV immune responses in mice.

This study will build on our existing work where we have developed a cohort study of adults with early knee OA. These people were initially recruited in 1997-8. An extensive data base of potential risk factors for OA has been collected and both X-rays of the knee and MRI have been performed at baseline and 2 years. Extending the follow up from 2 to 5 years will allow not only more precise estimation of rates of cartilage loss and assessment of risk factors, but also enable assessment of the assumption of linearity of cartilage volume loss. It will also be possible to partition the observed variability in rates of loss into true between-subject variability and within subject residual variability. This partitioning will provide valuable information for the design of future studies in OA, similar to the establishment of statistical design principles for patterns of loss in bone mineral density."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graeme Jones","data":{"first_name":"Graeme","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025821","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jones","source_individual_id":"5012186","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Graeme Jones"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83653","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Forbes","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024874","middle_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Forbes","source_individual_id":"5012745","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Forbes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83393","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Flavia Cicuttini","data":{"first_name":"Flavia","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018263","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Cicuttini","source_individual_id":"RMIS3994","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Flavia Cicuttini"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81679","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3176","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Control of Alveolar Epithelial Cell Differentiation Before and After Birth","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["alveolar epithelial cells","cellular differentiation","corticosteroids","fetus","lung development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194436,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["lung immaturity","respiratory insufficiency in the newborn","surfactant insufficency"],"scientific_title":"Control of Alveolar Epithelial Cell Differentiation Before and After Birth","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Stuart Hooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194436","simplified_title":"How do the alveolar epithelial cells within the lung become specialised?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"376980","source_system":"In the lung, gas exchange takes place in small terminal airsacs called alveoli.

Failure of the uterus to contract forcefully, ineffective labour, is a major cause of caesarean delivery. Drip infusion of oxytocin is routinely used in attempts to strengthen the weak contractions of ineffective labour, but this is not always successful in bringing about vaginal delivery. The normal preparation of the uterus for the process of birth is likely to involve a complex array of processes. The failure to successfully resolve ineffective labour, other than by caesarean section, stems from a lack of understanding of these processes. In our studies of the human uterus over the past few years we found that the behaviour of samples obtained from women undergoing caesarean section during labour was quite variable. Some samples possessed a high degree of negative electricity which made contraction difficult. Some other samples were quite resistant to the contracting effects of oxytocin. In yet a third group, the uterus did not contract when given prostaglandin, one of the body's most important hormones during labour. When the obstetricians checked the medical records of these women, they found that ineffective labour had been diagnosed. The aim of this study is to work out the details of what is happening in these cases of ineffective labour. Since this problem is a major cause of caesarean delivery, a greater understanding of the underlying causes will facilitate the development of more effective treatments and hence bring about a resolution which is fundamental to healthy mothers and babies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helena Parkington","data":{"first_name":"Helena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044715","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Parkington","source_individual_id":"5016864","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Helena Parkington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88566","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Eric Moses","data":{"first_name":"Eric","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038644","middle_name":"Keith","last_name":"Moses","source_individual_id":"5016574","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Eric Moses"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87012","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shaun Brennecke","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023770","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Brennecke","source_individual_id":"RMIS3360","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Shaun Brennecke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83105","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3174","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of eicosanoid production in the fetal placenta in preterm labour","data":{"media_summary":"prevention of prematurity","end_year":2004,"keywords":["fetal physiology","parturition","placenta","premature labour","prostaglandins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194423,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["fetal medicine","fetal well-being","neonatal survival","parturition","prevention of prematurity"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of eicosanoid production in the fetal placenta in preterm labour","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Ian Young","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194423","simplified_title":"prostaglandins and parturition","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"256980","source_system":"Prostaglandins are fatty substances made within the body and they are what causes the pregnant uterus to contract and push out the fetus. At present we can't control preterm birth because we don't understand well enough how prostaglandin synthesis is controlled.

If we find this is so, there may be far-reaching implications for the ways in which anti-inflammatory drugs are used, not only in prevention of premature birth, but in inflammatory diseases too. Most research in this area has been directed toward understanding what controls the overall synthesis of prostaglandins, but there are several types of prostaglandins with different functions. we are now in a position to study, for the first time, how the synthesis of the specific prostaglandins is regulated in the pregnant uterus and how this changes during normal and preterm birth."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ian Young","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0029002","middle_name":"","last_name":"Young","source_individual_id":"RMIS130428","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ian Young"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84520","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Jonathan Hirst","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0019636","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hirst","source_individual_id":"RMIS59251","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jonathan Hirst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82003","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Greg Rice","data":{"first_name":"Greg","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009889","middle_name":"Edward","last_name":"Rice","source_individual_id":"RMIS2438912","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Greg Rice"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79384","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3173","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular mouse models of epilepsy.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Cre/lox knockout mice","EEG","electrophysiology","knockout mice","murine models of epilepsy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194422,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["epilepsy","neurogenetics","neurological disorders"],"scientific_title":"Molecular mouse models of epilepsy.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr JOHN DRAGO","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194422","simplified_title":"Genetic epilepsy in mice.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"123270","source_system":"Epilepsy is an important human disease because it causes physical trauma and sudden death in addition to immense social and economic hardship. The genetic basis of a number of epilepsy syndromes has been identified but the precise mechanism whereby mutations produce seizures is unknown. Several mutations in the alpha4 neuronal nicotinic receptor (a4 nAChR) gene have been identified in Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (ADNFLE). This is a rare form of inherited epilepsy characterized by the presence of seizures during light sleep. In vitro studies using the human mutated DNA (i.e. DNA containing the genetic defect) have suggested that this mutation results in reduced activity of the receptor. Therefore a mouse in which this gene is destroyed would be relevant in understanding the human disease. We have generated an a4 nAChR knockout (KO) mouse and plan to use the mouse to test the idea that loss of function of the a4 nAChR in vivo is associated with enhanced seizure activity. The KO mice do not have unprovoked seizures but appear to have an increased number of major motor seizures in response to pentylenetetrazole, an agent which is known to cause seizures by blocking the effects of the brain inhibitory molecule GABA. Interestingly, a4 nAChRs are known to control the release of GABA. We therefore propose that our knockout mice have seizures because they tend to under produce GABA. We will also make and analyse a mouse line with the same genetic mutation as patients with ADNFLE. The experiments are aimed at understanding the way that seizures are generated and spread in the brain in these rare forms of epilepsy. The hope is that understanding these mechanisms will help us better understand and therefore treat common forms of epilepsy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Harold Coleman","data":{"first_name":"Harold","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024194","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Coleman","source_individual_id":"RMIS55381","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Harold Coleman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83213","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Malcolm Horne","data":{"first_name":"Malcolm","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007968","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Horne","source_individual_id":"5015311","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Malcolm Horne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78856","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Drago","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0001356","middle_name":"","last_name":"Drago","source_individual_id":"RMIS8309","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr John Drago"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77052","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3172","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Efficacy of physiotherapy after hydrodilatation for the painful stiff shoulder: a randomised placebo-controlled trial","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["evidence based clinical practice","physiotherapy","randomised controlled trial","shoulder disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194417,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["musculoskeletal disorders","physiotherapy","randomised controlled trial","shoulder disorders"],"scientific_title":"Efficacy of physiotherapy after hydrodilatation for the painful stiff shoulder: a randomised placebo-controlled trial","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rehabilitation and Therapy: Occupational and Physical","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Rachelle Buchbinder","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194417","simplified_title":"A clinical trial of physiotherapy treatment after hydrodilatation for the painful stiff shoulder","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"269020","source_system":"Shoulder disorders are common, being third only to back and neck complaints as musculoskeletal reasons for medical consultation and they account for 10% of all physiotherapy referrals. The stiff painful shoulder affects up to 2-5% of the general population, being more common in middle age and diabetes. It causes significant pain and disability that restricts activities of daily living as well as work and leisure. Forty percent of sufferers will continue to have symptoms and restricted movements beyond 3 years and 15% will have persistent disability. Because this disease is prevalent, it imposes a considerable burden on the Australian health care system. Shoulder hydrodilatation is a common conservative treatment option that has been shown by our research group to have short-term but not long-term benefits. Physiotherapy may be prescribed following hydrodilatation on the basis that it may maintain the initial benefits seen with hydrodilatation. However, there are no studies to either support or refute this hypothesis. Thus, this novel research project will answer important questions about the efficacy of a physiotherapy program in addition to hydrodilatation for the stiff painful shoulder. We will determine whether physiotherapy offers a benefit over hydrodilatation alone and if so, whether this benefit is sustained. In addition we will determine whether the additional costs of physiotherapy represent good value for money. The results of this project can then be easily and immediately translated into clinical practice as recommendations can be made about the usefulness of physiotherapy for this patient population. The results will be of major benefit not just to the physiotherapy profession but to the medical profession who must justify patient referral to physiotherapy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Anthony Harris","data":{"first_name":"Anthony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037124","middle_name":"Howard","last_name":"Harris","source_individual_id":"5011907","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Anthony Harris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86610","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Forbes","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024874","middle_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"Forbes","source_individual_id":"5012745","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Forbes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83393","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sally Green","data":{"first_name":"Sally","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013337","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Green","source_individual_id":"RMIS379483","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sally Green"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80306","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rachelle Buchbinder","data":{"first_name":"Rachelle","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006298","middle_name":"","last_name":"Buchbinder","source_individual_id":"5013671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rachelle Buchbinder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78418","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kim Bennell","data":{"first_name":"Kim","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000329","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Bennell","source_individual_id":"RMIS97963","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kim Bennell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76743","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3170","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of regeneration of Dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["axon regeneration","basal ganglia","dopamine","neural plasticity","neurogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194411,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Movement disorders","Parkinson's disease","nervous system disorders","neurological disease"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of regeneration of Dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Malcolm Horne","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194411","simplified_title":"Regulation of sprouting in Parkinson's disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"115880","source_system":"Parkinson's Disease (PD) results from the progressive loss of brain cells in the part of the brain called substantia nigra. These brain cells contain a chemical called Dopamine (DA). The symptoms of Parkinson's disease arise when about 80% these DA neurones are lost suggesting that some form of compensation must occur up to this point. In previous studies we have demonstrated that one mechanism for this compensation is through sprouting or branching of the remaining neurones. We have preliminary evidence about the way this is sprouting and regeneration is controlled. The aim of this grant is to explore in detail the mechanisms whereby sprouting is induced and regulated. The significance of this study is that it may provide insights into the way in which regulation of regeneration of the nervous system is controlled.

Inherited cancer syndromes have been described that have lost the ability to switch off PI 3-kinase signals. The current project aims to investigate a recently identified enzyme called the 4-phosphatase that has the ability to terminate PI 3-kinase signals. Recent studies have shown this enzyme regulates cell growth. In addition key experiments have shown the enzyme is important as it may regulate certain strains of bacterial infection.

and in most cases, is caused by a clot in the artery that supplies the oxygenated blood and nutrients such as glucose to that region. Within minutes, the region of the brain that is deprived of blood flow will die and so the functions controlled by that region are lost. In the majority of stroke patients, the middle cerebral artery is blocked and this affects parts of the brain controlling movement of limbs or speech and so these patients suffer permanent disabilities. Not surprisingly, stroke is the most common life-threatening neurological disease and the major cause of disbility in adults over 45 years of age. Apart from the profound effect that stroke has on the patient and family, the annual cost of disability to the Australian community is approximately $ 1 billion. If the disability could be reduced, this could reduce the need for institutionalisation of patients and then the cost saving would be great. So our research is directed towards designing drugs to minimise the disability after stroke. Research in the past has focussed on designing drugs to minimise damage to the grey matter in brain but it is becoming apparent that the white matter in brain is very important for transmitting information and also needs to be protected. We will study the biochemical changes in white matter after a stroke in a rat model and use this information to design in a rational way, novel drugs to minimise damage to white matter (axons), thereby reducing the degree of disability after a stroke."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bevyn Jarrott","data":{"first_name":"Bevyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043281","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jarrott","source_individual_id":"RMIS188964","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bevyn Jarrott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88213","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jennifer Callaway","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018069","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Callaway","source_individual_id":"5013763","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Jennifer Callaway"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81617","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3153","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Bioinformatics","Phosphatase","Protease","Protein structure","Serpins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194331,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr James Whisstock","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194331","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"504500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Whisstock","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040415","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Whisstock","source_individual_id":"5018263","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof James Whisstock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87471","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3152","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A bioinformatic analysis and structural study on the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Bioinformatics","Crystallography","Phosphatase","Signaling pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194330,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Essential thrombocytosis","Thrombocytopenia"],"scientific_title":"A bioinformatic analysis and structural study on the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr James Whisstock","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194330","simplified_title":"Structural and functional studies on enzymes that control intracellular signaling.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"421320","source_system":"Communication (or signaling) inside the cell enables the cell to respond to factors in its external environment, such as hormones or growth factors. The inositol phosphates and the phosphoinositides are signaling molecules that play an essential role in intracellular communication. The 5-phosphatases are able to modify these molecules and terminate, and in certain cases stimulate, signals. Failure to properly control intracellular signaling pathways may result in abnormal cell growth and cancer. Human 5-phosphatases are a complex family of enzymes: In addition to the region responsible for phosphatase activity (the catalytic domain) many members contain other protein modules . These associated domains may perform critical roles, such as regulating intracellular location and docking with other proteins. This project aims to perform a computational investigation of human 5-phosphatases and their associated domains. In particular we will search for novel phosphatases, investigate the evolutionary relationships between members of each domain family, and make testable predictions regarding the function of uncharacterized domains. This study will take advantage of data produced by the recently completed human genome project. The second aim of the project is to determine, using X-ray crystallography, the three-dimensional shape (or atomic structure) of a representative member of the 5-phosphatase family. Solving the structure of a 5-phosphatase at the atomic level is critical for understanding the nature of substrate specificity and for rational drug design."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Whisstock","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040415","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Whisstock","source_individual_id":"5018263","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof James Whisstock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87471","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jamie Rossjohn","data":{"first_name":"Jamie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004343","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rossjohn","source_individual_id":"RMIS228933","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jamie Rossjohn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77879","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3151","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"MITOCHONDRIA, OXIDATIVE STRESS AND NEURONAL APOPTOSIS: BIOCHEMICAL, CELLULAR AND PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES","data":{"media_summary":"oxidative stress and apoptosis","end_year":2002,"keywords":["apoptosis","biochemical pharmacology","mitochondria","neuronal death","oxidative stress"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194323,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["biochemistry and molecular biology","neurodegenerative disease","neuronal cell death","neuropharmacology","oxidative stress and apoptosis"],"scientific_title":"MITOCHONDRIA, OXIDATIVE STRESS AND NEURONAL APOPTOSIS: BIOCHEMICAL, CELLULAR AND PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Phillip Nagley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194323","simplified_title":"BIOCHEMISTRY OF NERVE CELL DEATH","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"145880","source_system":"Our goal is to understand the detailed process whereby nerve cells die after various stresses and injury. We aim also to develop novel ways of protecting cells against such death. The death of nerve cells plays an important role in a series of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Motor Neurone Diseases. One prevalent cause of cell death arises from the action of transmitters that normally signal between nerve cells but which, under conditions of stress and injury, cause overstimulation of the nerve cells leading to death (excitotoxicity). Mitochondria are component of cells normally providing energy for the cell to carry out its various functions; but under stress conditions mitochondria act as controllers in cellular decision-making processes leading to cell death. Moreover, mitochondria are known to play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, as they are a source of damaging oxygen derivatives called free radicals that cause cell injury. Mitochondria are also involved in death resulting from excitotoxicity. In order to understand the detailed mechanism of the nerve cell death process, we will use cultured nerve cells from the brains of laboratory mice, including both normal mice and those that are models of neurodegenerative disease. Injury leading to death will be induced by analogues of the transmitters that cause excitotoxicity. We will concentrate the those aspects of the death process that involve mitochondria, as this will enable us to test a range of antioxidants that can be expected to lead to new drug treatments for neuronal cell injury. Included in these compounds are novel antioxidants that are targeted to mitochondria. This project brings together the expertise in neuroscience and pharmacology of Professor Beart with the skills in biochemistry of Professor Nagley, particularly in mitochondrial and cell death research, to address this important medical research problem in a multidisciplinary manner."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Phillip Nagley","data":{"first_name":"Phillip","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044471","middle_name":"","last_name":"Nagley","source_individual_id":"5016624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"E/Pr Phillip Nagley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88525","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Nam Cheung","data":{"first_name":"Nam","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024085","middle_name":"Sang","last_name":"Cheung","source_individual_id":"5013899","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Nam Cheung"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83176","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Beart","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011704","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"Beart","source_individual_id":"RMIS131692","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Philip Beart"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79873","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3150","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Metabotropic glutamate receptors: pharmacological studies of receptor subtypes in neuronal injury.","data":{"media_summary":"neuroprotective drugs to minimise death after stroke","end_year":2002,"keywords":["G proteins","excitatory amino acids","excitotoxicity","glial-neuron relationship","glutamate receptors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194320,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["apoptosis of neurons","neuro-excitatory side-effects","neurodegenerative and age-related diseases","neuropharmacology","neuroprotective drugs to minimise death after stroke"],"scientific_title":"Metabotropic glutamate receptors: pharmacological studies of receptor subtypes in neuronal injury.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Philip Beart","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194320","simplified_title":"Pharmacology of metabotropic glutamate receptors in neurodegeneration.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"145770","source_system":"Glutamate is the major transmitter of excitatory information in the mammalian brain.

The expression of many bacterial genes is controlled by a sophisticated battery of regulatory systems that respond to individual, very specific, environmental signals. Such regulatory systems are capable of exerting very precise control over the level of gene expression, in response to the concentration of specific molecules in the immediate environment. However, there is evidence to suggest that many important disease-causing bacteria are much less reliant on specific regulatory systems. Instead, these bacteria rely more heavily what have been termed global systems for the regulation of gene expression. Such systems typically respond to less specific signals, such as the growth rate of the bacterial cell, but nevertheless appear capable of very precise control. We have evidence for a previously uncharacterised type of global control system that appears to be widespread amongst bacteria. It is likely that many virulence genes in a variety of disease-causing bacteria will prove to be controlled by similar means. Therefore this project will not only provide an insight into how expression of these particular virulence determinants is regulated, but will yield data that may help in our understanding of precise global regulatory processes in other bacterial species of medical importance."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Davies","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018567","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Davies","source_individual_id":"RMIS63182","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Davies"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81757","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3147","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Signalling of muscle force by Golgi tendon organs during exercise and fatigue","data":{"media_summary":"Sensory function","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Eccentric exercise","Golgi tendon organs","Motor control","Proprioception and kinaesthesia","Somatosensory system"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194307,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Basic science","Biological sciences","Motor control","Proprioception - abnormality","Sensory function"],"scientific_title":"Signalling of muscle force by Golgi tendon organs during exercise and fatigue","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr John Gregory","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194307","simplified_title":"How does exercise alter the perception of muscle force?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"181320","source_system":"It is a common experience for objects being carried to feel heavier and tasks needing muscular effort to become more difficult as one becomes tired and the muscles fatigue during exertion. The sensation of muscle force depends on two factors. One, a sense of the effort required to perform a task, is generated in the central nervous system and. The other, a sense of the force actually developed by the muscles, is generated in the muscles themselves by signals from sensory receptors called Golgi tendon organs. The sensation of muscle force and the heaviness of objects results from a combination of both senses, but the contribution of each is unknown. The aim of the project is to determine whether the disturbance of force sense in fatigued muscles results from changes in the way tendon organs signal the actual force developed by the muscles. This will be important for understanding how force sense is disturbed following exercise and in disease states, and for understanding the normal way muscle force is sensed in everyday situations. Disturbances of force sense after exercise will be documented in human subjects by asking them to generate what they perceive to be equal forces in both arms or legs, before and after one limb only is exercised. Errors in force estimation will show up as mismatches between the two limbs. The difficulty with human experiments is that the signals generated by tendon organs cannot be measured directly, but only inferred, perhaps wrongly. This difficulty will be overcome by measuring tendon organ activity directly in anaesthetised animals, where the muscles will be electrically stimulated to perform exercise similar to that in the human experiments. A change in tendon organ signalling will be taken to mean that similar changes in humans could be responsible for disturbances of force sense. In further experiments, the mechanism of the changes will be explored."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Uwe Proske","data":{"first_name":"Uwe","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044931","middle_name":"","last_name":"Proske","source_individual_id":"RMIS3984","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Uwe Proske"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88632","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Morgan","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026848","middle_name":"Lloyd","last_name":"Morgan","source_individual_id":"RMIS5221","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Morgan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83953","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"John Gregory","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0001911","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gregory","source_individual_id":"RMIS206768","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"John Gregory"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77189","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3146","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Couch grass allergy: cellular and molecular studies directed at improved specific immunotherapy","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["T lymphocytes","epitope mapping","respiratory allergy","specific allergen immunotherapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194304,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["T cell immunotherapy","asthma and allergic disease prevention","asthma, allergic rhinitis"],"scientific_title":"Couch grass allergy: cellular and molecular studies directed at improved specific immunotherapy","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Allergy","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Robyn O'Hehir","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194304","simplified_title":"Human immune responses to couch grass allergens","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"406980","source_system":"Couch grass pollen is increasingly important in Australia and other temperate and subtropical regions as a seasonal allergen causing asthma and hay fever. In our allergy clinic 85% of patients with seasonal asthma and-or hay fever are allergic to both couch grass pollen and rye grass pollen. Standard allergy treatment shots usually cover the rye grass pollen allergens but there is no cross-reactivity with couch grass pollen and therefore symptoms due to couch grass pollen are not controlled. These shots are seldom used in asthmatic patients because of the risk of severe asthma or generalised allergic reactions. We plan to examine human blood cell responses to couch grass pollen allergens before and after allergy shots with a preparation that includes couch grass pollen and rye grass pollen. A comparable control group of patients receiving only drug therapy will also be investigated. This study will identify dominant sites of couch grass pollen allergen immunoreactivity and reveal mechanisms of desensitisation. Based on this information, we will develop novel couch grass pollen proteins that retain the positive features needed for a successful desensitising vaccine but without the ability to bind to allergy antibodies and possibly cause severe adverse events such as asthma attacks.

Because ES cells represent an unlimited source of any type of human cell, they have great potential for use in research areas such as functional genomics and drug discovery, and in regenerative medicine, the use of transplanted tissue to cure degenerative disease. Our laboratory is one of two in the world to develop human ES cells and the first to demonstrate differentiation of these cells into specialised cells-neurons- in vitro. In order to use ES cells, we need to learn more about how to grow and manipulate them in the laboratory, and how to turn them into desired types of somatic cell. Our study is based on the hypothesis that growth control in human ES cells resembles growth control in the embryo, with interactions between stem cells and their differentiated offspring mediated by signals from membrane bound or soluble proteins directing the differentiation of the stem cells. We have recently identified several key protein regulators of human ES cells. This project will use high throughput analysis of gene expression to pinpoint more candidate regulatory proteins. Then we will use cell culture systems and techniques developed in our laboratory to determine how these proteins may act to control stem cell growth. These studies will result in a greatly improved ability to control stem cells and turn them into specialised cell types for use in research and regenerative medicine. These advances are essential if ES cells are to progress from their current status as an interesting laboratory phenomenon to become a powerful tool for research and medicine."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Martin Pera","data":{"first_name":"Martin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021420","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Pera","source_individual_id":"5042954","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Martin Pera"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82502","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3144","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Alveolar epithelial cell differentiation","Corticosteroids & lung development","Fetal lung growth & development","Ventilation & Resus. of prematurely born infants"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194291,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Stuart Hooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194291","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"558000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stuart Hooper","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007960","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Hooper","source_individual_id":"5015309","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stuart Hooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78853","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3143","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Activin and inhibin","Growth factor regulation","Hepatic fibrosis","Inflammatory mediators","Vascular biology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194274,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr David Phillips","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194274","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"781750","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"David  Phillips","data":{"first_name":"David ","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0003959","middle_name":"","last_name":"Phillips","source_individual_id":"RMIS6270","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David  Phillips"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77772","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3142","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Adaptation of muscle to eccentric exercise and its clinical applications 194272","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Biomechanics","Eccentric Exercise","Muscle Mechanics","Skeletal muscle hypertrophy","Sports injury"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194272,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Hamstring injuries","Idiopathic toe walking","Muscle tear injury"],"scientific_title":"Adaptation of muscle to eccentric exercise and its clinical applications 194272","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biomechanics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"HUMAN MOVEMENT AND SPORTS SCIENCE","cia_name":"Prof David Morgan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194272","simplified_title":"Adaptation of muscle to eccentric exercise and its clinical applications","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196410","source_system":"Work in this laboratory has concentrated on Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), the soreness felt for several days after unaccustomed exercise. This is particularly so when the exercise involves stretching of active muscle, called eccentric exercise, at longer muscle lengths. DOMS is due to microscopic muscle damage. A rapid training effect, leading to reduced soreness from a subsequent bout of similar exercise, has been identified by us as due to a specific structural adaptation. This results in the optimum length for tension generation moving to longer muscle length so that the muscle is less likely to be damaged during subsequent stretches. Hypothesizing that gross muscle tears arise from the microscopic damage, we have begun investigating whether eccentric exercise training can prevent hamstring muscle injuries. We have shown that eccentric exercise shifts the optimum length for contraction in human hamstring muscles. We are now examining athletes with past injuries, known to be likely to re-injure. Other experiments are designed to show that sports that cause injury do indeed include eccentric exercise of the hamstring muscles. We are also investigating the effectiveness of eccentric exercise in treating apparently normal children who compulsively walk on their toes. We have built monitoring equipment and are monitoring both conventional and exercise based treatments designed to shift muscle optimum length to longer lengths to allow the children to place their heels on the ground. Finally, most muscles contain different fibre types, distinguished mainly by their speed of contraction. It has been suggested that they are not all uniformly susceptible to damage from eccentric exercise, a result not predicted by our theory. However, we hypothesize that secondary factors, particularly the length for generating optimum tension, may be responsible for these differences. We plan to test this idea by measuring properties of different types of motor units."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Uwe Proske","data":{"first_name":"Uwe","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044931","middle_name":"","last_name":"Proske","source_individual_id":"RMIS3984","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Uwe Proske"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88632","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Morgan","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026848","middle_name":"Lloyd","last_name":"Morgan","source_individual_id":"RMIS5221","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Morgan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83953","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Paul Percival","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009612","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Percival","source_individual_id":"RMIS2990973","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Paul Percival"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79309","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3141","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of the calcineurin negative regulator, DSCR1, in heart development and hypertrophy.","data":{"media_summary":"molecular basis of disease","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Down syndrome","cardiac hypertrophy","cell growth","molecular biology","transgenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194255,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Down syndrome","cardiac abnormalities","cell growth","chromosomal disorders","molecular basis of disease"],"scientific_title":"The role of the calcineurin negative regulator, DSCR1, in heart development and hypertrophy.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Failure of heart valve development and holes in the heart, are very common abnormalities occurring in nearly 1 % of all live births. This type of anomaly is also observed in about 44 % of individuals with Down syndrome, which results when individuals carry an extra copy of chromosome 21. Thus, it is likely that a gene located on human chromosome 21 contributes to this pathology and indeed our work on the identification of genes with the potential to cause the heart defect observed in Down syndrome, has led to the discovery of a gene called DSCR1. DSCR1 is a negative regulator of a biological pathway which when disturbed in the heart can lead to developmental heart malformations, similar to the type seen in Down syndrome, and when over stimulated can result in the abnormal growth of the heart seen in humans with hypertension and heart disease. If we are to make rational decisions about the design of potential treatments for heart defects and disease, we firstly need to understand how these biological pathways work and how molecules such as DSCR1 regulate them. We aim to investigate how DSCR1 functions by generating mice that lack the gene, to see what happens when it is missing and mice over expressing the gene to investigate the consequences of elevated levels of DSCR1 analogous to the situation in Down syndrome."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Melanie Pritchard","data":{"first_name":"Melanie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044927","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Pritchard","source_individual_id":"5017061","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Melanie Pritchard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88630","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joseph Smolich","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033925","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Smolich","source_individual_id":"5038723","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joseph Smolich"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85784","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3140","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"NKT cells and tumour immunosurveillance","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["NK cells","tumour immunotherapy","tumour metastases"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194252,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cancer metastasis","immunology","immunotherapy of cancer","innate immunity"],"scientific_title":"NKT cells and tumour immunosurveillance","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Tumour Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Dale Godfrey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194252","simplified_title":"Anti-tumour activity of natural killer T cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"80550","source_system":"Although the immune system has the ability to reject tumours, this sometimes does not occur, leading to cancer.

The aim of this project is to investigate the functional importance of both NK and NKT cells in response to a range of different tumour types, including melanoma (skin cancer), lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma and sarcoma (connective tissue tumour). We will test the importance of each of these subsets by injecting these tumours into mice that have specific deficiencies in NK and-or NKT cells. If the NK or NKT cells are important, the tumours should grow more effectively when these immune cells are absent. We will also be able to put NK and-or NKT cells back into the mice to show directly that they are responsible for tumour rejection. Using a modification of this cell transfer approach, we will be able to inhibit special molecules that are normally produced by these cells that help them interact with other cells, and also help them attack the tumour cells. Collectively, the approaches outlined in this application allow us to determine which types of cells are important in response to a broad range of different tumour types, and also should tell us how these cells are able to attack the tumours. This information will be invaluable for the development of new strategies to use the patients immune system to attack cancer (known as immuno-therapy)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Dale Godfrey","data":{"first_name":"Dale","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025096","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Godfrey","source_individual_id":"RMIS6021","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Dale Godfrey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83449","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Smyth","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004735","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Smyth","source_individual_id":"RMIS9033","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Smyth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77987","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3137","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A Randomised controlled trial of high dose folic acid to slow the progression of atheroma in renal failure (194246)","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["cardio vascular disease","clinical trial","folic acid","intimal hyperplasia","kidney"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194246,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","cardio vascular disease","clinical trial","kidney failure"],"scientific_title":"A Randomised controlled trial of high dose folic acid to slow the progression of atheroma in renal failure (194246)","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nephrology and Urology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Barry McGrath","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194246","simplified_title":"Study of folic acid supplementation in kidney failure patients to reduce heart disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"326980","source_system":"The Atherosclerosis and Folic Acid Supplementation Trial (ASFAST) is examining the effect of high dose folic acid supplementation on the development of desease of the heart and blood vessels in people with kidney failure.

The rural industries accounted for 80 deaths annually. Best estimates place the cost of farm injury between $0.5 and $1.29 billion per year. This study is designed to contribute to farm injury prevention by: (1) identifying factors associated with a higher risk of serious injury among adult farm workers and (2) determining the proportions of the farm workforce who are exposed to various injury risks. The study will recruit 300 seriously injured or killed farm workers from regional Victoria and collect information about themselves, their working life and the property on which they work. This information will be compared with 600 randomly selected farm workers who are not seriously injured to determine which personal, work and environmental factors place farm workers at higher risk of injury. The study will lead to the development of new or more refined prevention strategies and programs. A study of this kind has not been conducted before in Australia and would contribute to a continuing scientific basis for selection of interventions for farm injury and targeting of prevention programs, at a time of increasing momentum in agricultural health and safety."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lesley Day","data":{"first_name":"Lesley","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036206","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Day","source_individual_id":"RMIS107824","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Lesley Day"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86388","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Don Voaklander","data":{"first_name":"Don","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016867","middle_name":"","last_name":"Voaklander","source_individual_id":"RMIS656737","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Don Voaklander"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81287","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Malcolm Sim","data":{"first_name":"Malcolm","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016231","middle_name":"Ross","last_name":"Sim","source_individual_id":"5011979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Malcolm Sim"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81097","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rory Wolfe","data":{"first_name":"Rory","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011139","middle_name":"St.John","last_name":"Wolfe","source_individual_id":"5018441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rory Wolfe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79728","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3135","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An examination of motor functioning in autism and Asperger's disorder: An analysis of gait & cortical brain activity.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["EEG","autism","developmental neurobiology","movement disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194238,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["autism spectrum disorders","child psychiatry","motor function"],"scientific_title":"An examination of motor functioning in autism and Asperger's disorder: An analysis of gait & cortical brain activity.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Bruce Tonge","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194238","simplified_title":"Motor functioning in autism and Asperger's disorder","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"120220","source_system":"Autism is a developmental disorder characterised by a triad of deficits: delayed and atypical language development, impaired development of social skills, and ritualistic and stereotypic behaviour. Although not part of the standard diagnosis, movement disorders and gait abnormalities have been clinically observed in autism similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease. In addition, individuals with Asperger's disorder may appear more clumsy, have a stiff or awkward way of walking, and exhibit poor coordination in posture and gesture. It has been suggested that there is disruption within the basal-ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry (the region connecting the frontal and sub-cortical structures), which may cause the motor dysfunction seen in autism and Asperger's disorder. Few studies have attempted to isolate particular stages of motor functioning which may account for the coordination and motor delay observed clinically in autism and Asperger's disorder. A recent study of ours found evidence to suggest that motor planning deficiencies may account for the 'clumsy' movement patterns frequently reported in the autism - Asperger's disorder literature. Therefore, the aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive neurobehavioural and neurophysiological analysis of motor functioning in young people with autism and Asperger's disorder to further examine the exact stages of motor processing which are deficient in these disorder groups. Recent retrospective studies have shown that even as infants children with autism exhibit clear features of motor disturbance, which, if detected and clearly defined, could advance early diagnosis. In addition to advancing the clinical definition of autism and Asperger's disorder, a careful examination of motor disturbance may also illuminate the neurobiological underpinnings of these disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr John Bradshaw","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041235","middle_name":"Lockyer","last_name":"Bradshaw","source_individual_id":"RMIS32791","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr John Bradshaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87692","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Iansek","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019803","middle_name":"","last_name":"Iansek","source_individual_id":"5015426","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Iansek"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82041","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicole Rinehart","data":{"first_name":"Nicole","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015881","middle_name":"Joan","last_name":"Rinehart","source_individual_id":"5017217","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Nicole Rinehart"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81004","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010691","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Tonge","source_individual_id":"RMIS35666","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Bruce Tonge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79601","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3133","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Characterisation of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli lacking classical virulence markers","data":{"media_summary":"microbiology-pathogenesis","end_year":2003,"keywords":["adhesion mechanisms","bacterial genetics","bacterial pathogen","host colonisation","host/pathogen interaction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194235,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["bacterial virulence factors","diarrhoeal disease","haemolytic uraemic syndrome","microbial infections","microbiology-pathogenesis"],"scientific_title":"Characterisation of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli lacking classical virulence markers","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Elizabeth Hartland","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194235","simplified_title":"Investigation of a bacterium that causes intestinal disease","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"140660","source_system":"Some intestinal infections with the intestinal bacterium, E. coli, can result in severe, often fatal, kidney disease called the haemolytic uraemic syndrome.

Children are particularly susceptible to life threatening infections with this type of E.coli and usually acquire the infection by consuming contaminated food or water. This organism is currently a global food safety problem and the bacteria are especially prevalent in ground beef products and water or vegetables that have been contaminated with cattle faeces. In this study we aim to identify new bacterial genes and proteins that may be used to improve current means of detecting and diagnosing this kind of E.coli. A great deal is known about the way in which the classical strains of this virulent E .coli colonise the intestine however a small but significant group of these organisms do not carry known colonisation factors. We aim to identify bacterial proteins in these non-classical strains of E.coli which are needed for attachment of the bacteria to the host. Identifying how these bacteria interact with the host may help us to develop improved means of detecting and diagnosing this life-threatening infection."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Hartland","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002072","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hartland","source_individual_id":"5015113","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Hartland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77233","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3131","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Adhesion","Glycoproteins","Haemostasis and thrombosis","Platelets","Signalling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194231,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Shaun Jackson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194231","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"244750","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shaun Jackson","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037493","middle_name":"Phillip","last_name":"Jackson","source_individual_id":"5011850","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Shaun Jackson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86712","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3130","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional biology of clostridial transposons","data":{"media_summary":"resistance spread","end_year":2003,"keywords":["antibiotic resistance","bacterial genetics","molecular mechanisms","site-specific recombination","transposons"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194228,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["antibiotic resistance","bacterial infections","infectious diseases","prevention of microbial antibiotic resistance development","resistance spread"],"scientific_title":"Functional biology of clostridial transposons","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Julian Rood","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194228","simplified_title":"Mode of action of mobile genetic elements from pathogenic bacteria","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"261100","source_system":"The rapid emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria that cause infectious diseases is of major concern to public health authorities throughout the world. Many of the genes that are responsible for this resistance are carried on mobile genetic elements, which are discrete segments of genetic material that can move from one bacterium to another. These genetic elements are important vehicles for the transmission of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in most bacteria. This project is centred on bacteria that cause intestinal diseases and have the potential to transfer genetic information to other bacteria that are present in the intestine. The focus will be on elucidating the mechanism of action of an enzyme encoded by two of these genetic elements. This enzyme is responsible for the movement of these elements from one site in the bacterial genome to another, by a process that is being increasingly recognised as important in antibiotic-resistant disease-causing bacteria. The project will employ the latest tools of molecular biology to determine the function of this enzyme, and its associated genetic elements, at the detailed molecular level. These studies will contribute to our understanding of how these antibiotic resistance elements are transferred within and between different bacterial cells. In the longer term the project will contribute towards the development of improved methods for the control and treatment of infectious diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Dena Lyras","data":{"first_name":"Dena","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038197","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lyras","source_individual_id":"5016113","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Dena Lyras"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86900","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julian Rood","data":{"first_name":"Julian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004318","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Rood","source_individual_id":"RMIS46068","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julian Rood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77872","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3129","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A study addressing motor, cognitive and attentional deficits in presymptomatic gene carriers for Huntington's disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Cognition and Attention Deficits","Experimental Neuropsychology","Movement Disorders","Presymptomatic Gene Carriers for Huntington's disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194219,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Gene Positive","Huntington's Disease","Preclinical"],"scientific_title":"A study addressing motor, cognitive and attentional deficits in presymptomatic gene carriers for Huntington's disease","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Nellie Georgiou-Karistianis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194219","simplified_title":"A study addressing motor, cognitive and attentional deficits in gene carriers for Huntington's disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"180330","source_system":"Since the discovery of the Huntington's disease (HD) gene mutation there has been much controversy in the literature relating to whether there are any preclinical deficits in individuals who are gene positive for HD but who have not yet been clinically diagnosed with the disease.

Examples of biological processes that require such events include the division and arrangement of cells in a developing embryo, or the ability of cancer cells to spread (metastasise). A driving force behind the attachment or movement of cells is their ability to rearrange a scaffolding called the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is similar to the skeleton of the human body, in that it acts to maintain cell shape and rigidity. However, it is also actively reorganised to participate in many cellular processes, including cell attachment and movement. By furthering our understanding of how the cytoskeleton is rearranged, this will provide important insights not only into the basics of cell behaviour, but will also have important implications for a number of human disease states. This proposal aims to investigate mechanisms that regulate the reorganisation of the cytoskeleton. It is well established that the rearrangement of this scaffolding, in many different types of cells, is controlled by a family of proteins called the Rho family of small GTPases. One of the members of this family, RhoA, has a specific role in controlling cell attachment, and interestingly, has been implicated in the invasive and metastatic properties of human tumour cells. We have recently identified a protein that is responsible for controlling the activation of RhoA. This proposal aims to further our understanding of how this protein regulates RhoA, and therefore cell attachment and movement.

The inflammation is caused by white blood cells attacking the lining of blood vessels in tissues. The aim of this project is to understand the reasons why these white blood cells attack the blood vessel lining. This process is impossible to study in humans. However, there is a strain of mouse which is affected by a disease which is very similar to human lupus. This disease occurs spontaneously in these mice. Using a microscope, it is possible to study the tiny blood vessels which are affected by this disease in these mice . Under the microscope, it is possible to see the white blood cells as they undergo the process of attacking the blood vessel lining. Visualizing this attack then allows us to study it and determine which molecules are important in causing this damaging inflammatory response. Specifically I will examine diseased blood vessels in the skin and brain of these mice, two of the tissues most dramatically affected by this disease. This information should help us gain an increased understanding of lupus as it affects humans."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael

Grant","total_budget":"467126.72","source_system":"HIV-1 infection is characterised by high levels of virus replication and a progressive loss of immune cells, particularly CD4+ T lymphocytes. Highly active antiretrovial therapy (HAART) for HIV-1 infection results in profound suppression of viral replication, a substantial increase in CD4+ T lymphocytes and a decrease in morbidity and mortality. The primary source of T lymphocytes in early human development is the thymus. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the thymus remains functional throughout adult life. The role of the thymus in HIV-1 infection remains controversial. Studies of the role of the thymus in HIV-1-infected individuals has been limited by the lack of a marker of thymic function in vivo. We have recently developed a novel assay to quantify cells of recent thymic origin by taking advantage of certain molecular events that occur in the thymus during the production of new T lymphocytes. This molecular event creates a circular piece of DNA, called a T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC). TREC concentration in the periphery will increase with an increase in thymic output but will reduce in the presence of T cell proliferation or cell death. In order to determine the contribution of the thymus to immune reconstitution following HAART, we plan to study the dynamics of thymus function in HIV-1 infection by measuring TREC and T cell turnover in HIV-1 infection prior to and following HAART. In a subgroup of individuals, more commonly seen following treatment of HIV-1 infection in children, there is an increase in CD4+ T lymphocytes in the absence of a significant reduction in viral suppression. The role of the thymus in this unique subset of individuals will be studied."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sharon Lewin","data":{"first_name":"Sharon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026261","middle_name":"Ruth","last_name":"Lewin","source_individual_id":"5012107","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Sharon Lewin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83788","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2494","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Elucidation of mechanisms by which fibre promotes or protects from colorectal tumorigenesis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Butyrate","Colorectal tumorigenesis","Dietary fibre","Faecal water","Mechanisms of action"],"nhmrc_grant_id":145784,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Cancer prevention","Colorectal cancer","Diet"],"scientific_title":"Elucidation of mechanisms by which fibre promotes or protects from colorectal tumorigenesis","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof PETER GIBSON","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/145784","simplified_title":"Determining how fibre works in affecting the development colon cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"In a carefully controlled animal model of colon cancer development, dietary fibre can increase or decrease the likelihood of colon cancer development. It depends upon the type of fibre being fed to the animal. The mechanisms by which fibres can increase or decrease the likelihood of colon cancer developing are, however, poorly understood. In this proposal, we will attempt to elucidate at least some of the mechanisms. We plan to define whether animals consuming fibres that increase cancer development have factors in their faeces that affect the health of the cells that line the colon (the ones that form the cancers). This will be examined in both the test tube and in healthy rats. Whether fibres influence the access of these factors to the lining cells by sequestering or hiding the factors in the jelly-like consistency some fibres produce in the colon will also be examined. The results will help identify conditions in the faeces that alter the susceptibility of colons to developing cancer. By identifying these conditions, we can then apply our knowledge to human subjects, so that we might be able to identify those at a higher or lower risk of developing colon cancer and we can advise and (subsequently prove) ways of modifying diet to reduce the risk of colon cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter

This relates relates integrally to cellular processes such as growth, development and oncogenesis. This research area is not represented elsewhere in Australia, and the particular experimental strategies to approach the problem, revolving around the use of special quantitative microscopic techniques are novel internationally. One part of the application seeks to examine transport within the cell of complexes of interacting proteins, rather than single proteins, under as close as possible to physiologically relevant conditions. This will be truly unique, and of great importance to our comprehension of eukaryotic cell function. This application examines particular types of negative control over protein nuclear localization. Since many proteins show such regulation, and in particular important proteins controlling cell growth and division, the results are fundamentally important to our understanding of how cells function in general. Further, this understanding may be applied in disease situations, such as viral-mediated oncogenesis. In the work we propose to do, viral proteins with functions relating to cancer will be examined in detail, as well as a cellular protein which is recognised by them - the tumor suppressor Rb. We intend to examine several viral oncoproteins which target Rb; one is a protein (E7) from the Human Papilloma Virus which has been frequently associated with cervical carcinomas and other cancers. Accordingly, the results may have direct application to viral-induced cancer, and our work may lead to understanding of the regulation of protein transport to the nucleus. This may thus afford a new approach at the pharmacological level to combat transformation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Jans","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025750","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Jans","source_individual_id":"5015477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Jans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2390","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) and p53 in rheumatoid arthritis .","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["cytokine","fibroblast-like synoviocytes","macrophage migration inhibitory factor","p53","proliferation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143707,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["arthritis,rheumatoid","drug therapy","synovium"],"scientific_title":"Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) and p53 in rheumatoid arthritis .","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rheumatology and Arthritis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Michelle Leech","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143707","simplified_title":"Cytokines and tumour suppressor genes in rheumatoid arthritis.","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"333055.08","source_system":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease affecting approximately 1% of the population. It is characterised by severe inflammation and destruction of joints resulting in significant health problems. The lining tissue of joints is known to be infiltrated by inflammatory cells. In addition to this infiltration of inflammatory cells, there is overgrowth of the normal lining cells of joints. These overgrowing cells contribute significantly to joint damage by invading cartilage and bone and allowing inflammatory cells to reach these areas. The abnormal growth of these cells has been related to the malfunction of certain genes that usually restrain abnormal growth. These genes called tumour suppressor genes are known to be damaged in joint lining cells derived from RA. The best known of these abnormal tumour suppressor genes is called p 53. The product of the p53 gene, the p 53 protein, is particularly important in slowing down the growth of cells. The applicant has recently shown that an inflammatory product called MIF is released in large quantities by joint lining cells in RA. Previous studies by the applicant have shown that blocking MIF using an antibody almost completely prevents arthritis development in a rat model. These studies indicate that MIF is likely to be an important contributor to disease in RA. Recent preliminary studies in the applicant s laboratory have shown that MIF can decrease p53 levels in joint lining cells from RA patients and also that MIF can increase the growth rate of these cells. These preliminary data indicate that MIF may contribute significantly to disease in RA by overriding control of normal cell growth by p53. Confirmation and full exploration of the regulation of p53 expression and function by MIF may highlight a novel way to treat the excessive growth and invasion by joint lining cells which characterises RA."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michelle Leech","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037978","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Leech","source_individual_id":"5015904","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Michelle Leech"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86839","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2388","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional characterisation of regulators of human globin gene switching","data":{"media_summary":"Thalassaemia","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Erythropoiesis","Gene knockout","Globin genes","Transcription factors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143701,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["C/EBP","EKLF","Globin","Sickle cell anaemia","Thalassaemia"],"scientific_title":"Functional characterisation of regulators of human globin gene switching","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Andrew Perkins","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143701","simplified_title":"Detailed dissection of the effector proteins that regulate haemoglobin switching","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"232131.72","source_system":"Red blood cells produce haemoglobin, a tetramer of two alpha globin chains and two beta-globin chains. Haemoglobin reversibly interacts with oxygen in such a way that it efficiently shuttles oxygen between the lungs and the rest of the body. Integrity of the hemoglobin molecule, and red cells which carry it, is essential for life of all organisms with blood. The alpha-globin and beta-globin chains that make up haemoglobin are prodcued by red cell precursors in the bone marrow according to the genetic blueprint (genes) that are inherited. Genetic disorders resulting from defects in the beta-globin gene are the most common inherited disorders of man. Children who fail to make beta-globin have a disease known as beta-thalassaemia. They are transfusion dependent from ~ 6 months of age and need intensive chelation therapy (infusions) to avoid the serious consequnces of iron overload. The average life expectancy in Western cultures is ~ 30 years. There is no cure. In third world countries where a reliable blood supply is unavailable, death occurs earlier. Patients are aften infected with blood born viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and the AIDS virus, HIV. Sickle cell anaemia is also a very common disease. It is due to a single DNA base mutation at in the beta-globin gene that results in production of normal amounts of a defective beta-globin molecule (HbS). In low oxygen, HbS molecules polymerize in red cells and irreversibly damage them. These red cells get trapped in small blood capillaries throughout the circulation causing small infarcts which results in severe pain and organ damage. The life expectancy is <2 years in the thrid world and ~20-30 years in the west. The irony of these two diseases is that there is a perfectly normal fetal globin gene that has been silenced during fetal life. This grant aims to understand the mechanism of the switch from fetal to adult globin gene usage so it can be reversed in adults with b-thalassemia and sickle cell disease"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Perkins","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033140","middle_name":"Charles","last_name":"Perkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS216814","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Perkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85587","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2387","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of regulatory genes in the gastrointestinal pathogen, Clostridium difficile","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Microarray technology","Microbial genetics","Microbial toxins","Regulation","Two-component signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143700,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Gastrointestinal diseases","Nosocomial infections","Psuedomembraneous colitis"],"scientific_title":"Role of regulatory genes in the gastrointestinal pathogen, Clostridium difficile","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Julian Rood","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143700","simplified_title":"Control of gene expression in a bacterium that causes intestinal disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"287036.72","source_system":"When patients are treated in hospital with antibiotics they sometimes develop chronic diarrhoea or colitis syndromes that are very difficult and expensive to treat. This project involves the analysis of the bacterium that generally causes these gastrointestinal diseases. We know that this microorganism is present in the hospital environment and that it produces potent protein toxins that are responsible for these diseases but we know little about the actual disease process. In most bacteria that cause disease there are regulatory networks that control the expression of the genes responsible for the disease process. In this project, we aim to develop an understanding of how these regulatory networks operate in this particular bacterium. The latest techniques of molecular biology will be used to investigate several specific regulatory genes at the functional level. Since the entire DNA sequence of this bacterium is now known we will also use a broader research approach that makes use of this knowledge to examine all of potential regulatory networks that exist in this bacterium. Finally, we will develop new methods for the genetic analysis of the causative bacterium so that we will be better able to elucidate the role of specific genes in the disease process. By understanding how this bacterium controls the production of the proteins that interact with human intestinal cells to cause disease we hope to be able to prevent such diseases from occurring. The successful completion of the project therefore will make a major contribution to the development of improved methods for the control and treatment of these chromic diarrhoea and colitis syndromes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julian Rood","data":{"first_name":"Julian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004318","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Rood","source_individual_id":"RMIS46068","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julian Rood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77872","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2386","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The molecular basis to the development and function of the thymic microenvironment.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["epithelium","genes","microenvironment","molecules","thymus"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143682,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["autoimmunity","immunodeficiency","transplantation tolerance"],"scientific_title":"The molecular basis to the development and function of the thymic microenvironment.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Richard Boyd","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143682","simplified_title":"The molecular basis to the thymic microenvironment.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"227036.72","source_system":"The ability of the body to defend itself against infection is dependent on white cells in the blood called T lymphocytes, so-named because they are produced in the thymus gland.

Understanding the genetic and thus molecular basis to this will be very important biologically but may also provide more sophisticated stratgies for treating diseases on T cell origin."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ann Chidgey","data":{"first_name":"Ann","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029930","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Chidgey","source_individual_id":"RMIS423925","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Ann Chidgey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84748","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Boyd","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017852","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Boyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS8290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Boyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81554","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2385","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigation of shear-sensitive signalling pathways in human platelets","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Calcium mobilisation","Glycoprotein Ib/V/IX","Integrin alpha IIb beta 3","Platelet adhesion under flow","von Willebrand factor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143678,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Cardiovascular disease","Haemostasis","Thrombosis"],"scientific_title":"Investigation of shear-sensitive signalling pathways in human platelets","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Shaun Jackson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143678","simplified_title":"Platelet activation under flow","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"Platelets are extremely important cells that control bleeding by sticking to injured blood vessels to form a blood clot. Excessive clotting can lead to fatal vascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. On the other hand, defects in blood clotting can result in life threatening bleeding problems. Platelets stick to the wall of a blood vessel when receptors on the surface of these cells interact with materials (ligands) that are exposed when the vessel wall is injured. The stickiness or adhesive behaviour of platelets is controlled by many proteins (enzymes) which are contained inside these cells. These enzymes transmit messages from platelet receptors on the surface into the cell interior, thereby controlling platelet behaviour. We are in the process of identifying several types of enzymes which are responsible for controlling platelet stickiness. Our research will provide a better understanding of the complicated pathways regulating platelet stickiness and clot formation.

Novel therapies are therefore required to help alleviate this disease and perhaps eradicate it. Immunotherapy - using the body's own defence system to help fight cancer- is one potential form of new treatment.

Elevated blood glucose levels following a meal stimulate the pancreas to release insulin into the circulation. Insulin acts to reduce blood sugar levels by stimulating the uptake of glucose into fat and muscle and suppressing glucose production by the liver. Defects in insulin action in these tissues are the primary cause of Type II diabetes. The debilitating effects of Type II diabetes, the dramatic increase its incidence, and the expense of treating the symptoms of diabetic complications have lead to the realization that the disease represents a major health problem requiring substantial research and development efforts. The project will focus on insulin regulation of glucose uptake in fat cells. Insulin promotes glucose uptake into fat by activating an intracellular signaling pathway that triggers the translocation of a unique glucose transporter protein (Glut4) from storage sites inside the cell to the cell surface. Glut4 translocation is mediated by small membrane vesicles that function to sequester the glucose transporter inside cells in the absence of insulin, and to shuttle Glut4 to the cell surface in response to the hormone. Despite the central importance of this event to the maintenance of normal blood glucose levels, it is poorly understood. The studies will be directed towards investigating the cellular machinery involved in the latter stages of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake- the vesicle-mediated delivery of Glut4 to the cell surface. The objective of these studies is to better understand the molecular basis for Glut4 translocation, and regulation by the insulin signaling cascade. Accomplishment of this goal may suggest potential drug intervention strategies aimed at enhancing insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and promoting improved control of blood glucose levels in Type II diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rodney Devenish","data":{"first_name":"Rodney","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042016","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Devenish","source_individual_id":"5014302","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rodney Devenish"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87896","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Tony Rowe","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009990","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rowe","source_individual_id":"RMIS374012","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Tony Rowe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79415","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2382","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigation of the mechanisms involved in consolidation of memory by beta 3 adrenoceptoragonists.","data":{"media_summary":"memory disorders","end_year":2003,"keywords":["distribution of beta 3 adrenoceptors in the brain","glucose uptake and memory formation","involvement of noradrenaline in memory","memory consolidation","molecular pharmacology of beta-3 adrenoceptors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143664,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","aging","diabetes","diseases with cognitive deficits","memory disorders"],"scientific_title":"Investigation of the mechanisms involved in consolidation of memory by beta 3 adrenoceptoragonists.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurosciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Marie Gibbs","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143664","simplified_title":"Beta 3-adrenoceptors and memory consolidation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"241018.36","source_system":"The inability to form new memories is a major and increasingly prevalent health problem for an aging population. In addition to aging, the inability to form new memories is associated with serious medical conditions including Alzheimer's Disease and diabetes. Common to these conditions is the inability to consolidate memories. Memories are intact for a short while (30 minutes) after the event to be remembered, but memory does not pass on into permanent storage. We have been able to achieve memory consolidation in a particular learning task, which is not normally remembered, by injection of drugs acting on novel receptors (beta 3 adrenoceptors) in the brain of day old chicks. These drugs mimic the action of noradrenaline at beta-3 adrenoceptors. There are a number of ways in which memory consolidation can be enhanced, and we will compare the effects of beta-3 drugs with other potential drugs acting at other types of noradrenaline receptors. One of the actions of beta-3 agonists is related to the uptake of glucose into cells in the brain. We will investigate whether the mechanism of beta-3 enhancement of memory involves the uptake of glucose in brain tissue and studies in cultures of individual cell types will show us which cells are involved. Although this work is done using young chicks, there is no reason to suppose that the basic memory mechanisms at the level of the nerve cell should be different in birds or mammals. There are distinct advantages to using chicks in this research as they can form a long lasting memory for an experience lasting only 10 seconds, and they will discriminate between different colours as part of their learning. This research is aimed at understanding the processes involved in and influencing memory formation. If we are going to develop drugs to alleviate the cognitive problems of old age and more serious cognitive diseases, we need to understand more about the basic mechanisms of memory formation in the normal animal."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roger Summers","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016511","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Summers","source_individual_id":"5017774","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Roger Summers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81186","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Marie Gibbs","data":{"first_name":"Marie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007466","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Gibbs","source_individual_id":"RMIS158504","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Marie Gibbs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78718","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2381","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Supply, demand and the distribution of health services in Australia","data":{"media_summary":"Population Health","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Access impact of changing doctor supply","Geographic distribution of doctor supply","Health impact of changing doctor supply","Price impact of changing doctor supply"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143662,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Access","Distribution of doctors","Doctor supply","Health econometrics","Population Health"],"scientific_title":"Supply, demand and the distribution of health services in Australia","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health Economics","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"ECONOMICS","cia_name":"Prof Jeff Richardson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143662","simplified_title":"Supply, demand and the distribution of health services in Australia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"308037.99","source_system":"The distribution of medical services and its impact on access and equity is widely recognised as a key concern of the Australian community.

Alternative control measures are urgently needed and this project focuses on developing a better understanding of how the malaria parasite functions. If important processes such as red blood cell invasion can be understood in detail then it becomes possible to identify proteins essential for survival of the parasite. These could then be used as a vaccine against the disease. Current work suggests that the vaccine will be need more than one parasite protein and it becomes essential to identify the best combination of components. The parasite protein called MSP1 is thought to be a very promising candidate, but it is insufficiently active on its own. We have recently discovered a new protein in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, that is similar to MSP1. We would like to know more about this protein and determine if it may be a useful addition to MSP1 for a vaccine. This project intends to further characterize the properties of this new protein including its role in red blood cell invasion and to examine whether immunization with the rodent malaria form of the protein is able to protect mice against malaria infection. The results of this project will be highly significant in the field of malaria vaccine development and will indicate whether this new protein will be a useful component of the eventual malaria vaccine."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Coppel","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012469","middle_name":"Leon","last_name":"Coppel","source_individual_id":"RMIS69215","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Coppel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80068","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Casilda Black","data":{"first_name":"Casilda","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011830","middle_name":"Gabrielle","last_name":"Black","source_individual_id":"RMIS424328","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Casilda Black"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79904","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2379","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Estrogen - A Potential New Treatment for Women & Men with Schizophrenia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Antipsychotic drugs","Clinical trial","Estrogen","Schizophrenia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143654,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Men's Mental Health","Schizophrenia","Women's Mental Health"],"scientific_title":"Estrogen - A Potential New Treatment for Women & Men with Schizophrenia","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Jayashri Kulkarni","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143654","simplified_title":"Can Estrogen be used as a treatment for people with schizophrenia?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"227545.9","source_system":"Estrogen - the major female hormone, has been shown in animal studies to decrease the two main brain chemicals (dopamine and serotonin) that are implicated in causing schizophrenia.

Within minutes, the region of the brain that is receiving no blood flow, dies and so the functions controlled by that region cease. If this region controls key functions such as breathing then the patient dies and this occurs in about one third of patients. However, in the majority of patients, the blockage affects parts of the brain controlling movement of limbs or speech and so these patients suffer permanent disabilities. Not surprisingly, stroke is the most common life-threatening neurological disease and the major cause of disability in adults over 45. Apart from the profound effect stroke has on the patient and the family, the annual cost of disability to the Australian community is approx $ 1 billion. If the disability could be minimised by reducing institutionalization then the cost saving would be great. Research is being carried out to define how nerves die when they have insufficient blood supply and progress has been made in understanding the biochemical basis of this process. Such knowledge opens the way for the design of novel drugs to delay nerve death. Our laboratory has been successful in designing a novel drug, AM-36 that minimises nerve death in the forebrain of rats that have had the blood supply to the forebrain interrupted for 3 to 5 hours. A recent report has shown that a stroke in the forebrain can lead to nerve damage in the spinal cord and this could contribute to impaired walking in stroke patients. This is an unexpected finding and this project seeks to define how and when nerves in the spine die after a stroke in the forebrain. Such information should then lead to the rational design of drugs to minimise the death of nerves in the spinal cord as well as in the forebrain."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bevyn Jarrott","data":{"first_name":"Bevyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043281","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jarrott","source_individual_id":"RMIS188964","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bevyn Jarrott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88213","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2376","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular mechanisms of nitric oxide modulation of calcium-activated potassium channels in smooth muscle","data":{"media_summary":"persistent pulmonary hypertension in infants","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Intestinal and vascular smooth muscle","Ion channels in smooth muscle","Nitric oxide and redox agents","Site directed mutagenesis of channel protein amino acids","Smooth muscle electrophysiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143619,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["aspiration syndrome in infants","endothelial dysfunction during atherosclerosis","hormone therapy in women","myocardial infarction and cardio- pulmonary endotoxins","persistent pulmonary hypertension in infants"],"scientific_title":"Molecular mechanisms of nitric oxide modulation of calcium-activated potassium channels in smooth muscle","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Richard Lang","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143619","simplified_title":"Nitric oxide control of Ca-activated K channels in smooth muscle","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"411622.54","source_system":"The inappropriate production of nitric oxide (NO) is increasingly being linked to the pathogenesis of numerous disease states such as septic shock, hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage, anti-microbial defense and inflammation. In mammalian visceral smooth muscle organs, the release of NO plays an essential role in the processes that underlie the endothelial-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, as well as the relaxation of many smooth muscles evoked upon stimulation of intrinsic non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory motor nerves. It is becoming clear that the inappropriate release of NO may also contribute to a number of disorders of visceral organs. In fact, NO donors and NO synthesis blockers are presently being tested in >15 NIH sponsored clinical trials of treatments of such disparate diseases as acute myocardial infarction, endothelial dysfunction during atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease, aspiration syndrome or persistent pulmonary hypertension in infants, and hormone therapy in postmenopausal women. This project represents a unique international collaboration of Drs Lang (Monash Uni.) and Neylon (Baker Inst.) with Dr Reinhart (Duke Uni.)(Neylon et al 1999). We intend to establish the precise site and mechanisms of action of NO on both naturally occurring and artificially reconstructed K channels obtained from intestinal and vascular smooth muscle. These experiments will for the first time establish the molecular site of NO action on the K channels that set the membrane potential and excitability of smooth muscle.

These proteases act primarily to degrade other proteins, mainly in the extracellular space, which in turn allow cells to move around, wounds to close, and blood clots to disappear. The plasminogen activating system is one of the most important enzyme systems involved in these events. One of the proteases that cleaves plasminogen to its active form, plasmin, is urokinase (u-PA). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) is a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits u-PA activity. The degree of u-PA activity therefore depends on the relative levels of u-PA and PAI-2. In addition to controlling u-PA activity, PAI-2 also influences intracellular events including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. PAI-2 protein and mRNA levels are substantially modulated by many cytokines and growth factors. This project addresses the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of PAI-2 gene expression. We have recently shown that a significant degree of PAI-2 regulation occurs at the level of PAI-2 mRNA stability, and we have identified two regions within the PAI-2 mRNA that play a role in this process. Both regions provide binding sites for cellular proteins. We have identified one of these binding proteins to be HuR, a protein that has recently been shown to control the stability of other mRNAs. The specific aims of this project are firstly, to determine the role of HuR in the control of PAI-2 mRNA stability, and secondly, to clone a characterise the other PAI-2 mRNA binding proteins we have identifed. An understanding of how cells modulate levels of PAI-2 mRNA will significantly add to the broader field of gene regulation and may also provide new clues to influence PAI-2 levels in the body."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Hong Yu","data":{"first_name":"Hong","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0046483","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yu","source_individual_id":"RMIS428558","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Hong Yu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89040","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Medcalf","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014929","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Medcalf","source_individual_id":"5016415","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Medcalf"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80745","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2372","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Determining the function of parasite proteins at the membrane skeleton of malaria-infected red blood cells","data":{"media_summary":"Vector-borne diseases","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Cell adhesion","Membrane mechanics","Modification of red blood cells by malaria parasites","Plasmodium falciparum","Red blood cell membrane skeleton"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143608,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Anaemia","Cerebral malaria","Falciparum malaria","Parasitic diseases","Vector-borne diseases"],"scientific_title":"Determining the function of parasite proteins at the membrane skeleton of malaria-infected red blood cells","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Parasitology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Brian Cooke","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143608","simplified_title":"Determining the function of parasite proteins in malaria-infected red blood cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"392036.72","source_system":"Malaria is a serious disease that frequently kills its victim after a bout of high fever and coma. The most vicious form of malaria is caused by a minute parasite called Plasmodium falciparum that lives inside red blood cells. As these parasites grow, they make some dramatic renovations to their red blood cell home that make it become very stiff and sticky. Instead of flowing around the body like normal red blood cells, the infected cells become trapped in small veins and can no longer carry out their normal job. The ability of the parasite to make red blood cells stiff and sticky is what makes this type of malaria so dangerous, particularly when red cells get stuck in the brain. We plan to look at certain proteins that malaria parasites place on the walls of red blood cells because we think this is what makes them stiff and sticky.

The kidneys play a critical role in control of blood pressure under normal conditions, and probably also in the initiation and maintenance of high blood pressure. This influence is exerted both through the excretion of salt and water, and by the release of substances into the circulation that affect blood pressure (hormones). Recent experiments performed by us and others have indicated that the inner part of the kidney (the medulla) is critical in these functions, which appear to be regulated by the level of blood flow in the medulla of the kidney. Our recent experiments also show that hormones and nerves have diverse effects on blood flow in the different regions of the kidney, showing that these factors can differentially affect blood pressure depending on their effects on medullary blood flow. Importantly, these hormones and nerves do not act in isolation, but act in concert, and in association with so called 'second messenger' systems that act locally to directly affect the contraction of muscle in blood vessels, and so blood vessel size. The experiments described in this application are aimed at determining how circulating and locally acting hormones, and the nerves in the kidney, interact together to control blood flow in the different regions of the kidney. This will help us understand how blood flow to the medulla of the kidney is regulated normally, so that we can begin to understand how malfunction of these systems can contribute to the development of high blood pressure."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Simon Malpas","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038261","middle_name":"","last_name":"Malpas","source_individual_id":"5033314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Simon Malpas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86909","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Roger Evans","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018903","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Evans","source_individual_id":"5011298","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Roger Evans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81839","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2370","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cytoskeletal regulation of platelet adhesion and thrombus formation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Actin","Cell adhesion receptors","Cytoskeleton","Platelet","Thrombus formation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143569,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Cardiovascular disease","Haemostasis","Thrombosis"],"scientific_title":"Cytoskeletal regulation of platelet adhesion and thrombus formation","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Hatem Salem","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143569","simplified_title":"Regulation of thrombus formation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"406527.54","source_system":"Platelets are small specialised blood cells that are essential for normal blood clotting and repair of damaged blood vessels following injury.

Angiotensin II causes these excitatory effects by acting at particular target sites called AT1 receptors. Drugs called AT1 receptor antagonists are known to block these excitatory actions of angiotensin II at AT1 receptors. Consequently, these compounds lower blood pressure in humans because they block the ongoing stimulatory action of angiotensin II. However, it is now thought that angiotensin II may also be able to act at another target site (AT2 receptor) to cause opposite effects, i.e. decrease blood pressure and inhibit growth effects. Therefore, this project will examine if direct stimulation of AT2 sites can alter blood flows measured in different body regions in hypertensive rats as part of their mechanism to lower blood pressure. In addition, the effects of continuous stimulation of the AT2 site will be examined in hypertensive rats which will be implanted with a radiotransmitter to measure blood pressure without interference, and afterwards, structural measurements of the heart and blood vessels will be made. Additionally, this project will investigate whether stimulation of the AT2 site also contributes to the blood pressure-lowering effect of drugs already mentioned (AT1 receptor antagonists). The rationale for this is that the hormone angiotensin II is still 'free' to act at the AT2 site, even with AT1 receptors being blocked, and lower blood pressure. These studies will determine if stimulation of AT2 sites contributes to the beneficial effects (i.e. decreased blood pressure and decreased cardiovascular growth) of AT1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of high blood pressure. More importantly, these findings may also identify a new therapeutic target site (AT2 receptor) for drug development in the treatment of cardiovascular disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Widdop","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022976","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Widdop","source_individual_id":"5018294","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Widdop"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82922","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2368","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Fetal Response to Infection, with Particular Reference to Alterations of Tryptophan Metabolism","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Excitotoxicity and neuroprotection","Fetal hypoxia and birth trauma","Maternal infection","Neuroactive metabolites of tryptophan catabolism","Perinatal brain damage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143559,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Fetal response to infection","Maternal infection","Pregnancy complications and newborn health"],"scientific_title":"The Fetal Response to Infection, with Particular Reference to Alterations of Tryptophan Metabolism","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr David Walker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143559","simplified_title":"Brain Damage at Birth, and its Relationship to Maternal Infection and Nutrition.","sub_type":"Standard Project with Research Fellowship","total_budget":"410616.8","source_system":"Infection in pregnancy has long been known to be associated with a high risk for brain damage in the baby. There is now good evidence that the brain can be damaged before birth, and in other babies where the brain is damaged after birth there is reason to say that these infants were factors associated with the pregnancy that rendered them vulnerable to risk factors postnatally. Very little is known about the effects of infection on the fetus. Some recent work has shown that substances released from bacteria induce cells in the uterus and placenta to produce inflammatory chemicals that can damage the brain. In this project we propose the following model: 1), infection causes the release of substances from the uterus and placenta that disrupt the blood-brain barrier in the fetal brain; and, 2), infection alters the metabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan in the fetus, causing greater production of metabolites that have toxic effects on the developing brain. We have preliminary evidence to support these two proposals. If the idea is proven correct, it should be possible to administer simple analogues of tryptophan to prevent the toxic metabolites of this amino acid from increasing in the fetus when either the mother or the uterus becomes infected. Because these substances can be given by mouth, this would allow a simple treatment to be developed for women at risk of infection, or who are already infected. This would be particularly useful wherever medical services and resources are limited, as for under-priviledged groups and in Third World countries."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Katarzyna Dziegielewska","data":{"first_name":"Katarzyna","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0042183","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dziegielewska","source_individual_id":"RMIS412279","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Katarzyna Dziegielewska"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87939","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Walker","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022785","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"5018162","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82870","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr George Smythe","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016324","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Smythe","source_individual_id":"RMIS133276","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr George Smythe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81132","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2367","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Output Pathways of the Basal Ganglia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Anatomy of the Basal Ganglia","Electrophysiology","Histochemistry","Movement Disorders","Neuronal tracing"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143553,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Motor Control","Movement Disorders","Nervous System Disorders","Parkinsons Disease"],"scientific_title":"The Output Pathways of the Basal Ganglia","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Malcolm Horne","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143553","simplified_title":"The Output of the Basal Ganglia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"256700.45","source_system":"Parkinson's Disease is caused by injury to a group of brain cells called the Basal Ganglia.

This project is based on the hypothesis that antibodies to collagen type II, which transfer arthritis in mice, are those that react specifically with regions of the collagen fibrils that are crucial for cartilage stability and function. We plan to test this hypothesis in an in vitro system using cultured cartilage. We predict, based on our preliminary data, that antibodies to collagen II from mice with CIA will interfere with the normal assembly and structure of cartilage. We will test this by adding antibodies under precisely defined conditions to cultured cartilage, and analysing the matrix that is synthesised. The study would then be extended to RA with a comparison of the regions of collagen II that react with antibodies of mouse and human origin. Showing that antibodies to collagen II are directly destructive, allowing for an understanding of their site and mode of action, would greatly advance our understanding of the cause of RA and would lead to more effective forms of treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Marie-Paule Van Damme","data":{"first_name":"Marie-Paule","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028532","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Van Damme","source_individual_id":"RMIS411826","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Marie-Paule Van Damme"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84381","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Merrill Rowley","data":{"first_name":"Merrill","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015983","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Rowley","source_individual_id":"RMIS97888","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Merrill Rowley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81027","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2364","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of urotensin II, a novel vasoconstrictor factor, in cardiovascular disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Cell culture","Forearm blood flow","Urotensin II"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143548,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Chronic heart failure","Essential hypertension","Post-myocardial infarction"],"scientific_title":"Role of urotensin II, a novel vasoconstrictor factor, in cardiovascular disease","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Henry Krum","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143548","simplified_title":"Urotensin II in cardiovascular disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196018.36","source_system":"Urotensin II (UII) is a newly discovered peptide that may play an important role in human health and disease.

However, little is known about the underlying processes that form the follicles containing the developing germ cells and the matured oocytes needed for IVF. The cohort of oocytes that can be harvested from any patient depends on unknown recruitment processes initiating development of a subset of the quiescent germ cells and happens in an unregulated and spontaneous manner. The present project will identify the known and unknown genes involved in recruitment of oocytes from the basal primordial population. These genes will become candidates for aiding infertile women, improving their response to fertility drugs, the development of novel contraceptive methods and potentially increasing the reproductive life span of women. Knowledge of the genes expressed in oocytes matured in vivo and in vitro will have an important bearing on the long-term opportunity to use fertility drugs in vitro instead of administration to patients for IVF. This would dramatically reduce the cost of IVF and the side-effects of hyperstimulation of ovaries of patients and the associated sequelae.

Enzymes or kinases that modify these membrane lipids in particular an enzyme known as the PI 3-kinase generate potent signalling molecules that regulate cell growth. It has been shown by many studies that signals generated by the PI 3-kinase are amplified in certain human cancers. Inherited cancer syndromes have been described in which the cell has lost the ability to switch off these lipid messenger molecules. The current project aims to investigate two recently identified enzymes called 5-phosphases that have the ability to terminate PI 3-kinase membrane signals. Both these enzymes were isolated and characterized by the host laboratory and it is predicted they will play distinct roles in the cell. The 72 kDa 5-phosphatase is predicted to regulate protein and vesicular trafficking to the surface of cell. This proposal aims to investigate if the 72 kDa 5-phosphatase can regulate the intracellular sorting of new proteins within the cell. We have also noted the 72 kDa 5-phosphatase may play a role in the development of the nervous system in particular the ability of nerves to send branches out and differentiate. This proposal will investigate this hypothesis. The second enzyme that we have isolated is a 52 kDa 5-phosphatase. This enzyme is present in many cells. We have compelling evidence that the enzyme forms a complex with a recently decribed protein called SODD that stops cells from dying in response to inappropropirate signals. We predict the 52 kDa 5-phosphatase may function to prevent prolonged cell survival as is observed in cancer. We will investigate if this enzyme regulates the cell death pathway and if increased or decreased levels of the 52 kDa 5-phosphatase alter cell survival"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christina Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Christina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032628","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christina Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85449","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2358","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Potential roles of 5-hydroxytryptamine in diseases affecting the colon","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["5-HT4 agonists","5-HT4 receptor","5-hydroxytryptamine","diseases of the colon","human colon"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143509,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["diseases of the large intestine","diverticulitis","irritable bowel disease","severe idiopathic constipation"],"scientific_title":"Potential roles of 5-hydroxytryptamine in diseases affecting the colon","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Ian Coupar","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143509","simplified_title":"Is 5-hydroxytryptamine involved in diseases affecting the large intestine?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"346018.36","source_system":"The overall aim of this project is to examine the biological roles played by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the human colon. 5-HT is a naturally occurring substance of the body, normally involved in controlling many body activities.

The conditions that are the focus of this project are chronic constipation, diverticular disease and irritable bowel syndrome. It is a matter of concern that there are no specific treatments for these conditions to date, hence the thrust of the project is to increase knowledge in this area, so hopefully treatments will be developed. Our Pharmacology research group is recognised for its experience in defining drug effects on the intestine and in characterising the target sites on which they act. This has been achieved by using an integrated approach whereby different functional methods reliably detect effects at the levels of the muscle layers, the nerves that supply them and at the absorptive surface using experimental animals. In addition, the use of isolated pieces of human colon obtained from discarded operation material has been an invaluable inclusion into this process. This has allowed us to establish that 5-HT has a target site in the muscle of the colon and that this leads to relaxation and inhibition of the normal spontaneous contractile activity, said anecdotally to be abnormally high in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We now wish to apply this expertise and knowledge to test whether 5-HT is involved in causing chronic constipation and diverticular disease and to design a drug that would be expected to be of value in treating patients with irritable bowel syndrome."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ian Coupar","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0036029","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Coupar","source_individual_id":"RMIS3637978","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Ian Coupar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86339","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Magdy Iskander","data":{"first_name":"Magdy","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0002379","middle_name":"","last_name":"Iskander","source_individual_id":"RMIS38727","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Magdy Iskander"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77316","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2357","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Thalamic and basal forebrain contributions to auditory cortical reorganization produced by partial hearing loss","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Auditory cortex","Basal forebrain","Hearing loss","Neural plasticity","Thalamus"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143508,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Cochlear prosthesis","Hearing aid","Hearing loss","Partial deafness"],"scientific_title":"Thalamic and basal forebrain contributions to auditory cortical reorganization produced by partial hearing loss","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Dexter Irvine","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143508","simplified_title":"Systems contributing to changes in the brain that occur as a consequence of severe hearing loss in adults","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"364768.36","source_system":"When part of the cochlea is damaged in adult animals, leading to a partial hearing loss, the auditory area of the cerebral cortex reorganizes itself, so that the area deprived of input by the peripheral lesion is not silent, but is occupied by expanded representations of adjacent frequencies.

If it does, it would have important consequences for the way in which input from a hearing aid or cochlear prosthesis (bionic ear) is processed in the brain. This Project is designed to clarify the nature of the systems in the brain that contribute to this form of cortical plasticity, using an animal model. One aim is to determine whether the plasticity is intrinsic to the cortex or occurs in the pathways over which information is conveyed to the cortex. This will be assessed by determining whether such plasticity is also found in the auditory thalamus, the final subcortical auditory nucleus from which information is sent to the cortex. The second aim is to determine whether the occurrence of plasticity is controlled by modulatory influences from the basal part of the forebrain. Neurons in this area project to many parts of the cortex, and evidence from other sensory systems suggests that these projections exert a permissive function, allowing the cortex to reorganize when input is altered. This aim will be pursued by determining whether cortical reorganization occurs after hearing loss when this basal forebrain system is inactivated. The significance of these studies is that they will elucidate the way in which the brain reorganizes itself when it is confronted with altered input.

The consequent nerve cell death leads to ongoing neurological impairment which represents a major cost to the individual and to the community. Neuroactive steroids are hormones related to the steroid hormone progesterone that have been shown to have a major influence on nerve cell activity and nervous transmission. While these hormones influence mood and behaviour in adult subjects, they have an even more important role in the fetus which is exposed to high levels of steroids from the placenta. The fetus is very sensitive to these neuroactive steroids and we have shown that they suppress the activity of the fetal brain so as to maintain the fetus in a sleep-like state during pregnancy. Periods of low oxygen supply (hypoxia) to the fetus may occur during pregnancy, as well as result from asphyxia at birth, and may lead to excessive excitation of nerve cells resulting in nerve cell death. Steroid-induced suppression reduces excitation of nerve cells and results in the fetus being resistant to excessive excitation. In this proposal we investigate the hypothesis that cells in the fetal brain modify the neuroactive steroid environment within the brain so as to suppress fetal brain activity further during times of hypoxic stress and, therefore, further protect the brain from damage caused by excessive excitation. These mechanisms may prevent brain injury due to placental insufficiency during pregnancy, asphyxia during birth and in premature babies. We will investigate whether the supplementation of these processes by administering neuroactive steroids may provide additional nerve protection during high-risk periods during pregnancy. These studies may identify a new as yet unexploited group of natural compounds which may improve infant health without adverse actions on the mother or baby."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Walker","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022785","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"5018162","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82870","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Jonathan Hirst","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0019636","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hirst","source_individual_id":"RMIS59251","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jonathan Hirst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82003","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2355","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Sex differences in the mechanisms by which stress inhibits the secretion and actions of GnRH","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["hypothalamus","neuroendocrinology","pituitary gland","sex differences","stress and reproduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143501,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["endocrinology","infertility","reproduction","stress"],"scientific_title":"Sex differences in the mechanisms by which stress inhibits the secretion and actions of GnRH","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Alan Tilbrook","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143501","simplified_title":"Sex, stress and reproduction","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"408055.08","source_system":"It is well known that stress can impair reproduction in humans and animals but it is not understood how this occurs. Consequently there are no therapies available to overcome the detrimental effects of stress on reproduction. Stress can take many forms, such as psychological stress, surgical trauma, strenuous exercise, undernutrition, all of which may inhibit reproduction. We now know that males and females respond differently to stress and we have shown that stress is also likely to have different effects on reproduction in males and females. In this project we aim to determine how stress impairs reproduction in males and females. A major effect of stress appears to be to inhibit the secretion of a substance produced by the brain that is necessary for the regulation of reproduction. This substance is called gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and it acts on a small gland at the base of the brain to cause the release of hormones that are essential for reproduction in both males and females. It is also possible that stress may inhibit the actions of GnRH. Our research suggests that there may be differences between males and females in the extent to which stress inhibits the secretion of GnRH from the brain and its actions to cause the release of other reproductive hormones. In this project we will determine how stress acts in the brain to affect the secretion and actions of GnRH in males and females. Our research will make a major contribution to our knowledge of the way that stress inhibits reproduction in males and females. This information is essential in order to develop specific remedies to overcome reproductive disorders caused by stress and to improve reproductive health in both sexes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Iain Clarke","data":{"first_name":"Iain","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024151","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Clarke","source_individual_id":"RMIS199493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Iain Clarke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83200","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Tilbrook","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005042","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Tilbrook","source_individual_id":"5017940","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alan Tilbrook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78072","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2354","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of regulation in preventing sports injuries","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["eye injury","health and safety regulation","health behaviours","injury prevention","sports injury"],"nhmrc_grant_id":136929,"application_year":2000,"start_year":2001,"scientific_title":"The role of regulation in preventing sports injuries","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Finch","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/136929","simplified_title":"The role of regulation in preventing sports injuries","sub_type":"Translational Grants In Injury","total_budget":"121906","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Caroline Finch","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036608","middle_name":"Frances","last_name":"Finch","source_individual_id":"RMIS222947","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Caroline Finch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86493","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Catherine Mccarty","data":{"first_name":"Catherine","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0020712","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mccarty","source_individual_id":"RMIS328929","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Catherine Mccarty"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82296","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr Paul Vear","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016822","middle_name":"","last_name":"Vear","source_individual_id":"RMIS881621","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr Paul Vear"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81273","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Neville Owen","data":{"first_name":"Neville","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003812","middle_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Owen","source_individual_id":"5016815","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Neville Owen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77725","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2158","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cerebral circulation in sleep - physiology & pathophysiology","data":{"media_summary":"Sleep, REM","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Apnea","Blood Flow","Brain","Heart","Sleep"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124567,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Brain Injuries","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Myocardial Infarction","Sleep Apnea Syndrome","Sleep, REM"],"scientific_title":"Cerebral circulation in sleep - physiology & pathophysiology","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Physiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Adrian Walker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124567","simplified_title":"Factors causing brain injury in sleep.","sub_type":"Standard Project with Research Fellowship","total_budget":"779650.67","source_system":"Prolonged, repetitive episodes of obstructed breathing during sleep (known as obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome or OSA) is a common medical problem that afflicts both adults and children.

Very recently, a new potential regulator of skeletal muscle glucose uptake has surfaced. Nitric oxide (NO), which has been shown to participate in blood flow, nerve transmission and immune function, appears to be a necessary component for muscle glucose uptake at rest and during exercise. We have shown that blocking muscle NO production substantially reduces leg glucose uptake during exercise. The aim of this project is to verify this finding and to determine the mechanisms underlying this result. One way we intend to do this is to see whether a drug (Viagra) which increases the effects of NO, raises muscle glucose uptake at rest and during exercise. In rats, a drug almost identical to Viagra stimulates muscle glucose uptake.

It is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children and the debilitating lung disease emphysema in adults. Antitrypsin is produced in the liver and secreted into the circulation. Its primary role is to inhibit the degradative enzyme elastase which attacks the tissues of the lung. A deficiency in Antitrypsin leads to uncontrolled elastase activity which destroys the lung tissue so causing emphysema. The deficiency is commonly caused by Antitrypsin being unable to enter the circulation. This is due to mutations within the Antitrypsin molecule which cause the protein to adopt an incorrect three-dimensional structure. This causes the protein to form long chains within the liver, which in turn damage the liver cell. There are no specific treatments for Antitrypsin deficiency, this partly reflects our lack of understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. This project examines the effects of the mutations upon the folding of Antitrypsin so that we can understand how these long protein chains form. Using a range of biochemical techniques we will monitor structural changes within the normal and abnormal proteins as they fold to determine how the mutations disrupt the process. These data will allow us to begin to rationally design inhibitors which will prevent the formation of the long chains, which we hope will aid in the treatment of patients with Antitrypsin deficiency.

It affects about 1% of individuals aged more than 50 years and approximately 50,000 Australians. Brain cells die over many years and eventually the loss is so bad from the parts of the brain that coordinate motor control that uncontrollable motor movements occur. The cause of the condition is unknown and although drugs can control the motor disorders for some 5 years, eventually increasing disability occurs and finally complete dependency. The condition has profound effects on the families of the sufferers and the Australian health care system. Clearly, it is most important to understand how brain cells die in this debilitating neurological condition because once this death mechanism is understood then strategies can be devised to protect at risk brain cells so that new drugs can be developed to prevent the onset and progression of the disease. Since post-mortem studies on human brain suggest that cells in Parkinson's disease die by a process of programmed cell death (i.e. an unknown stimulus gives the cells a message to die by an exact mechanism involving gene activation), we shall examine the involvement of this unique form of brain cell death and attempt to determine what factors initiate the process. By establishing experimental models where rat brain cells are cultured, we plan to test how multiple factors could start the death cascade and how possible treatments may be preventitive. These assessments will be performed by measuring cellular biochemistry and electrical activity. We also hope to examine how at risk brain cells can be rescued and stimulated to grow to re-establish normal brain circuits.

Productive (or technical) efficiency is a key aspect of health system reform - that given health services are produced with the minimum feasible amount of resources. Despite the importance of technical efficiency there have been few published studies in Australia which measure technical efficiency in the health sector. This study will develop theoretical and empirical approaches to measuring technical efficiency in the production of hospital services using data from Victoria. Measures of hospital technical efficiency will be developed using two quantitative modelling approaches: stochastic frontier modelling and data envelopment analysis. Results will be used to investigate the impact of patient and hospital characteristics on efficiency, and to identify economies of scale and scope in the provision of hospital services. The robustness of results to changes in variables, the sample of hospitals studied, and model assumptions will be tested, and two techniques will be compared to assess their appropriateness in the health services context which has not previously been done. Criteria for assessing the approaches include the degree to which: assumptions affect the robustness of results; the techniques capture the salient features of health services production; and the techniques produce similar rankings and estimates of inefficiency. The methods used will represent a significant contribution to international knowledge of hospital efficiency measurement, and the relationships between hospital characteristics, casemix, and efficiency. The study wil provide improved measures of hospital efficiency in Victoria, and will inform debate on hospital funding policy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Stuart Peacock","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0021386","middle_name":"","last_name":"Peacock","source_individual_id":"RMIS78936","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Stuart Peacock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82492","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2121","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effect of pregnancy and pre-eclampsia on smooth muscle and endothelial cell function in arteries isolated from women","data":{"media_summary":"vascular endothelial cell dysfunction","end_year":2002,"keywords":["electrophysiology","endothelium","hyperpolarizing factor, nitric oxide, prostacyclin","patch clamp","vascular smooth muscle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124470,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","hypertension","maternal & fetal health","pre-eclampsia","vascular endothelial cell dysfunction"],"scientific_title":"Effect of pregnancy and pre-eclampsia on smooth muscle and endothelial cell function in arteries isolated from women","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Helena Parkington","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124470","simplified_title":"Mechanisms controlling the calibre of arteries during pregnancy and pre-eclampsia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"194537.23","source_system":"During normal pregnancy the blood vessels of the mother become relaxed. This helps to meet the growing demands of the mother at this time and also ensures sufficient blood supply to the developing fetus. Blood vessels are lined by a single cell layer called the endothelium. The endothelium inactivates a variety of circulating agents which cause arteries to contract, and it also produces potent substances that directly relax the muscle cells in the blood vessel wall. Thus the endothelium plays an important role in the adaptation of the maternal blood vessels to pregnancy. Insufficient blood supply to the placenta somehow triggers myriad processes including endothelial dysfunction, enhanced clotting of the blood and contraction of the maternal blood vessels, which culminates in the serious disorder of pregnancy known as pre-eclampsia. This condition threatens the health of both mother and fetus, and in Australia, is responsible for 15% of direct maternal deaths and 10% of perinatal mortality. The focus of this project is to study the function of the endothelium and the muscle in the artery wall, and how the function of these entities is altered in the natural adaptation to pregnancy and in pre-eclampsia. The general aim of this study is two fold: (1) to determine how endothelial function adapts to pregnancy and how this is compromised in pre-eclampsia (2) to determine how factors released from the endothelium alone, or in combination with changes in inherent muscle function, alter the state of relaxation and contraction of muscle in the blood vessel wall, and the influence of pregnancy and of pre-eclampsia on these. This project will contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms that control the relaxation and contraction of blood vessels in normal pregnancy and those mechanisms that are impaired during pre-eclampsia and thus, may facilitate the development of treatments for this serious disorder."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helena Parkington","data":{"first_name":"Helena","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044715","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Parkington","source_individual_id":"5016864","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Helena Parkington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88566","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2120","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An analysis of a model of movement disorder lacking D1R positive neurons.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Basal ganglia","Cre mediated recombination","gene targeting"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124467,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Extrapyramidal disease","Huntington's disease","Parkinsonism"],"scientific_title":"An analysis of a model of movement disorder lacking D1R positive neurons.","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr JOHN DRAGO","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124467","simplified_title":"A genetically engineered mouse model of human movement dosorder.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"346446.74","source_system":"The experiments outlined in this project proposal are aimed at further characterizing a genetically engineered mouse the generation of which was originally funded by the Australian NH and MRC.

These virulence determinants are either directly involved in allowing infection to take place, or cause the damage that we recognize as an infectious disease. Some virulence determinants are produced all the time, while others are only made in particular conditions - their expression is regulated. To target efforts in the development of new vaccines and treatments, it is important to identify all the virulence determinants produced by a particular bacterial species, but also to know which are regulated, and the environmental signals that determine their expression. It can be just as important to know whether a virulence determinant is constantly expressed, and therefore represents an invariant target. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are two important disease-causing bacteria that exclusively infect humans and cause gonorrhoea, and meningitis. The complete DNA sequence of both of these bacteria is currently being determined. From computer analysis of these data, it appears that these bacteria have few of the specific regulatory systems that are present in other bacteria. The availability of DNA sequencing data enables an alternative and much more systematic approach to the identification and study of the regulation of virulence determinants. Because of the limited repertoire of regulatory systems still present in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, it is feasible to mutate each and determine which are involved in regulation of virulence determinants. We will also be able to identify genes regulated by each system, determine how regulation is achieved, and use this information to identify any presently unknown virulence genes controlled by the same system. Such an analysis has never been previously achieved for any bacterial species, because of the number and complexity of the regulatory systems usually present."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Davies","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018567","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Davies","source_individual_id":"RMIS63182","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Davies"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81757","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2118","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Relationship between nigral injury, dopamine handling and dyskinesia in Parkinsonism","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2000,"keywords":["Axonal Sprouting","Dopamine","Dyskinesia","Movement Disorders","Regeneration"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124463,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Health related to ageing","Nervous system and disorders","Parkinson's disease","Substance abuse"],"scientific_title":"Relationship between nigral injury, dopamine handling and dyskinesia in Parkinsonism","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Malcolm Horne","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124463","simplified_title":"The mechanisms of Dyskinesia","sub_type":"Bridging","total_budget":"65685.6","source_system":"Parkinson's Disease is a disabling condition that results from loss of nerve cells (neurones) in the part of the brain known as the substantia nigra (SN).

Unfortunately this benefit is not sustained and is frequently marred by the production of unpleasant writhing wriggling movements called dyskinesia. These movements can also complicate the treatment for schizophrenia and other neurological conditions. The way the brain compensates for loss of SN neurones and why dyskinesia occur is unknown. However we present a hypothesis that the mechanisms for compensation also produce the dyskinesia. We have shown that an injury to the SN results in a compensatory response of vigorous sprouting of the surviving dopamine neurones. This sprouting may also explain why dyskinesias occur.

This in tern may cause behavioural and mood changes in adults, leading to conditions such as premenstrual stress and postnatal depression. In fetal life, the placenta releases large amounts of these neuroactive steroids and high concentrations of these steroid are found in the fetal circulation. We have shown that these steroids suppress the activity of the fetal brain, suppress arousal and maintain the fetus in a sleep-like state during pregnancy. In this proposal we investigate the hypothesis that cells in the fetal brain modify the neuroactive steroid environment within the brain so as to suppress fetal brain activity further during times of stress and, therefore, protect the brain from damage caused by excessive excitation. These mechanisms may prevent brain injury due to placental insufficiency during pregnancy and asphyxia during birth. The augmentation of these natural processes may form the bases for treatment strategies to provide additional protection for the fetal brain in high-risk pregnancies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Jonathan Hirst","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0019636","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hirst","source_individual_id":"RMIS59251","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jonathan Hirst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82003","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2116","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Risk factors for asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema in older adults","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Environmental tobacco smoke","Indoor air quality","Nutritional epidemiology","Occupational exposure assessment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124431,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Asthma","Chronic Bronchitis","Emphysema"],"scientific_title":"Risk factors for asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema in older adults","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Abramson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124431","simplified_title":"Causes of chronic obstructive lung diseases in older adults","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"330574.59","source_system":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a major public health problem in Australia.

The proposed study will focus on occupational and domestic exposures and dietary factors in older people. Dusty jobs have long been associated with COPD. However it is not known to what extent other occupational exposures to fumes and vapours are also responsible. Identifying such jobs would lead to better workplace conditions and prevention of further cases. Workers who have already developed COPD could be more fairly compensated. Similarly if indoor exposures to tobacco smoke and unvented gas appliances were found to play a role, further controls on smoking, flues and improved ventilation could also prevent cases of COPD. It is generally thought that emphysema develops from an imbalance between the oxidative stresses on the lungs and protective enzymes. A diet high in antioxidant vitamins and fish may protect against the development of COPD. If confirmed by this study, it would then be possible to conduct clinical trials of supplementation in smokers at risk of developing COPD.

Changes in behaviour such as increasing physical activity and eating less high-calorie food help many people reduce their body weight, however many others have a genetic predisposition to become overweight and behavioural measures are ineffective. Although anti-obesity drugs should be a valuable adjunct to lifestyle changes, the currently available appetite suppressants are not ideal. Our work involves studying particular cell-surface proteins (receptors) which normally respond to hormones such as adrenaline. The beta(3)-adrenergic receptor is known to mediate the breakdown of fats and increased heat production in adipose tissue and possibly muscle. Administration of beta(3)-selective drugs to obese mice promotes weight loss and a reduction of diabetic symptoms, and a number of drugs targetting the human beta(3)-adrenergic receptor are being developed by pharmaceutical companies. We are trying to understand more about the properties of this receptor, as this information will assist in designing drugs which are more selective and more potent. Sometimes drugs act at more than one receptor, and there is evidence that this may be the case for two drugs called CGP 12177 and BRL 37344 which stimulate the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor. The second major aim of our project is to find out whether these drugs act at a novel receptor which is related to the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor and also mediates energy expenditure and heat production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The discovery of a new receptor would provide additional scope for the development of effective anti-obesity treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roger Summers","data":{"first_name":"Roger","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016511","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Summers","source_individual_id":"5017774","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Roger Summers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81186","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2106","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Differentiation of respiratory behaviour in the mammalian fetus","data":{"media_summary":"respiratory instability in the newborn","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Anatomy- Histology, Histochemistry, Ultrastructure","Brainstem control of spinal cord","Development of spinal motor patterns","Developmental neurobiology","ontogeny of behaviour"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124405,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Development of breathing","Spinal cord injury","Spinal motor rhythm","immature respiratory patterns","respiratory instability in the newborn"],"scientific_title":"Differentiation of respiratory behaviour in the mammalian fetus","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Philip Berger","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124405","simplified_title":"Development of the ability to breathe","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"434839.74","source_system":"Mammalian fetuses are highly active from early in gestation, manifesting patterns of activity that are gradually transformed throughout fetal life, ultimately producing a repertoire of behaviours essential for postnatal survival.

We plan to examine neural control mechanisms that transform a primitive pattern of breathing in the early gestation fetus into the functional form that effectively ventilates the lungs after birth. In addition to examining the prenatal development of breathing, our program will focus on the developmental fate of a transient behaviour restricted to early development. This early behaviour plays a fundamental role in the development of the motor system before being extinguished under the influence of supraspinal inputs.

Moreover, the use of crude extracts in diagnosis of allergy among some atopic individuals may be inaccurate or ineffective. In the last eight years of my research, I have contributed significantly to the identification, characterisation and molecular cloning of grass pollen allergens. In this proposal, I aim to evaluate recombinant rye grass pollen allergens as standardised and more effective diagnostic reagents and, through the identification and better understanding of the allergenic segments of these proteins, to prepare recombinant mutants of the same proteins which are no londer allergenic. Avaliability of such non-allergenic protein reagents will provide safer immunotherapy in the future.

Determination of biological function and structure of such allergens will allow their importance for the pollen-plant to be determined and, since function may be relevant to sensitisation of suceptible individuals to these allergens, these findings will stimulate the development of novel concepts in allergen prevention and therapy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Cenk Suphioglu","data":{"first_name":"Cenk","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010509","middle_name":"","last_name":"Suphioglu","source_individual_id":"RMIS5633","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Cenk Suphioglu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79555","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2103","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cellular mechanisms of pacemaking in the upper urinary tract: effects of sensory neuropeptides and prostaglandins","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2000,"keywords":["Gastrointestinal and urinary tract peristalsis","Intracellular microelectrode and patch clamp methods","Pacemakers in smooth muscle","Prostaglandin and neuropeptide modulation of ion channels","Sensory nerve transmitter mechanisms"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124356,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Renal colic","Stasis and urinary tract infection","Ureteric obstruction","Urinary Calculi"],"scientific_title":"Cellular mechanisms of pacemaking in the upper urinary tract: effects of sensory neuropeptides and prostaglandins","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Richard Lang","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124356","simplified_title":"Effects of endogenously released agents on the function of the mammalian upper urinary tract","sub_type":"Bridging","total_budget":"80680.55","source_system":"The mammalian upper urinary tract (UUT) serves to propel urine from the renal pelvis within the kidney through the ureter to the bladder, where it is stored until micturition. This propulsion of urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder occurs by the means of spontaneous peristaltic contractions in the smooth muscle wall of the UUT, intimately dependent on the localized release of prostaglandins. Approximately 10% of the population suffer from renal calculi (kidney stones) at some stage of their lifetime, with men being 2-4 times more likely than women to have calculi. Pain management of renal colic usually involves the prescribing of strong analgesics, and antispasmodic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Most stones are expelled spontaneously if they are small. Larger stones require interventions such as fragmentation (extracorpereal lithotripsy), which is an out patient procedure, or physical removal, using ureterscopes or endoscopes or open surgery under general anesthesia; procedures usually requiring hospital stays of 2-7 days. This project will provide valuable information on the mechanisms by which sensory nerves and endogenous prostaglandins control motility in the mammalian UUT. In particular, these studies will contribute to the search of specific anti-inflammatory agents which will affect particular aspects of UUT motility. A clearer understanding of the cellular origin of UUT rhythmicity will lead to more informed non-surgical interventions to encourage the passing of painful calculi. Such information will also aid in the treatments of other forms of renal colic, during ureteric obstruction, and urinary tract infection.

These gonadotrophins act on the testes to ensure the production of sperm and other hormones, including testosterone. We plan to determine how testosterone acts on the brain to control GnRH secretion. To do this we will use male sheep and conduct a series of experiments designed to show where in the brain testosterone acts to ultimately affect the nerve cells that produce GnRH.

In this project we propose that hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions in the womb, either alone or in combination with substances released because of maternal infection, cause accumulation of a neurotoxic substance - QUINOLINIC ACID - in the fetal brain and circulation. The increased production of QUINOLINIC ACID occurs because certain cells react to the low oxygen and infectious conditions - these cells include MICROGLIA, a cell type in the brain. Little is currently known about MICROGLIA in the developing brain. We will therefore study the effects of hypoxia and infection in fetal sheep, and we will determine how these conditions affect MICROGLIA and the synthesis of QUINOLINIC ACID in the fetal brain. The capacity of the brain to produce QUINOLINIC ACID is closely related to the dietary intake of the essential amino acid TRYPTOPHAN, and it is decreased when synthetic analogues of tryptophan are infused. Therefore, we have devised a treatment regime using these tryptophan analogues to prevent increases of QUINOLINIC ACID concnetrations in the fetal brain, and we propose that a simple treament is at hand to reduce the incidence of perinatal brain damage in human pregnancies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Walker","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022785","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"5018162","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82870","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2099","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"ISG60, a novel interferon-induced protein: cell growth inhibitory actions","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["anaphase promoting complex","cell growth cycle and cell division","cytoskeletal components","interferon","retinoblastoma protein"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124341,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Immunity","Viral infectious disease"],"scientific_title":"ISG60, a novel interferon-induced protein: cell growth inhibitory actions","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Chemical messengers known as cytokines direct the way T cells behave. One of these cytokines, known as interleukin-18, has been shown to stimulate T cells and other immune cells to induce inflammation that is helpful when the body is fighting infection but is harmful in immune diseases. This project will determine the role of interleukin-18 in glomerulonephritis by studying the way it talks to T cells and the mechanisms by which it incites inflammation in the kidney. Mice with glomerulonephritis will be treated by blocking the actions of interleukin-18 to discover whether interleukin-18 produced by the animal is important in kidney damage induced by glomerulonephritis, to understand the way in which this cytokine works and to assess whether blocking interleukin-18 could be a useful treatment for glomerulonephritis in humans.

Hypertonic saline (HTS) is an intravenous salt solution which has been used in intensive care patients for many years to decrease brain swelling in head injured patients. We know that HTS can be given to patients before they reach hospital, is safe, and acts by rapidly increasing blood pressure and decreasing brain swelling. Accordingly HTS may minimise secondary brain injury and lead to increased survival. Importantly, HTS is likely to dramatically improve neurological function of survivors without any significant risk of side effects.

Nut allergy usually presents in infancy and persists indefinitely. As nuts are used in a wider and less visible range of food products, sensitisation is increasing and occurring earlier. It has been proposed, wrongly, that peanut (groundnut) allergic patients do not suffer from allergy to tree nuts (hazel, almond, Brazil, walnut). However a British survey of 1250 patients suffering from peanut anaphylaxis revealed that 50% of people with peanut allergy are also allergic to other nuts confirming our own clinical observations. At present, unlike insect venom allergy, grass pollen allergy and house dust mite allergy, there is no preventative treatment available. We plan to explore peanut allergy and investigate cross-reactivity between peanuts and major tree nuts to attempt to identify an allergen(s) that could explain the molecular nature of the allergy and offer approaches to immunotherapy.

This affects our abilities at many ordinary tasks, such as keeping up a conversation in a noisy background, and also in other critical tasks (eg., in following warning signals in a noisy factory environment). In people who have some hearing loss, even if only partial deafness, localization ability is disrupted even when there is no noise in the background, and is even more severely disrupted when the environment is noisy. SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Our localization ability depends on the way neurons in the brain code the position of a source of sound we wish to detect. From studies in animals we know a lot about the way in which neurons do this coding in silence. However, we know almost nothing about how this coding is affected by a noisy background. Further, we know absolutely nothing about how this coding, whether in silence or when there is noise, is affected when there is also a hearing loss. SIGNIFICANCE : If we are to understand the effects of hearing losses on coding of the location of a sound signal we need to know first how noise affects the coding in cases of normal hearing. This project aims to gain that information. I will then extend this to studying the detailed basis of these effects, ie., exactly what mechanisms are affected in the neurons. Then I will determine how noise from different positions affects the coding of signal sounds at differnt positions. These data will provide us the essential base from which we can, later, go on to study how noise affects coding by neurons of the location of a signal. I plan to increase the value of the current study by developing, from the data gained in the studies in animals, computer-based models that will allow us to predict how coding of sound signal location is affected by hearing loss, and how this is exacerbated by noisy environments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ramesh Rajan","data":{"first_name":"Ramesh","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027485","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rajan","source_individual_id":"5017097","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Ramesh Rajan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84094","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2091","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator gene expression in endothelial cells and in transgenic mice","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["gene regulation","tissue-type plasminogen activator","transgenic mice","tumour necrosis factor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124316,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["blood disorders","fibrinolysis","thrombosis"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of tissue-type plasminogen activator gene expression in endothelial cells and in transgenic mice","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Robert Medcalf","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124316","simplified_title":"Understanding how a gene involved in removing blood clots is regulated in human cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"244009.28","source_system":"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is an enzyme which plays an important role in the removal of blood clots from the circulation.

We are investigating the processes that naturally regulate these receptors and therefore modulate the adhesive properties of platelets. We have found that a group of enzymes, also located on the platelet surface, remove these receptors, thereby limiting the ability of these cells to stick to blood vessels and form clots.

However, the system is not prefect and sometimes attacks an individual's own tissue (termed autoimmunity). Autoimmunity is not uncommon in the population, including diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and pernicious anaemia, to name a few. To study the details associated with why and how the immune system can turn on the host, we use animal models which mimic the human diseases. The model we use is a mouse model for autoimmune gastritis which is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder of the stomach. People with autoimmune gastritis produce a specific autoimmune response directed at the acid secreting cells of the stomach call parietal cells. Parietal cells also produced a substance called intrinsic factor which is needed for the absorption of vitamin B12 from the diet. The lack of vitamin B12 uptake results in abnormal red blood cell formation and anaemia; hence the term pernicious anaemia. One of the unanswered questions associated with the immune system is what regulates the whole system so that it does not induce autoimmunity in everyone. The mechanisms which control or prevent autoimmunity is the subject of much debate. There is good evidence that regulation of the immune system is performed by specific suppression by regulatory cells. Many important question about these cells remain unanswered. For example, it is not known how these cells are generated or how they prevent the autoreactive cells from performing their harmful behaviour. Using our animal model for autoimmune gastritis, we are addressing some of the questions which surround the events which induce and protect us from autoimmunity. By using mice in which most of the lymphocytes in the circulation are of the same specificity (TCR-transgenic), we can follow the fate of those cells and look for cells with different characteristics; such as the ability to supress an immune response."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ban-Hock Toh","data":{"first_name":"Ban-Hock","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010681","middle_name":"","last_name":"Toh","source_individual_id":"5017936","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ban-Hock Toh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79599","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2084","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Early intervention for anxiety and phobic disorders in young children with intellectual disability","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["behaviour therapy","early intervention","parent skills training","randomized-controlled trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124305,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["childhood anxiety","mental retardation","panic disorders","phobic disorders and fears"],"scientific_title":"Early intervention for anxiety and phobic disorders in young children with intellectual disability","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Neville King","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124305","simplified_title":"Preventing anxiety and fear in young children with intellectual disability","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"305674.57","source_system":"Children with intellectual disability (ID) are 2-3 times more likely to have behavioural and emotional disturbance, including anxiety and fears, than children of normal intellectual ability.

Research with non-disabled children has demonstrated the effectiveness of teaching parents to manage their child's anxiety, however the effectiveness of this approach in children with ID has not yet been established. This project aims to compare the relative effectiveness of two intervention conditions compared to a waiting list group, for highly anxious children aged 4-7 years with ID.

The other intervention will provide non-directive counselling and support to help the parents understand the nature and causes of ID, associated anxiety problems in the child, and parent and family stress. The long term outcome of these two interventions will be assessed by following the children and their families for two years. A manual of each treatment is produced. This project aims to provide evidence for a relatively inexpensive, feasible and effective early intervention program for young children with ID at risk for developing anxiety problems that can be easily taught to professionals and is acceptable to parents.

Parents of children with autism are under significant amounts of stress; reporting high levels of disturbed family functioning and mental health problems.

The correct balance between the contracting chemicals and the relaxing chemicals is essential for normal healthy functioning of the vessels and therefore proper blood flow through the organs of the body, and for the maintenance of normal blood pressure. If an imbalance occurs, such as a decrease in the effectiveness of the relaxing chemicals, then the muscle in the wall of the blood vessels tends to be more contracted, and this may result in decreased blood flow and possibly increased blood pressure. Such imbalances may underlie the vascular complications of diabetes, Raynaud's Phenomenon and essential hypertension. In a recent study on the effects of relaxing chemicals released from the endothelial cells, we have discovered the effects of a chemical which can cause blood vessels to contract. The chemical identity of this factor and the mechanisms by which it causes contraction are not known. Since excess activity of this chemical would tend to contract the blood vessels and therefore raise blood pressure, it is important to determine the chemical identity of this substance, and to determine how it causes contraction. The eventual development of drugs to inhibit the actions of this chemical may be a possible means for treating some diseases of the vascular system. This study is aimed at determining how this factor causes the blood vessels to contract, and takes the first steps towards determining its identity."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Harold Coleman","data":{"first_name":"Harold","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024194","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Coleman","source_individual_id":"RMIS55381","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Harold Coleman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83213","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2081","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular investigations of antithrombin instability and heparin binding mechanism","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["antithrombin","heparin","latency","polymerization","thrombosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":124301,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","regulation of coagulation/ blood clotting","thrombosis"],"scientific_title":"Molecular investigations of antithrombin instability and heparin binding mechanism","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Robert Pike","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124301","simplified_title":"Strategies towards designing a stable, activated antithrombin","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"195691.7","source_system":"Thrombosis is a significant disease affecting a large number of people. The primary treatment for episodes of acute thrombosis is administration of the anticoagulant, heparin. The effector molecule through which heparin carries out its action is the serine proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin. This molecule regulates blood clotting by inhibiting the proteinases which carry out this process. Antithrombin is converted from a poor inhibitor of coagulation proteases to a very good inhibitor on binding heparin. This provides a control point for coagulation. The mechanism by which antithrombin is converted to a very good inhibitor of coagulation proteases involves a large change in the structure of this protein. These changes in structure are linked to the changes which occur when antithrombin becomes inactive through the process of polymerisation. Certain patients with thrombosis have been found to have changes in both the stability and heparin affinity of their antithrombin molecules, which forms the underlying basis for the disease. We wish to study the reasons for the effects of mutations in the antithrombin variants by making recombinant mutants which mimic the molecules in the thrombotic patients and carrying out detailed, sophisticated molecular analyses of their interaction with heparin and proteases and their stability under various conditions. Additionally we will engineer recombinant mutants of antithrombin which we believe will stabilise the molecule and potentially act as an improved supplement for therapy. This analysis will provide important insights into the functioning of both heparin and antithrombin and thereby significantly improve our understanding of the control of coagulation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Pike","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015599","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Pike","source_individual_id":"RMIS39559","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Pike"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80935","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2080","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["HIV-1","cytoplasmic retention factors","importins","nuclear protein import","nuclear targeting signals"],"nhmrc_grant_id":122821,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Anti-viral therapy","HIV-1/AIDS","RNA viruses"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Jans","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/122821","simplified_title":"Transport of viral proteins to the nucleus","sub_type":"ANCARD Project Grant","total_budget":"210199.69","source_system":"Approaches to combat AIDS and its causative agent, the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1, have thus far proved ineffective.

We will apply our expertise in the area of the regulation of nuclear import of viral proteins, and build on our observations with respect to these proteins to attempt to establish the mechanistic basis of their nuclear import, and how this differs from the conventional nuclear import pathways used by normal cellular proteins. We already have evidence that nuclear import of HIV-Tat is regulated in novel fashion by cellular factors, and intend, through determining its mechanistic basis, to be able to form the basis of a strategy to block this import pathway specifically, and thereby inhibit HIV replication.

We will use human prostate cells grown in artificial conditions to determine which hormones alter the types of cells and especially examine those cells which can contract as these may be of critical importance in the urethral obstruction.
