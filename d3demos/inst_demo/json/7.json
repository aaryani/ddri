The results will help Australia respond better to this devastating health problem."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alison Ritter","data":{"first_name":"Alison","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039345","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ritter","source_individual_id":"RMIS3485","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alison Ritter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87200","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Farrell","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030628","middle_name":"Proinsias","last_name":"Farrell","source_individual_id":"5032066","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Farrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84958","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Marian Shanahan","data":{"first_name":"Marian","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027893","middle_name":"Doris","last_name":"Shanahan","source_individual_id":"5017452","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Marian Shanahan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84197","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Pascal Perez","data":{"first_name":"Pascal","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027302","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perez","source_individual_id":"5016935","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Pascal Perez"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84054","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Nagesh Shukla","data":{"first_name":"Nagesh","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010251","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shukla","source_individual_id":"5043427","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Nagesh Shukla"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79481","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/73841","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Phenomenology and Treatment of Emotion Dysregulation in Traumatized Refugees","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["refugee health","posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)","mental illness","psychological treatment","traumatic stress"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1042882,"application_year":2012,"health_keywords":["treatment strategies"],"scientific_title":"The Phenomenology and Treatment of Emotion Dysregulation in Traumatized Refugees","start_year":2013,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Angela Nickerson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1042882","simplified_title":"Emotion Regulation in Traumatized Refugees","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"241074.75","source_system":"Refugee mental health is a crucial public health concern in Australia.

This project will enable understanding of the fate of Tfh in HIV infection and its role in HIV host defense and it may facilitate the design of vaccine against HIV."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Yin Xu","data":{"first_name":"Yin","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0005568","middle_name":"","last_name":"Xu","source_individual_id":"5041580","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Ms Yin Xu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78214","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/73450","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"IStoppFalls: ICT based system to predict &amp; prevent falls","data":{"media_summary":"evaluation","end_year":2014,"keywords":["accidental falls","exercise training","falls prevention","prediction","monitoring"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1038210,"application_year":2011,"health_keywords":["ageing population","healthy ageing","health care delivery","development","evaluation"],"scientific_title":"IStoppFalls: ICT based system to predict &amp; prevent falls","start_year":2012,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Kim Delbaere","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1038210","simplified_title":"Development and evaluation of innovative home-based technologies for continuous monitoring and prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults","sub_type":"Aust/EU Collaborative Research Grant","total_budget":"579018.27","source_system":"Technology-based solutions have potential to increase effectiveness of individualized quality healthcare while reducing costs and using scarce human resources to maximum effect.

We will use this method to identify which lipids contribute the most to T cell deregulation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Katharina Gaus","data":{"first_name":"Katharina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036795","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gaus","source_individual_id":"5014795","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Katharina Gaus"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86529","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jeremie Rossy","data":{"first_name":"Jeremie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009979","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rossy","source_individual_id":"5046101","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Jeremie Rossy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79409","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/72483","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2016,"keywords":["substance use","policy analysis","addiction","public health policy","health services research"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1021988,"application_year":2011,"start_year":2012,"scientific_title":"Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Alison Ritter","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1021988","simplified_title":"Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"605427.26","source_system":"I lead an internationally recognised research program that examines how governments can best respond to alcohol and illegal drugs _ a significant health and social problem in Australia.

Our aim is to establish this concept in laboratory based experiments as a basis for selection of patients who are more likely to benefit from GSAO treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Hendrik-Tobias Arkenau","data":{"first_name":"Hendrik-Tobias","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011497","middle_name":"","last_name":"Arkenau","source_individual_id":"5018612","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Hendrik-Tobias Arkenau"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79822","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Pierre Dilda","data":{"first_name":"Pierre","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006970","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Dilda","source_individual_id":"5018778","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Pierre Dilda"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78591","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65508","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Evaluating the safety of computer decision support systems in general practice","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["computer-based decision support","evaluation studies","general practice","safety"],"nhmrc_grant_id":630583,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["decison-making","information science- medical informatics","information systems-decison support systems - clinical","quality assurance-evaluation of safety and adverse events"],"scientific_title":"Evaluating the safety of computer decision support systems in general practice","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health Information Systems (incl.

I will use mathematical and statistical approaches to analyse and model this data to better understand immune recognition."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Diako Ebrahimi Mohammadi","data":{"first_name":"Diako","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042200","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ebrahimi Mohammadi","source_individual_id":"5014464","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Diako Ebrahimi Mohammadi"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87943","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/64288","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Muscle contracture in multiple sclerosis Prevalence and rehabilitation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["clinical trial","muscle mechanics","muscle stiffness","muscle tendon"],"nhmrc_grant_id":568953,"application_year":2008,"start_year":2009,"scientific_title":"Muscle contracture in multiple sclerosis Prevalence and rehabilitation","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Phu Hoang","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/568953","simplified_title":"Muscle contracture in people with multiple sclerosis","sub_type":"Health Professional Research ECF","total_budget":"175583.48","source_system":"A population-based study of prevalence of muscle contracture will provide helpful information to health providers about the magnitude of the problem of contracture.

Our proposed study will help undertand the mechnisams of obesity."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Brown","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006259","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"5018346","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78405","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Hongyuan Yang","data":{"first_name":"Hongyuan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005579","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yang","source_individual_id":"5018531","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Hongyuan Yang"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78218","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/64242","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of a novel intervention for training stepping ability to reduce the risk of falls in older adults.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["accident prevention","balance","exercise training","falls","stepping"],"nhmrc_grant_id":568724,"application_year":2008,"health_keywords":["Aging","Falls and Injury","Muscular strength degeneratin with aging","Sensory Impairment"],"scientific_title":"Development of a novel intervention for training stepping ability to reduce the risk of falls in older adults.","start_year":2009,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Preventive Medicine","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Stephen Lord","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/568724","simplified_title":"Development of a novel intervention for training stepping ability to reduce the risk of falls in older adults.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"390393.74","source_system":"Stepping is often the last protective option to prevent a fall.

The Australian Burden of Disease project quantifies the relative burden associated with each disease. New estimates are to be released this year will outline the magnitude of burden associated with dementia now and estimate that for the year 2023. Although the projections use the best data available, three improvements to the methodology would improve the accuracy of the dementia burden estimates. First, the dementia calculations currently use a ï¿½disability weightï¿½ metric derived from a Dutch study. This is problematic in that the weights do not reflect an Australian experience of dementia, nor do they reflect the preferences of people closely affected by the disease (e.g. carers). Second, the dementia estimates do not include cases of mild cognitive impairment (considered a precursor state of dementia). Hence the dementia estimates may not estimate the full impact of dementia in Australia. Finally, there is no evidence that the method used by the Burden of Disease study to account for the impact of disease comorbidity adequately deals with the comorbidity associated with dementia. Consequently, there is need to develop a new and comprehensive set of disability weights for dementia that are Australian-based, include all stages of dementia severity and account for comorbidity. The proposed project aims to develop a new set of empirically derived Australian-based disability weights for dementia. The project will entail three studies. The first study will generate empirically based case vignettes that describe a range of dementia case scenarios. These descriptions will then be used in rating exercises (Study 2) to develop new disability weights. The second study involves Australian health practitioners, carers and lay persons reading case vignettes and completing health valuation rating exercises to generate new disability weights for dementia. The third study uses the new disability weights to re-calculate the burden of disease estimates for dementia. The new estimates will be compared to those reported by the 2007 Australian Burden of Disease project. In knowing the accuracy of the estimates, policy makers can use the burden data for dementia with confidence when engaging in service planning for the future."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Tracy Anderson","data":{"first_name":"Tracy","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040816","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Anderson","source_individual_id":"5013219","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Tracy Anderson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87586","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gavin Andrews","data":{"first_name":"Gavin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005813","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Andrews","source_individual_id":"5013220","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gavin Andrews"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78288","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62897","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Organic brain damage after non-fatal opioid overdose","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Brain injury","Neurocognitive assessment","Opioid dependence"],"nhmrc_grant_id":510314,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Acquired brain injury","Neuropsychological impairments","Opioid dependence"],"scientific_title":"Organic brain damage after non-fatal opioid overdose","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Shane Darke","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/510314","simplified_title":"Brain damage after heroin overdose","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"244858.23","source_system":"The study will provide the first data on the level and nature of brain damage due to opioid overdose.

This should expand our knowledge about CD and may lead to further ways to prevent or manage CD."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Steven Leach","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032002","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Leach","source_individual_id":"5015895","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Steven Leach"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85278","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Li Zhang","data":{"first_name":"Li","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029044","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zhang","source_individual_id":"5018593","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Li Zhang"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84533","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Hazel Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Hazel","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009157","middle_name":"Marjory","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"RMIS118549","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Hazel Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79187","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Andrew Day","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0001204","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Day","source_individual_id":"5030764","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Andrew Day"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76994","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62876","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Membrane order at T cell activation sites","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Lipid rafts","Lipids","Membrane structure","Signal transduction","T lymphocytes"],"nhmrc_grant_id":510225,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Cell signalling","Hyperlipidemia","Molecular basis of disease","Regulation of immune responses"],"scientific_title":"Membrane order at T cell activation sites","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Membrane Biology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Katharina Gaus","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/510225","simplified_title":"Membrane order in T cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"519715.21","source_system":"The activation of T lymphocytes is essential part of our immune system to fend off harmful intruders.

The influence metabolic factors and inflammation have on function of the ageing brain is likely to be determined by complex interplay between many factors, such as physical health, lifestyle, nutrition and our genes. By studying these factors and how they relate to one another in large groups of elderly individuals, we will be able to determine the role these factors play in brain ageing. In addition we will be able to determine an ï¿½at riskï¿½ profile for elderly individuals for accelerated ageing effects. Identification of this profile is important as it will allow the development of interventions which may prevent or delay the onset of cognitive decline in late life. We plan to study the impact of metabolic and inflammatory factors on brain ageing and in two groups of elderly individuals both of which are currently being studied in detail by our research team. By using these existing groups we will minimize the costs associated with our research, but maximize the research benefit and the benefit to society. Our groups include a large community sample of elderly individuals aged 70-90 years and a large group of elderly twins aged over 65 years. Our use of twins for the study is particularly important as it will help us separate genetic and environmental influences on the measures. We will measure multiple metabolic and inflammatory factors in the body and determine their relationship to detailed tests of cognitive function and to cerebrovascular pathology on brain magnetic resonance imaging. We will look at how these factors relate to one another and which factors are most strongly associated with accelerated ageing. We will be able to follow subjects in each group over a 2 year interval to see which factors most strongly predict change in cognitive function and cerebrovascular pathology over time. Our research is unique in its inclusion of multiple factors which may affect brain ageing, its ability to look in detail at the contribution of genetic influences on metabolic and inflammatory factors, and in our planned follow-up of these individuals."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Henry Brodaty","data":{"first_name":"Henry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035553","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brodaty","source_individual_id":"5012210","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Henry Brodaty"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86208","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bernhard Baune","data":{"first_name":"Bernhard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035297","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Baune","source_individual_id":"5013394","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Bernhard Baune"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86148","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Margaret Wright","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017233","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Wright","source_individual_id":"5018493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Margaret Wright"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81386","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Julian Trollor","data":{"first_name":"Julian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016713","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Trollor","source_individual_id":"5017992","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Julian Trollor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81241","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicholas Martin","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014736","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS2356999","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicholas Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80688","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Wei Wen","data":{"first_name":"Wei","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011005","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wen","source_individual_id":"5019375","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Wei Wen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79697","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Katherine Samaras","data":{"first_name":"Katherine","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010059","middle_name":"","last_name":"Samaras","source_individual_id":"RMIS620677","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Katherine Samaras"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79429","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lesley Campbell","data":{"first_name":"Lesley","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000709","middle_name":"Veronica","last_name":"Campbell","source_individual_id":"RMIS217039","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Lesley Campbell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76861","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62852","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigation of the role of specific mucous associated bacteria in children and young adults with Crohns disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Crohn's disease","FISH","bacteria","host-pathogen interaction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":510113,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Crohn's disease","aetiology","bacterial pathogens","children"],"scientific_title":"Investigation of the role of specific mucous associated bacteria in children and young adults with Crohns disease","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Infection Agents (incl.

IBD causes relapsing and remitting gut inflammation in relatively young populations of patients. Our understanding of causes of IBD is poor, but the diseases involve an interaction between the intestinal immune system, genetic predisposition and bacteria in the gut. One unexplained observation, made by a number of groups, is that removal of the appendix, especially if performed when young, protects against the later development of ulcerative colitis and probably Crohn s disease. If IBD does develop following earlier appendicectomy, it tends to be less severe. In this project, we plan to examine the immune features of the appendix, in human and mouse. The appendix is a major source of immune cells in the intestine but the nature of these cells and their functions are poorly understood. The aims of the project will explore the nature of immune cells, known as T lymphocytes, isolated from human and mouse appendices. Changes with age will be examined, to explain the age-related nature of the appendicectomy-IBD link. Anti- and pro-inflammatory characteristics of the cells will be studied, the migration pathways of these cells from appendix to other parts of the intestine will be clarified, and the therapeutic potential of these T cells in a mouse model of IBD will be elucidated. In addition, this will be the first study to develop and analyse a mouse model of appendicitis, which is very poorly understood. These studies will make important observations relevant not only to IBD, but to the immune function of the intestine, with implications for our fundamental understanding of the way we are protected from our hostile environment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Grimm","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025198","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Grimm","source_individual_id":"RMIS132630","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Grimm"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83483","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003008","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lloyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS117886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77503","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61654","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mortality among opioid dependent persons in pharmacotherapy, NSW 1985-2006","data":{"media_summary":"Opioid dependence","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Medical record linkage","Methadone","Mortality","Opioid dependence"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455451,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Addiction treatment","Heroin-related mortality","Methadone maintenance","Mortality","Opioid dependence"],"scientific_title":"Mortality among opioid dependent persons in pharmacotherapy, NSW 1985-2006","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Louisa Degenhardt","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455451","simplified_title":"Mortality in treatment for heroin dependence in NSW","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"148757.1","source_system":"Heroin dependence is a long term condition associated with high rates of death, illness and injury. Death rates are much higher than the general Australian population and the causes of death include drug intoxication or overdose, trauma, suicide, complications from blood born viruses such as Hepatitis C and HIV-AIDS and other medical complications of a chaotic drug-using lifestyle. As a part of a harm minimisation approach to heroin dependence, maintenance opioid pharmacotherapies seek to stabilise a chaotic heroin-using lifestyle by providing a regular dose of a legal, high quality opioid under medical supervision. Maintenance treatment uses long-acting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine to provide consistent blood opioid levels so the client avoids the constant and disruptive cycles of opioid intoxication and withdrawal. Clients in regular maintenance treatments have lower death rates than untreated heroin dependent people and better outcomes with regards to drug use. However, death still occurs in methadone and buprenorphine treatment and minimising death rates is an important goal of treatment programs. This is a large longitudinal study looking at all NSW methadone and buprenorphine clients between 1985 and 2006, an estimated 44,000 people. In particular, the study looks at their mortality. It is a data linkage project, in that it uses two existing databases (a treatment database and a mortality database) and combines the information for each subject to get a better picture of how long methadone and buprenorphine clients survive, how much maintenance treatment they have received, and what the clients die of. This is the first time the mortality of all NSW methadone and buprenorphine recipients will be examined in a systematic way. It will allow us to compare the mortality of subjects receiving methadone and buprenorphine treatments and look at changes in mortality rates and causes of death over time. This will be an important policy resource."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Tony Butler","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035664","middle_name":"Gerard","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"RMIS1784037","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Tony Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86235","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Professor Louisa Degenhardt","data":{"first_name":"Professor Louisa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030337","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Degenhardt","source_individual_id":"RMIS572179","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Professor Louisa Degenhardt"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84872","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Lucinda Burns","data":{"first_name":"Lucinda","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023870","middle_name":"Alleyne","last_name":"Burns","source_individual_id":"RMIS3812120","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Lucinda Burns"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83127","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Matthew Law","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020290","middle_name":"Gwyn","last_name":"Law","source_individual_id":"5015891","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Matthew Law"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82179","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Hall","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001997","middle_name":"Denis","last_name":"Hall","source_individual_id":"5012662","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Hall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77211","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61653","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A New Map of the Human Cerebral Cortex to assist the Interpretation of fMRI and PET Studies","data":{"media_summary":"Stroke","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Brain","Cerebral Cortex","Monkey","Neuroanatomy","Neuropathology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455450,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Ageing Well","Alzheimer's Disease","Brain Trauma","Schizophrenia","Stroke"],"scientific_title":"A New Map of the Human Cerebral Cortex to assist the Interpretation of fMRI and PET Studies","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof George Paxinos","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455450","simplified_title":"An Accurate Map of the Human Cortex","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"264307.38","source_system":"The cortex is the brain structure most intimately involved in cognition, motivation and emotion. It is thought to be the principal area affected in diseases such as schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. An enormous and costly effort is expended in functional neuroimaging with PET and fMRI to establish the relation between cortical regions and neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of an accurate map of the human cortex, the researcher is left only with crude estimates of the location of normal and abnormal cortical activity. Further, there is limited ability to relate the human data to the wealth of knowledge available on non-human primate brains. Conversely, researchers using animal models of human cortical pathology cannot readily relate their data to humans because the similarities between the brains of experimental animals and humans have not yet been comprehensively established. The present project will establish the similarities between the cortex of humans and rhesus monkeys. By revealing comprehensively the location of cortical areas this project will provide the context within which hypotheses of cortical function and dysfunction can be tested. The applicants were the first to use the distribution of chemical substances in the brain to construct a comprehensive map of the rat brain. This work is the only Australian publication ranked amongst the 50 most cited items in the history of science. They wish to apply similar techniques to study the least understood part of the human brain, the cortex.

It is responsible for significant sickness and death, particularly amongst children, and its incidence is on the increase. The reasons for this, and the underlying causes of allergic disease, remain unclear. Allergic disease results from the actions of molecules called IgE antibodies, which are also associated with parasitic infection. Even in these conditions, where IgE concentrations are raised in the blood, the concentrations are too low to allow their direct study. We have recently applied molecular biological techniques to study the genes that encode IgE antibodies. Our work suggests that the IgE response can sometimes develop in a different way to that of other antibodies (eg IgG). On the other hand, laboratory (in vitro) studies over many years support the possibility that IgE and IgG develop in parallel. In this study, we wish to identify circumstances in which IgG-like IgE antibodies develop. We therefore wish to study patients with different kinds of allergic disease, and patients with other conditions that are associated with IgE production. We therefore wish to study patients who have infections with parasitic worms. We deduce the processes that give rise to IgE antibodies by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in antibody genes during an immune response. Over recent years, we have developed new approaches to the analysis of such mutations, and this project also seeks to further develop our mutation analysis. This more powerful analysis will be applied to the study of mutations in the IgE genes seen in different patient groups, and should allow us to quantify the proportion of IgE antibodies that develop in each way. A better understanding of the relative contributions of the two pathways to IgE, in different conditions, will transform our understanding of the IgE response, and open up new avenues for the investigation of the causes and treatment of allergic disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"William Sewell","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0045360","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sewell","source_individual_id":"RMIS138628","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"William Sewell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88734","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Collins","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024202","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Collins","source_individual_id":"5014000","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Collins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83215","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr John Ruhno","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010007","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Ruhno","source_individual_id":"RMIS3150902","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr John Ruhno"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79416","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61651","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Relating genetic, biological, and behavioural markers of early vulnerability in conduct problem children.","data":{"media_summary":"genetic markers","end_year":2009,"keywords":["child development","clinical research","family risk factors","genetic polymorphisms"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455439,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["antisocial behaviour","child development","child psychopathy","early detection and intervention","genetic markers"],"scientific_title":"Relating genetic, biological, and behavioural markers of early vulnerability in conduct problem children.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Mark Dadds","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455439","simplified_title":"Genetics and behavioural style in conduct problem children.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"439183.42","source_system":"This research will conduct the first test of specific genetic risk in a large and representative sample of young conduct problem children.

In addition, anxiety is often present as a co-morbid feature of other major disorders, such as schizophrenia, substance use, and depression. Anxiety is one of the world's major health burdens; it costs $44 billion per year in the United States. Health agencies around the world are now putting unprecedented resources into understanding the neural bases of anxiety and its reduction. Building on recent advances in the neuroscience of anxiety, the Centre will expand the capacity for neurotransmitter modulation during therapy to reduce anxiety disorders.

problems begin in childhood and adolescence. Of these, oppositional-defiant and conduct problems in childhood are the most common precursor of all types of adult mental health problems. These children are the most common referral to child mental health clinics but little is known about which of these children will go in which direction i.e., good health, chronic antisocial behaviour, depression and anxiety, substance abuse, the psychoses. Progress in more accurately defining subgroups of these children would have huge implications for early intervention for mental health problems in our community. This project proposes the first large scale analysis of genetic distributions through to behavioural and treatment factors that characterise and differentiate a large representative sample of children with conduct problems. The project will test a model of child psychopathology that links genotype, via environmental risk and emotion processing problems, to an improved diagnostic-phenotypic model for treatment of the major childhood disorder. Clinical research activities will be structured into three intersecting arms: first, identifying the genetic and behavioural subtypes of early-onset conduct problems; second, innovative treatments for these children, and third, the dissemination of findings to these children and their families via the health care system. The research will build new collaborations between established and internationally recognised clinical research teams in childhood mental health, biological psychiatry, genetics and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Statewide Network (CAMHSNET).

The results will provide much needed information on how to intervene to prevent falls and fractures in this high risk population. In the last decade, 25 randomised controlled trials have been published which show it is possible to prevent falls in older people. However, a major disappointing outcome of research in this field is that trials that have included or specifically focused on older people with cognitive impairment have been unsuccessful in preventing falls. Cognitive impairment has long been known to be a major risk factor for falls and fractures but little research has been undertaken to understand the underlying mechanisms as to why this is the case. It is likely that previous falls prevention trials involving people with cognitive impairment were unsuccessful because they did not directly assess mechanisms for falls in this group and simply translated intervention strategies from studies undertaken in cognitively intact older people. This study aims to develop our understanding of the important factors that contribute to risk of falling in older people with cognitive impairment and dementia. Participants will be recruited from a number of sources including hospitals, out-patient clinics, retirement villages, hostels etc. Whilst some participants will be able to consent to take part, all participants must have a nominated person responsible. Consenting participants will undergo a series of assessments, the majority of which can be undertaken in their own home. These will include medical and medication history, measures of gait and balance and tests assessing performance of different regions of the brain. An MRI scan will allow us to determine whether risk of falling relates to any specific pathology in different parts of the brain. We anticipate that we will be able to identify which risk factors and underlying mechanisms are most strongly associated with falling in cognitively impaired older people. We then hope to use the information to design targeted and tailored intervention strategies to reduce falls and fractures in this high risk population."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Lord","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038138","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lord","source_individual_id":"RMIS5224","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Lord"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86883","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jacqueline Close","data":{"first_name":"Jacqueline","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000938","middle_name":"Ct","last_name":"Close","source_individual_id":"RMIS3793413","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jacqueline Close"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76924","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61630","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Using clinical and economic evidence to infrom local decision making in cancer care","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Cancer treatment","Health care utilization","Health outcomes","Therapeutics","cost effectiveness"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455366,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Using clinical and economic evidence to infrom local decision making in cancer care","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Robyn Ward","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455366","simplified_title":"Incorporating economic evidence into standard cancer treatments","sub_type":"Health Services Research","total_budget":"1836745.73","source_system":"Medicines used to treat cancer often come with a high price tag. Many countries, including Australia, are no longer able to provide free access to all medicines. For this reason, patients and their families, public hospitals and private health insurers are often asked to pay for these treatments. Currently, health professionals and patients are ill-equipped to make informed treatment choices, since both cost and efficacy must be considered. Our proposed research will address this important gap in current knowledge. We will use a unique web-based resource (Cancer Institute NSW Standard Cancer Treatment Program; CI-SCaT) to communicate the economic evidence needed to make informed decisions about cancer treatments. Our project will provide public access to information about the effectiveness and costs of cancer drugs. This is a world first. CI-SCaT is already the main vehicle of communication about cancer drug treatments in NSW and is widely used by cancer health professionals and patients to inform point-of-care decisions. Our project we will also identify the factors which influence the ability of cancer treatment centres to make best use of their drug budgets. By achieving this goal, we hope to demonstrate how to best use scarce resources for the benefit of all cancer patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kees Van

Current treatment for AMI includes mechanical (percutaneous coronary intervention) or thrombolytic therapy; however, these approaches are directed primarily at epicardial arteries rather than the myocardium and are, therefore, suboptimal. Strategies aimed at directly protecting cardiomyocytes from ischaemia-reperfusion injury, reducing leukocyte recruitment and myocardial cell death, would complement current approaches restoring epicardial artery flow and are keenly sought. This project will demonstrate the capacity of two separate gene-silencing strategies (DNAzymes and siRNA to suppress the expression of the immediate-early gene, c-Jun in cardiomyocytes and reduce infarct size, left ventricular dysfunction, apoptosis, inflammation, production of reactive oxygen species, angiogenesis and fibrosis in the injured rat myocardium.

The significance of these latent stores is underscored by the finding that the level of these stores correlates with prostate cancer outcome, and also that very high circulating levels of active MIC-1 cytokine in the blood, leads to the massive weight loss characteristic of a syndrome called cancer cachexia. This is common in late stages of cancer and is a major contributing factor to the death of cancer patients.

While we have discovered RNA molecules that can do this to HIV in the test tube, we wish to develop similar molecules that can be used in animal models, so that we can decide whether this technology can be developed for use in humans. We also wish to understand more clearlky the mechanisms underlying this effect. BACKGROUND These RNA molecules can suppress a range of pathogenic human viruses including HIV-1 in the test tube. Our novel approach appears to induce changes that are long lasting and are less susceptible to mutations by the virus that allow it to become resistant to other therapeutic strategies. RESEARCH PLAN Initially more work will be done in tissue culture to determine the optimal design of these molecules and the best way to administer them. The most promising of these designs will be tested in small groups of infected animals as a preliminary demonstration of efficacy. In parallel experiments will be performed to elucidate the mechanisms undelying the suppressive effects of these molecules.

Toll like receptors (TLR) are a new group of cell surface receptors tinflammatory mediators.hat are important in immune function and the immune system's ability to recognise and respond to to microbes by recognising signature molecules contained in microbes. The TLR system is the early warning system of immune defence and activation of the TLR system induces the generation of multiple mediators that initiate and perpetuate inflammation. There has been intense interest and research into this novel family of receptors and they have been shown to play an important role in human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. The role of TLRs in uveitis has not been studied. We hypothesise that TLRs play a central role linking certain bacteria and the induction of uveitis. TLR4, a member of the TLR family has been clearly identified as the key receptor for cell wall components of gram negative bacteria (a chemical called LPS). In vitro data shows that TLR4 stimulation by LPS causes the release of inflammatory mediators. This project is designed to study the expression of TLRs in the eye, factors that control their expression and the results of stimultaing TLRs with their target chemicals. Better understanding ofd the causes and mechanisms of uveitis will allow the development of more specific and effective treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Mccluskey","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044125","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Mccluskey","source_individual_id":"RMIS3865830","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Mccluskey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88433","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Denis Wakefield","data":{"first_name":"Denis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022778","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wakefield","source_individual_id":"RMIS72560","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Denis Wakefield"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82868","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Nick Di Girolamo","data":{"first_name":"Nick","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0001273","middle_name":"","last_name":"Di Girolamo","source_individual_id":"RMIS6903664","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Nick Di Girolamo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77019","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61619","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The extinction of conditioned fear and its implications for cue exposure therapy","data":{"media_summary":"memory","end_year":2009,"keywords":["amygdala","anxiety disorders","conditioning","fear","learning and memory"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455319,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["amygdala","anxiety","anxiety disorders","learning","memory"],"scientific_title":"The extinction of conditioned fear and its implications for cue exposure therapy","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Reginald Westbrook","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455319","simplified_title":"The extinction of conditioned fear","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"322430.03","source_system":"This project studies extinction of Pavlovian conditioned fear reactions in rats. Extinction of these reactions is an animal model for exposure therapy used in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people. In exposure therapy, the patient, aided by the clinician, confronts trauma-related cues in the absence of any overt danger. The intention of this therapy is to reduce the ability of the trauma-related cues to provoke the fear reactions that are undermining the patient's quality of life. In Pavlovian conditioning, subjects (typically rats) are exposed to a signaling relation between an initially neutral stimulus (e.g., a noise) and a feared outcome (e.g., foot shock). When later repeatedly exposed to the initially neutral but now feared stimulus (the noise) in the absence of the feared outcome, the fear reactions it acquired progressively decline until eventually it fails to elicit any such reactions. The fear reactions are said to have been extinguished. There has been significant progress in understanding the psychological processes and neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition of fear reactions, but much less is known about the processes and mechanisms underlying the extinction of these reactions. The project has two general objectives. The first is to determine the conditions of extinction training that promote long-term loss of fear reactions. The second objective is to determine how the brain controls this extinction of learned fear. Achieving these aims will be significant for two reasons. First, it will contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which animals (including people) learn to adjust their behaviour to bring it into line with the current relations that exist between events in the world. Second, it will provide important information about how such adjustment is facilitated or impaired across extinction training and, thereby, contribute towards understanding both the successes and failures of cue exposure therapy for fear-related disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Justin Harris","data":{"first_name":"Justin","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025346","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Harris","source_individual_id":"RMIS159288","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Justin Harris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83526","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Reginald Westbrook","data":{"first_name":"Reginald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017046","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Westbrook","source_individual_id":"5018254","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Reginald Westbrook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81327","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61618","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Corticospinal transmission in human subjects","data":{"media_summary":"stroke","end_year":2009,"keywords":["central nervous system","corticospinal","human","motoneurone","synaptic plasticity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455316,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["ageing","prior polio","rehabilitation","spinal cord injury","stroke"],"scientific_title":"Corticospinal transmission in human subjects","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455316","simplified_title":"Corticospinal transmission in human subjects","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"393201.49","source_system":"The corticospinal pathway is the major route from the brain to the spinal cord for the control of voluntary movement in people. Little is known about how transmission through this pathway might alter with activity. It is known that, elsewhere in the brain, connections between nerve cells can be made stronger or weaker by specific patterns of activity and it is thought that such changes underlie learning and memory. We propose that similar changes might happen in the spinal cord at the connection between the nerve cells which carry signals from the brain and the nerve cells which carry the signals out to the muscle. This project will demonstrate that the connections in the pathway from the brain to the muscle can be strengthened or weakened in a controlled way by imposed patterns of activity. In addition, we know that after voluntary contractions, there are dramatic changes in the way signals in this pathway are transmitted to muscles. After brief strong voluntary contractions, muscle responses are immediately reduced. After longer contractions in which the muscles become fatigued, the reduction is followed by an increase in responses which can last many minutes. Thus, this project will also study changes in the pathway from the brain to the muscle after natural activity. The effects of changes induced by artificial or natural activity on the control of voluntary movement will also be investigated. Understanding how activity drives changes in the pathway that controls voluntary movement is important for all situations that involve learning motor tasks. These include normal development and learning of motor skills, as well as rehabilitation after all kinds of nerve or muscle injury. It is also important in understanding motor changes that occur when activity is altered by disorders like spinal cord injury or stroke. Improved understanding of the processes occuring should allow improvement in rehabilitation therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Janet","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004957","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS220761","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78042","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jane Butler","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000667","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"RMIS706035","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jane Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76844","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61617","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanism of signal transduction and receptor activation in ligand gated ion channel receptors","data":{"media_summary":"startle disease","end_year":2009,"keywords":["glycine receptors","ligand gated ion channels","molecular neuroscience","patch clamping","substituted cysteine accessibility method"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455310,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["channelopathies","hyperekplexia","ion channel diseases","neurotransmission","startle disease"],"scientific_title":"Mechanism of signal transduction and receptor activation in ligand gated ion channel receptors","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Peter Schofield","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455310","simplified_title":"Understanding how receptors convert neurotransmitter binding into biological signals","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"551560.05","source_system":"This project seeks to provide fundamental new information about the means by which neurotransmitter receptors, which mediate fast synaptic neurotransmission, operate. This knowledge is important since the Cys-loop family of ligand gated ion channel receptors are responsible for a wide range of neuronal signalling and the control of both excitatory and inhibitory receptors. The Cys-loop receptors are modulated by both therapeutic drugs (eg. benzodiazepines, barbiturates, antiemetics) and by recreational drugs (eg. alcohol, nicotine). They are also targets for development of new therapeutic drugs, such as allosteric modulators of nAChR for memory enhancement, or modulating GlyR to relieve spasticity or chronic pain. The project will use a range of molecular advances made by this and other laboratories to clarify how neurotransmitters enable their receptors to activate and signal. This fundamental information is of major medical significance as defective synaptic transmission, caused by mutations in ligand gated ion channel receptors, gives rise to a number of neurological and psychiatric disease states. The ligand gated receptors are also major targets for therapeutic drugs and the information gained in this study may also provide insights into new ways in which drugs could be used to enhance or inhibit synaptic signalling."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"John Clements","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0029990","middle_name":"","last_name":"Clements","source_individual_id":"RMIS221799","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"John Clements"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84770","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Trevor Lewis","data":{"first_name":"Trevor","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020381","middle_name":"Murray","last_name":"Lewis","source_individual_id":"5020271","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Trevor Lewis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82206","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Schofield","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016107","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Schofield","source_individual_id":"5017396","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Schofield"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81058","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Peter Barry","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005976","middle_name":"Hosford","last_name":"Barry","source_individual_id":"RMIS6624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Peter Barry"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78333","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61616","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular typing and epidemiology of Bordetella pertussis in Australia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Bacterial pathogen","Genotyping","Pertussis","evolution","molecular epidemiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455308,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Bacterial pathogen","Vaccine-preventable disease","epidemiology","whooping cough"],"scientific_title":"Molecular typing and epidemiology of Bordetella pertussis in Australia","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Ruiting Lan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455308","simplified_title":"Molecular typing and epidemiology of Bordetella pertussis in Australia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"552662.71","source_system":"Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is an acute respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis.

Indeed the incidence has been increasing in recent years with over 11,000 cases notified in 2005.Pertussis is the commonest of all vaccine preventable diseases targeted by the Australian standard vaccination schedule. To control pertussis, appropriate epidemiological surveillance must be implemented to monitor the circulating B. pertussis strains and emergence of any new strains, in particular those that escape the protection by vaccines. This project will use a novel genomic comparison approach to find variation known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present around the genome. We will use these SNPs to analyse a large collection of Australian and worldwide isolates to identify those SNPs most suitable for typing and determine the optimal number of SNPs needed for discrimination. A standardized, consistent and reliable typing method for strain identification will be established. We will further develop an integrated method for detecting known variation in the genes encoding the five acellular vaccine antigens. A combined method for strain identification and detection of antigenic variation will then be developed for culture-independent typing, enabling identification of the strain infecting an individual directly from a clinical sample without the need for culture. This study will establish molecular methods for surveillance of pertussis in Australia, essential for further improvement of acellular pertussis vaccines and public health control measures."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Vitali Sintchenko","data":{"first_name":"Vitali","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033848","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sintchenko","source_individual_id":"5012065","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Vitali Sintchenko"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85767","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gwendolyn Gilbert","data":{"first_name":"Gwendolyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030884","middle_name":"Lesley","last_name":"Gilbert","source_individual_id":"5012064","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gwendolyn Gilbert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85008","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Reeves","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009858","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Reeves","source_individual_id":"RMIS144697","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Reeves"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79377","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ruiting Lan","data":{"first_name":"Ruiting","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0008515","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lan","source_individual_id":"RMIS144700","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Ruiting Lan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79008","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61615","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"S100 Proteins in asthma","data":{"media_summary":"oxidant scavengers","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Inflammatory mediators","S100 proteins","novel antibodies","oxidation and nitric oxide","transgenics and murine models"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455307,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Allergic inflammation","Anti-inflammatory drugs","Asthma","macrophages and eosinophils","oxidant scavengers"],"scientific_title":"S100 Proteins in asthma","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Carolyn Geczy","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455307","simplified_title":"How novel inflammation-related proteins mediate responses in asthma","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"561978.39","source_system":"This project will examine new ways in which the major effector cells of allergic inflammation and asthma are regulated by novel S100 protein mediators. We find two natural proteins of the innate immune system, present in cells in the lungs of patients with acute asthma. These have apparently opposing activates: one, S100A12, activates mast cells to release mediators that trigger asthma attack. We will characterise how this proteins is regulated in eosinophils, key cells in asthma. Because mast cells reside in almost all body tissues and are also important mediators of host responses to allergy, infection and in chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, our studies may indicate novel and unexpected ways in which they are activated. A second S100 protein (S100A8) is an efficient scavenger of oxidants that can cause damage to the lung. We find both S100A12 and S100A8 that has been modified by oxidants, in sputum from pateints with asthma. In addition to its anti-oxidant effects, S100A8 can downregulate production of some of the inflammatory mediators that promote allergy and asthma. This is an important finding that will help us understand how drugs used in treatment, such as steroids, are acting. We will generate a mouse expressing this protein in its lungs and determine how this affects normal lungs and the course of asthma. If, as we expect, asthma is reduced, we will have found a novel new pathway that is important in the resolution of asthma. Results from this project will provide new knowledge concerning mechanisms of regulation in allergy and asthma and may lead to the design of novel strategies to regulate the process. Results will have broader ramifications applicable to other chronc inflammatory where these proteins are expressed.

Although certain treatments, such as lowering blood cholesterol levels, reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis, current motality rates from this disease indicate that there is still a great need to improve our understanding and treament of the condition. In the development of atherosclerosis, some of the cells in the vessel wall accumulate large deposits of cholesterol. These cells are macrophages, derived from circulating white blood cells that have migrated into the vessel wall. Normally these cells are able to efficiently export excess cholesterol, but this process seems to fail in atherosclerosis. This project will study the molecular mechanism for cholesterol export from macrophages, concentrating on a the mechnisms by which recently identified cholesterol pumps operate. These are located in cell membranes, including at the cell surface, which is the site at which cholesterol is transferred to acceptors such as HDL and apoAI.

It contains many proteins (enzymes) which break down food. One of the more serious complications of alcohol (ethanol) abuse is pancreatitis, a condition that has both acute and chronic manifestations. Patients with acute pancreatitis suffer from acute abdominal pain; in severe cases the condition can be fatal. Repeated attacks of acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis, a condition in which, normal pancreatic tissue is lost and is replaced by scarring. This disease causes chronic pain, inability to digest food with consequent malnutrition and destruction of the insulin producing cells of the gland leading to diabetes. The mechanisms by which alcohol causes pancreatitis are not yet known. Although it is well established that the risk of developing pancreatitis increases with increasing intake of alcohol, suggesting that alcohol exerts toxic effects on the gland, it is also clear that not all alcoholics develop pancreatitis, indicating that an additional trigger factor-susceptibility factor is required to produce overt disease. The proposed project aims to determine the mechanisms responsible for alcohol-induced acute and chronic pancreatitis. It seeks i) to determine whether toxins from gut bacteria (endotoxins) may act as the trigger factor for acute alcoholic pancreatitis; and ii) to characterise the effects of alcohol and endotoxin on the cells responsible for pancreatic scarring, namely, pancreatic stellate cells. Our experiments will involve an animal model of alcohol feeding as well as pancreatic cells grown in dishes (cultured cells). Identification of the pathways by which alcohol causes pancreatic injury may enable the development of treatment strategies to prevent and-or retard the progress of alcoholic pancreatitis"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Romano Pirola","data":{"first_name":"Romano","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044848","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Pirola","source_individual_id":"RMIS536467","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Romano Pirola"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88609","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeremy Wilson","data":{"first_name":"Jeremy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017153","middle_name":"Somers","last_name":"Wilson","source_individual_id":"RMIS226345","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jeremy Wilson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81357","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Minoti Apte","data":{"first_name":"Minoti","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000128","middle_name":"V","last_name":"Apte","source_individual_id":"RMIS536455","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Minoti Apte"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76686","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61610","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomized controlled trial of a general practice based intervention to prevent chronic vascular disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Behaviour change","Cardiovascular disease prevention","Diabetes prevention"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455268,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Health services research","Prevention medicine","Primary health care"],"scientific_title":"A randomized controlled trial of a general practice based intervention to prevent chronic vascular disease","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Mark Harris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455268","simplified_title":"Chronic disease prevention in general practice","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"774357.68","source_system":"Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes contribute greatly to the burden of disease in Australian society. Prevention of these conditions is a high priority for the health system. There is increasing evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to prevent chronic disease in those at high risk. However the feasibility of intervening through general practice and other existing services has not been demonstrated. We have previously conducted research on a structured approach to helping patients with risk factors for chronic disease (such as smoking, poor nutrition, hazardous alcohol consumption and physical inactivity) including both cardiovascular disease and diabetes in general practice. This study aims to evaluate the impact of recalling patients to general practice for a visit to assess their risk of chronic disease and to help them to lower their risk by changes to smoking, diet, alcohol consumption and physical activity behaviours. Practices in the intervention group will receive training, practice visits, resources, and referral pathways to enable them to invite eligible patients to attend the practice for an assessment and management of their risk factors. This will include provision of education materials, support for behaviour change, referral to diet education and physical activity program and follow up. The feasibility of this type of vascular disease prevention intervention for high-risk patients has not been trialled previously in Australia. The findings of this research will help to inform Australian and State health policy especially the preventive care initiatives recently announced by the Council of Australian Governments. It will also inform practice leading to better guidelines for general practice preventive care, better support for general practice to provide preventive care for patients at risk of chronic disease and better support for patients to reduce their risk of chronic disease by changing their behaviour."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Gaynor Heading","data":{"first_name":"Gaynor","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031218","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Heading","source_individual_id":"RMIS4573815","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Gaynor Heading"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85085","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Harris","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019476","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Harris","source_individual_id":"RMIS575752","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Harris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81960","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Patrick Powell Davies","data":{"first_name":"Patrick","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015659","middle_name":"Gawaine","last_name":"Powell Davies","source_individual_id":"RMIS4573807","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Patrick Powell Davies"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80948","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Suzanne Mckenzie","data":{"first_name":"Suzanne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014880","middle_name":"Helen","last_name":"Mckenzie","source_individual_id":"5016377","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Suzanne Mckenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80724","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Lyle","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008776","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Lyle","source_individual_id":"5016093","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Lyle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79076","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Megan Passey","data":{"first_name":"Megan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003867","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Passey","source_individual_id":"5012061","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Megan Passey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77744","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61608","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The regulation of apolipoprotein E secretion by human macrophages","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["apolipoprotein E","cell biology","macrophage","protein secretion"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455251,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","cardiovascular","cholesterol","inflammation"],"scientific_title":"The regulation of apolipoprotein E secretion by human macrophages","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Leonard Kritharides","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455251","simplified_title":"Macrophage apoE secretion","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"516078.39","source_system":"One of the major inflammatory cells in the body, the macrophage, is involved in a number of diseases, including coronary disease.

There are many differences in the ways that blood vessels control this balance in different parts of the body. Such differences are altered in vascular diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, which are prevalent in obesity, such that constriction generally outweighs dilation. However, what these differences are and how they occur are not well understood. While current drugs for treating vascular disease either reduce vessel constriction or increase dilation, they are not specific for individual arteries; a situation that would allow us to control vascular diseases in a very specific manner. Recently, we have described differences between the ways that individual vessels are controlled. These changes relate to differences in the way that different vessels dilate. AIMS - To further understand normal blood vessel function and the changes that occur in blood vessels in cardiovascular disease, with a focus on the ways that blood vessels dilate in normal states and in obesity-related diseases, such as in hypertension and diabetes. - The eventual aim is to identify the specific ways that arteries function, so that artery-specific drug targets can be identified to treat disease-related changes in cardiovascular disease in a very specific manner. EXPECTED OUTCOMES This project will contribute to understanding blood vessel function in health and disease. The expected eventual outcome is the identification of the mechanisms that underlie the function of different arteries in different parts of the body, so that specific individual vessel function can be targeted to treat vascular disease. Additionally, this work will also verify the relevance of the diet-induced obesity animal model, in terms of the characteristics and causes of human obesity and related cardiovascular disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Shaun Sandow","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033616","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Sandow","source_individual_id":"5017327","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Shaun Sandow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85707","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Margaret Morris","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009227","middle_name":"Joan","last_name":"Morris","source_individual_id":"5016557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Margaret Morris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79210","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61605","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel neuromechanical measurements of the human upper airway in health and disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Biomechanics","Magnetic resonance imaging","Sleep apnoea","Upper airway function"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455228,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Airway structure","Breathing instability during sleep","Obstructive sleep apnoea"],"scientific_title":"Novel neuromechanical measurements of the human upper airway in health and disease","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Lynne Bilston","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455228","simplified_title":"Biomechanics of the human upper airway in health and disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"543728.45","source_system":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition, in which the upper airway repeatedly collapses during sleep, causing the oxygen concentration in the blood to drop, carbon dioxide to rise, and the person to arouse in order to re-establish adequate oxygen supply. Consequences of OSA include increased daytime sleepiness, increased risk of accidents, and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. It most commonly affects middle-aged males, but is also seen in the broader population. OSA is associated with obesity and specific shapes of the upper airway and facial structure. These anatomical factors can be compensated for while awake but inadequate activity of the muscles surrounding the upper airway during sleep contributes to an increased predisposition of the airway to collapse. Airway collapse occurs when the muscles are unable to withstand the low pressures in the airway and collapse, obstructing the airway. This project will measure the stiffness and motion of the muscles surrounding the airway, in healthy people and those with OSA, to determine how these influence airway collapsibility. We will use two novel non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques, MR Elastography, and MR tagging which will allow us to quantify the airway stiffness, or elasticity, and its motion (deformation). These will be the first direct measurements of the upper airway elasticity and deformation in humans. We will also measure how various treatments, such as CPAP therapy and mandibular advancement affect airway elasticity and deformation, so that their mechanisms can be better understood. This may also explain why some patients do not benefit from these therapies. These studies may lead to new diagnostic and treatment modalities, as well as gaining important insights into the basic mechanisms of airway collapse in humans."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lynne Bilston","data":{"first_name":"Lynne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041123","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Bilston","source_individual_id":"5013479","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Lynne Bilston"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87664","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Mckenzie","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038434","middle_name":"Kenneth","last_name":"Mckenzie","source_individual_id":"5016369","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr David Mckenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86957","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Gandevia","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030812","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Gandevia","source_individual_id":"5014771","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Simon Gandevia"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84990","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61603","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Influence of early-life viral infection on severity of murine chronic asthma and acute exacerbations","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["airway inflammation","asthma","chronic inflammation","respiratory allergy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455223,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["acute and chronic asthma","asthma and allergy","respiratory viral infection"],"scientific_title":"Influence of early-life viral infection on severity of murine chronic asthma and acute exacerbations","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Rakesh Kumar","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455223","simplified_title":"Influence of childhood viral infection on severity of asthma and its exacerbations","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"508528.39","source_system":"This project examines the relationship between certain childhood infections with respiratory viruses and the progression of asthma later in life.

The hand is supremely adapted for manual skills ranging from writing and playing a musical instrument to non-verbal communications via gesture and pointing. How is the range of hand skills achieved? We are motivated to study this because the ability of the hand to recovery from some neurological disorders, particularly stroke, is very poor. One important element in virtually all activities of the hand is precise movement of the thumb. The tip of the thumb is flexed by a single muscle, a muscle only present in humans. We want to determine how this muscle works, and how the force it produces affects the whole hand. We will use specialised neurophysiological techniques to do this in human volunteers. There is no comparable animal model for this type of work due to significant differences at both the level of the brain and the level of the muscle. Second, we want to understand better how the cells in the spinal cord which control the hand (and other) muscles work. We have two new ways to do this, including a novel technique which can activate these cells with a form of stimulation that may help us improve functional electrical stimulation. Finally, with 27 bones and more than 25 muscles which operate it, the hand is not simple to control. We will use a new apparatus to measure how well it is controlled, and we will directly stimulate the motor areas of the brain to evaluate the control. From this, we will come up with new understanding, as well as new stimulus and measurement techniques that can be applied to patients with impaired hand function, as occurs all too often after stroke."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Gandevia","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030812","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Gandevia","source_individual_id":"5014771","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Simon Gandevia"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84990","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Janet","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004957","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS220761","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78042","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61600","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Defining the colonic abnormality underlying severe constipation and evaluating the efficacy of a novel treatment therapy","data":{"media_summary":"slow transit constipation","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Clinical research","Pacemaker","colon","gastrointestinal manometry","pathophysiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455213,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["clinical diagnosis and assessment","colonic dysmotiliy in adults","motility disorder","quality of life","slow transit constipation"],"scientific_title":"Defining the colonic abnormality underlying severe constipation and evaluating the efficacy of a novel treatment therapy","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ian Cook","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455213","simplified_title":"Colonic abnormalities in slow transit constipation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"487990.08","source_system":"This project aims to clarify the contractile patterns of the human colon which underlie the very common and distressing condition of constipation.

In Australia, 33% of those with opioid use disorders and 24% of those with amphetamine use disorders have comorbid PTSD. The prevalence among people with alcohol use disorders on the other hand, is comparably low (5%). Despite the high prevalence of PTSD among people with IDUD, research on treatment responses to this significant problem is sparse. Individuals with this comorbidity present a significant challenge to substance abuse treatment providers as they present with a poorer clinical profile, and have poorer treatment outcomes, including higher readmission rates. Consequently, they are a costly burden to the health care system. The costs of this comorbidity to individual sufferers and society may be reduced substantially by the implementation of an integrated treatment that addresses both disorders concurrently. There is however, little research to guide how best to treat comorbid IDUD and PTSD. Although a small number of interventions have been developed and trialled, none have been evaluated in an Australian setting. One intervention which has shown promise in the United States is Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorder (CTPSD). Preliminary research has shown that CTPSD can be used safely and is effective in the treatment of PTSD among individuals with cocaine dependence. Completers of the program have demonstrated significant reductions in all PTSD symptom clusters and cocaine use from baseline to end of treatment which were maintained at 6 month follow-up. Significant reductions in depressive symptoms were also observed. Despite these promising results, CTPSD is yet to undergo a randomised controlled trial. The proposed study is a randomised controlled trial of the efficacy of CTPSD in the Australian setting."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Maree Teesson","data":{"first_name":"Maree","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040024","middle_name":"","last_name":"Teesson","source_individual_id":"RMIS184690","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Maree Teesson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87369","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Claudia Sannibale","data":{"first_name":"Claudia","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039513","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sannibale","source_individual_id":"RMIS3787114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Claudia Sannibale"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87247","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Katherine Mills","data":{"first_name":"Katherine","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026767","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Mills","source_individual_id":"5016479","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Katherine Mills"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83933","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Sally Hopwood","data":{"first_name":"Sally","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0025568","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hopwood","source_individual_id":"RMIS3787117","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Sally Hopwood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83583","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Amanda Baker","data":{"first_name":"Amanda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005910","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Baker","source_individual_id":"RMIS87506","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Amanda Baker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78314","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Sudie Back","data":{"first_name":"Sudie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005891","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Back","source_individual_id":"RMIS4565181","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Sudie Back"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78309","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61598","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"DESPATCH: DElivering Stroke Prevention for Atrial Fibrillation: assisting evidence-based CHoice in primary care","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["best practice","evidence-based clinical practice","patient management","primary health care","randomised controlled trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455207,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["atrial fibrillation","stroke","stroke prevention","stroke risk"],"scientific_title":"DESPATCH: DElivering Stroke Prevention for Atrial Fibrillation: assisting evidence-based CHoice in primary care","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Melina Gattellari","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455207","simplified_title":"Reducing stroke risk in patients with Atrial Fibrillation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"561447.1","source_system":"Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a common heart condition associated with a major risk of fatal and disabling stroke.

The National Institute of Clinical Studies of Australia summarised the large, unrealised benefit of anticoagulation, stating that 'each year, for every 1000 patients with NVAF given anticoagulants, we can assume that about 25 fewer people will experience a stroke and 12 fewer will die from a stroke than would be the case if they were not given them'. Despite this realisation, there is a lack of evidence to support any strategy to improve the care of patients with NVAF. This study seeks to optimise the management of NVAF in general practice.

Mast cells have been implicated in a range of inflammatory disorders such as asthma and more recently they have been shown to participate in immunity against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Although a lot of work has been performed to analyze how mast cells respond to different stimuli and what factors are important in their activation, there is little work available concerning what in the mast cell controls it's ability to become a mast cell and not any other cell. We have identified a specific protein that has been designated RasGRP4 which is restricted to mast cells and has, we believe, an important role to play not only in guiding immature cells to become mast cells but also in controlling some of the important functions of mast cells. Understanding this molecule more extensively will give us a much better understanding of diseases that the mast cell is involved in such as asthma and other inflammatory disorders.

This results in a reduced IQ and marked visuospatial deficiencies. However, unlike other forms of mental retardation, some important cognitive abilities are completely normal. WS patients show normal development of linguistic abilities and anecdotal evidence suggests they possess an above average musical ability. In addition, these individuals also possess a characteristic overfriendly, gregarious personality with little inhibition towards strangers. Such a characteristic cognitive and behavioral profile in a genetic disorder has provided convincing evidence that genes play a role in specifying cognitive abilities and behavior. This interesting syndrome gives us an insight into the perplexing debate of Nature vs Nurture. It also provides a unique and invaluable opportunity to dissect the role of certain genes in complex neurodevelopmental pathways that result in cognition and behavior. Recently, patients with smaller (atypical) deletions of genes in the WS region have been described. These patients do not display the full 'classical' range of WS characteristics. The identification of which genes are deleted in these patients suggests that two genes in particular, GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I, are involved in visuospatial abilities, sociability and specific anxieties and phobias. Our laboratory was the first to identify proteins encoded by GTF2IRD1, known as MusTRDs, that act for the most part to suppress gene expression. Furthermore, our laboratory has been studying a mouse model in which the Gtf2ird1 gene has been deleted, similar to the situation in WS, and have found that the mice are more 'social' and exploratory. In this project, we want to determine if other behavioural features of WS are contributed to by this gene and-or its related gene, Gtf2i, and to characterize the role that these genes play in neuronal cell function."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Enoch Tay","data":{"first_name":"Enoch","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045765","middle_name":"Se","last_name":"Tay","source_individual_id":"5030378","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Enoch Tay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88837","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Anthony Hannan","data":{"first_name":"Anthony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025310","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Hannan","source_individual_id":"5015052","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Anthony Hannan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83516","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Edna Hardeman","data":{"first_name":"Edna","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007725","middle_name":"Christine","last_name":"Hardeman","source_individual_id":"5015078","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Edna Hardeman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78790","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61023","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Translating population based mental health and ageing research into evidence-based prevention and policy","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["Biological Psychology","Epidemiology","Mental Health","Population and Ecological Genetics","Preventive Medicine"],"nhmrc_grant_id":418020,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Translating population based mental health and ageing research into evidence-based prevention and policy","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Helen Christensen","higher_grant_type":"Capacity","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/418020","simplified_title":"Improving mental health and Wellbeing by training new researchers","sub_type":"Population Health Capacity Building Grant","total_budget":"2370357.54","source_system":"Mental health problems and cognitive impairment are major causes of disability in Australia. To tackle these areas, we need to understand their causes, how to prevent them, and the best ways of using this information to improve health for all Australians. This project aims to develop six young researchers in five areas of need so that future relevant and responsive research in mental health and ageing is undertaken. In area 1, researchers will learn to develop and test Internet interventions that reduce anxiety, depression and drug use. People with no access to doctors or who wish to remain anonymous can then self-treat using these proven tools. Area 2 provides training so that researchers from different expert areas understand enough of each other's discipline to tackle the process of ageing - to understand how to stay healthy longer and how to avoid dementia. This area requires expertise and collaboration in genetics, biology, psychology, mathematical modelling and imaging (brain scans), to name just a few specialities required. Area 3 provides training in statistical methods. New methods are needed to analyse increasingly complex and large data sets. In Area 4 researchers are trained to conduct research that consumers (people with anxiety and depression) want to see done. Researchers with direct experience of anxiety and depression will be trained to produce high quality research that meets the needs of those who have these disorders. Finally, Area 5 provides training in getting the outcomes of the research understood by those who make decisions about health priorities and budgets. Many of the gaps in capacity we will address have come about by rapid developments in health and communication technologies and by the recognition that research needs to be more relevant and responsible. Because these gaps require the development of sophisticated knowledge, and the development of new techniques, knowledge and processes, long term stable funding is required."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helen Christensen","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029942","middle_name":"","last_name":"Christensen","source_individual_id":"5011546","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Helen Christensen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84752","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Mackinnon","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020552","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Mackinnon","source_individual_id":"5011964","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Mackinnon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82252","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Butterworth","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006356","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Butterworth","source_individual_id":"5013726","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Butterworth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78429","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kathleen Griffiths","data":{"first_name":"Kathleen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001924","middle_name":"Margaret","last_name":"Griffiths","source_individual_id":"5011901","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Kathleen Griffiths"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77194","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Easteal","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001407","middle_name":"","last_name":"Easteal","source_individual_id":"5012399","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Simon Easteal"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77062","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kaarin Anstey","data":{"first_name":"Kaarin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000118","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Anstey","source_individual_id":"RMIS223482","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kaarin Anstey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76684","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60977","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Equipment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":467205,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Ms Kate Taylor","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/467205","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"535957","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Kate Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Kate","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0028321","middle_name":"","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS4744453","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Kate Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84319","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60909","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Second Generation of HIV Surveillance in Kiribati","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["HIV"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455401,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Second Generation of HIV Surveillance in Kiribati","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health Information Systems (incl.

The null hypotheses for general and cause-specific mortality (age-adjusted) are that: (a) there has been no decline in mortality in Aboriginal people attending AMS Redfern over 30 years covering 1972-2001; (b) survival in the AMS cohort is similar to that recorded in Aboriginal people from NT and WA (mostly rural) for similar time periods; (c) comparisons of the AMS cohort mortality with overall NSW mortality are similar to previously published comparisons of NT-WA Aboriginal mortality compared to overall Australian mortality data. Major causes of mortality will centre on endocrine (mainly diabetes), cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases, and on external causes, including suicide-violence and accidental death. The mortality study will be extended back to the inception of the AMS, and will rely on computerisation of name(s), sex, date of birth and date of first and last AMS attendance for the whole AMS patient data base, to provide information for matching of patient records with the National Death Index (for deaths from 1980) and for matching with the NSW mortality data for 1971-79 (as there is no

functional capacity, and an active engagement in life. The most important ingredient of healthy ageing is a healthy brain, bereft of age-related diseases and dysfunction. Brain ageing and brain diseases are determined by multiple genetic factors that interact with environmental influences. The genes are multiple, the majority of which have a small influence. This study is an attempt to identify some of these genes and investigate their interactions with environmental factors. It will use a unique resource, the NHMRC Australian Twin Registry (ATR) to identify elderly twins, and will also include the siblings of these twins so as to increase the ability to identify the important factors. The participants, who are listed on the ATR and recruited from NSW, Queensland and Victoria, will receive detailed neurological, psychiatric and cognitive assessments, and will undergo brain MRI scans. Their blood samples will be used to measure key chemicals that may affect brain ageing and to extract DNA for genetic tests. They will be followed-up every two years thereafter, and changes in their brain structure and cognitive functioning will be examined. Available statistical models will be used to examine gene-environment interactions and specific genes will be explored for their contribution to the additive genetic effects. This study will yield an important resource for national and international collaborations and has the potential to discover new genes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Henry

older workers should work longer. But working longer involves changes to established policies, practices, and institutions, which are currently built around retiring earlier. The project will forecast demographic and health transition in Australia and develop capacity to analyze the likely economic and workplace adjustments that population ageing will generate. It will examine the extent to which ï¿½working longerï¿½ is an appropriate response to this transition, and analyze how the labour market for older workers might evolve, taking account of individual circumstances (health, financial status, dependant care) and institutional practices (age discrimination, employment conditions, work organization), as well as regulatory and policy impacts. The overall objective of the program is to develop a multi-disciplinary knowledge base to inform integrated policy and institutional (or practice) improvement in the labour market for the elderly. Its contribution will be to improve the institutional and policy framework within which households and firms operate, with the aim of modifying workplace practices and policy and institutional constraints to encourage a more vibrant labour market for older workers. Specifically the program of research will: Assess the demographic and economic impacts of working longer under alternative policy and institutional (practice) scenarios; Provide alternative pension, superannuation, finance and taxation designs to encourage labour force participation of older people; Identify employment strategies to enhance the health and safety of older workers; Develop strategies to facilitate workforce re-entry of older workers, including gender-specific considerations; and Provide an integrated set of recommendations to create policy and practice partnerships which facilitate a labour market conducive to increased mature-age participation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Mcdonald","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044144","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Mcdonald","source_individual_id":"5016327","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Mcdonald"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88436","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Piggott","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039092","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Piggott","source_individual_id":"5016980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Piggott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87133","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ching Choi","data":{"first_name":"Ching","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035862","middle_name":"Y","last_name":"Choi","source_individual_id":"5013910","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Ching Choi"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86289","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Bohle","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029519","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Bohle","source_individual_id":"5013531","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philip Bohle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84651","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Woodland","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028917","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Woodland","source_individual_id":"5018453","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alan Woodland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84495","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60523","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"AT2 receptor response in patients with impaired glucose metabolism and the effects of different therapies.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["AT2 receptor","Aterial stiffness indices","Endothelial dysfunctio","digital pulse contour analysis","impaired glucose metabolism"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401149,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"AT2 receptor response in patients with impaired glucose metabolism and the effects of different therapies.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Over the past 15 years, the Chief Investigators have established themselves as a leading international research group in child cancer and have successfully applied their laboratory-based discoveries to improve the clinical management of children with malignant diseases. In particular, key advances have been made in basic cell biology, molecular biology and in defining clinically relevant molecular targets and prognostic indicators for the child cancer, neuroblastoma, the commonest solid tumour in young children. These findings have been made possible by the team assembling, over recent years, an extensive and unique range of in vitro and in vivo model systems, together with a large bank of clinical neuroblastoma specimens. In this research program, the team members propose an experimental approach that will continue their studies, focussing on cancer initiation and better target identification within cancer cells, leading to the development of effective and non-toxic novel compounds, possibly prevention strategies,and introduction of novel therapies into clinical trial."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glenn Marshall","data":{"first_name":"Glenn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032350","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"Marshall","source_individual_id":"5012634","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Glenn Marshall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85375","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Murray Norris","data":{"first_name":"Murray","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027063","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Norris","source_individual_id":"RMIS147223","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Murray Norris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84000","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michelle Haber","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001974","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haber","source_individual_id":"RMIS147226","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michelle Haber"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77205","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60513","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Developing and disseminating effective treatments for depression and substance use comorbidity.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["comorbidity","depression","effectiveness","medical conditions","substance misuse"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401122,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Developing and disseminating effective treatments for depression and substance use comorbidity.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Frances Kay-Lambkin","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401122","simplified_title":"Developing and disseminating effective treatments for depression and substance use comorbidity.","sub_type":"Public Health (Australia) ECF","total_budget":"282008","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Frances Kay-Lambkin","data":{"first_name":"Frances","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0043426","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kay-Lambkin","source_individual_id":"RMIS681977","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Frances Kay-Lambkin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88255","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60511","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Redox reactions, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase and vascular disease.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["atherosclerosis","auto-immunity","tumour"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401113,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Redox reactions, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase and vascular disease.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

cancer, particularly when those changes are passed on to daughter cells. This has lead to massive research interest in the field of cancer genetics. In the last few years, it has become clear that as well as changes in DNA, other more subtle changes can be passed on. These changes, which do not directly involve changes in DNA sequence, are referred to as epigenetic changes. One of the most commonly recognised epigenetic changes is known as methylation. Methylation of genes can switch that gene off, meaning that the protein normally made is no longer present in the cell. This can have profound effects on the way cells behave, and importantly may be involved in the development of cancer. In this study, we will look at a group of colorectal cancers that show abnormally high amounts of DNA methylation , to test our hypothesis that these cancers share a common origin that is distinct from the usual type of bowel cancer. The findings will be important, as they may allow us to show that all bowel cancers are not the same, and that simple gene testing may be able to identify the different subtypes. If bowel cancers can be classified according to the way in which they have developed, then this will help us to understand what causes them why some are more aggressive than others, and why some may respond differently to existing or future cancer treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robyn Ward","data":{"first_name":"Robyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034577","middle_name":"Lynne","last_name":"Ward","source_individual_id":"5018206","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robyn Ward"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85960","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicholas Hawkins","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031189","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Hawkins","source_individual_id":"5015153","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Nicholas Hawkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85080","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60502","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Measuring adverse events: Development of a Patient-Centred Adverse Event Reporting Tool (PAET)","data":{"media_summary":"therapeutic effects","end_year":2008,"keywords":["clinical trial","health status","qualitative research","secondary adverse events","self report inventory"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401020,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["adverse treatment effects","clinical trials","drug safety","outcome assessment","therapeutic effects"],"scientific_title":"Measuring adverse events: Development of a Patient-Centred Adverse Event Reporting Tool (PAET)","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Marissa Lassere","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401020","simplified_title":"Measuring adverse events: Development of a Patient-Centred Adverse Event Reporting Tool (PAET)","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"454721.57","source_system":"The decision to treat a patient depends on knowing whether the treatment does more good than harm. If it is likely that the treatment will work as well as or better than other treatments and will have minimal associated risks, then that treatment would be recommended unless unavailable or prohibited by cost. Given two equally effective treatments the one with fewer side effects and greater tolerability would be preferred by all. In the process of acquiring knowledge on treatment benefit and treatment harm we rely on evidence from clinical trials. However, the evaluation of benefit versus harm is not symmetric in this setting. Much more effort (e.g. study design, study power, standardisation of efficacy outcome measures) goes into the assessment of whether a treatment works and rather than its potential harm, as measured by adverse events. Adverse event ascertainment and reporting is poorly standardised . There is no standardised measurement process that elicits adverse event information. There is no standardised method for quantifying adverse event information into an index or profile scores equivalent to instruments developed to measure health status, quality of life and other benefits of treatment. Developing astandardised Patient-centred Adverse Event Questionnaire will benefit multiple stakeholders. For Patients: An easy to understand summary measure of treatment harm aids patient understanding of the benefit versus risk. For Doctors, allied health professionals: The Questionnaire includes drug profiles, to align a drug profile with an individual patient's clinical profile. This leads to better patient care. In health policy: All of the above has flow-on effects for policy. Better adverse event data will facilitate information and understanding generally of risks of treatments, risk-benefits of treatments, and cost-effectiveness of management strategies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Tugwell","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040153","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tugwell","source_individual_id":"RMIS3160731","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Tugwell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87401","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicholas Bellamy","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035335","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bellamy","source_individual_id":"RMIS3691361","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicholas Bellamy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86158","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Day","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030298","middle_name":"Osborne","last_name":"Day","source_individual_id":"RMIS4228","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Day"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84857","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marissa Lassere","data":{"first_name":"Marissa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014366","middle_name":"Nichole","last_name":"Lassere","source_individual_id":"5012483","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Marissa Lassere"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80580","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kent Johnson","data":{"first_name":"Kent","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013972","middle_name":"","last_name":"Johnson","source_individual_id":"5018357","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Kent Johnson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80472","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rick Iedema","data":{"first_name":"Rick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008077","middle_name":"Aren","last_name":"Iedema","source_individual_id":"RMIS3785667","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rick Iedema"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78884","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60501","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Control of CD4 Function by Disulphide-Bond Switching","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["HIV/AIDS","biochemistry","disulphide-bond","domain swapping","protein chemistry"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400989,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["HIV/AIDS","immunology","infection"],"scientific_title":"Control of CD4 Function by Disulphide-Bond Switching","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Philip Hogg","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400989","simplified_title":"Control of Immune Function and HIV Infection by Disulphide-Bond Switching","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"252761.74","source_system":"CD4 is a cell-surface protein that has two functions in the human body, a good one and a bad one. Its good function is as a checkpoint for development of the immune system and for response of the immune system to infection. It helps immune cells known as T cells to recognize and dispose of a foreign particle in the body. Its bad function is that it is one of two proteins that enable the HIV virus to enter and destroy immune cells. The HIV virus binds to CD4 on immune cells, which leads to fusion of the viral and immune cell surfaces and entry of the virus into the cell. Once inside the immune cell the virus reproduces itself and goes on to kill more immune cells. AIDS results when too many immune cells are killed. We have discovered that CD4 exists in three different forms on the immune cell surface; an oxidized, reduced or dimeric form. These different forms result from a molecular switch we discovered in CD4. We have suggested that the good and bad functions of CD4 are mediated by different forms of CD4. The good function is mediated by dimeric CD4, while the bad function is mediated by reduced CD4. The purpose of this application is to test this hypothesis. If we are correct then our findings will have significant implications for our understanding of how the immune system responds to a foreign invader and how HIV-AIDS destroys the immune system. This knowledge could be used to develop drugs that suppress the immune system when required, such as in organ transplantation, and that fight HIV-AIDS."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Akiko Maekawa","data":{"first_name":"Akiko","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0008836","middle_name":"","last_name":"Maekawa","source_individual_id":"RMIS3799750","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Akiko Maekawa"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79092","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Hogg","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002233","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hogg","source_individual_id":"5012741","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philip Hogg"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77286","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60499","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gene Expression and DNA Methylation in Barrett's Oesophagus and Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Barrett's oesophagus","Cancer detection","Cancer pharmacogenetics","Gene therapy","Oesophageal adenocarcinoma"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400985,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Barrett's oesophagus","Gastroesophageal reflux disease","Oesophageal adenocarcinoma"],"scientific_title":"Gene Expression and DNA Methylation in Barrett's Oesophagus and Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Surgery","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Reginald Lord","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400985","simplified_title":"How Barrett's oesophagus leads to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and how this information might improve clinical care.","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"383655.9","source_system":"The oesophagus (gullet) is the tube through which food and drinks pass from the mouth to the stomach. In Barrett's oesophagus, the normal lining of the lower oesophagus is replaced by an abnormal type of lining called intestinal metaplasia as a result of severe gastroesophageal reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux is one of the most common of all diseases, affecting up to a quarter of all adults, and Barrett's oesophagus itself occurs in 0.5 - 1% of the adult population. In a minority of patients with Barrett's oesophagus, further abnormalities in the cells lining the lower oesophagus occur, leading to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma (glandular cell type cancer). This project will provide the first comprehensive map of two of the most important genetic mechanisms (gene expression and DNA methylation) by which Barrett's oesophagus evolves into Barrett's dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The specimens studied in this project differ from previous studies in that they are taken from the same patients at different times, as these patients' Barrett's oesophagus either remains stable or progresses to worse disease. Essentially all the known human genes will be studied and the relevance of genes identified as important will be confirmed using highly accurate methods. With this information, it may be possible to develop genetic tests that can predict which patients are at risk of developing worse disease including cancer. In other parts of this project, genes which influence the likelihood of survival for patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma will be identified, a simple test to more accurately identify patients with cancer spread to lymph nodes may be developed, and a blood test to detect oesophageal adenocarcinoma will be tested."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Reginald Lord","data":{"first_name":"Reginald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014543","middle_name":"V N","last_name":"Lord","source_individual_id":"5016066","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Reginald Lord"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80634","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60498","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Rane and Spain routes in the brain: functional studies and remediation in dyslexia subtypes.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Reading","functional magnetic resonance imaging","language impairment","magnetic resonance spectroscopy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400955,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["deep dyslexia","language impairment","surface dyslexia"],"scientific_title":"The Rane and Spain routes in the brain: functional studies and remediation in dyslexia subtypes.","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Rae","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400955","simplified_title":"Function and remediation in dyslexia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"374426.08","source_system":"According to a recent DEST report a disturbingly high number of Australian school children are failing to meet a minimum acceptable standard in literacy . Failure to reach these standards is associated with poorer outcomes in mental health and socioeconomic status, greater representation among the prison population and with failure to achieve to true ability. Further, failure to correct these problems may well result in transmission of the problems associated with failed literacy into the next generation. Despite the obvious immense social and personal ramifications and cost, literacy instruction for adults continues to lack a theoretical and research based approach . It is plain that improving population literacy would have significant benefits and it is also plain that early detection, intervention and remediation is desirable. This project brings to bear on these important aims current expertise in the nature of reading, how children learn to read and why some have so much difficulty in doing so, and techniques for determining the neural substrates of the mechanisms involved in reading and learning to read.

We will use magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to examine which parts of the brain are disrupted and-or disconnected when ability to read in either of these two routes is poor.

These disorders of pain sensation due to nerve injury are common, debilitating and difficult to treat. They are symptoms of neuropathic pain. Pain is normally signalled to the brain by sensory nerve cells called nociceptors. Following nerve injury, nociceptors are sensitised by chemicals released by inflammatory cells. This contributes to neuropathic pain. We have evidence that inflammatory responses play a key role in initiating neuropathic pain. Other evidence suggests that the immune system contributes to neurological diseases and accompanying pain (e.g. Guillain-Barr syndrome and multiple sclerosis). We plan to test the idea that a component of the immune system known as the complement pathway contributes to the development of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. The outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the way in which nerve injury leads to chronic disorders of pain, including increased sensitivity to painful stimuli. This will lead in turn to the development of more effective treatments for neuropathic pain."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"David Tracey","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0040115","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tracey","source_individual_id":"RMIS109976","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David Tracey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87391","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Gila Moalem-Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Gila","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003440","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moalem-Taylor","source_individual_id":"5016509","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Gila Moalem-Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77618","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60495","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The interaction between sexually transmissible infections and human immunodeficiency virus infection in homosexual men","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["HIV/AIDS","behavioural epidemiology","prevention","sexually transmitted infections"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400944,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["HIV and sexually transmitted diseases","disease prevention","epidemiology","sexually transmitted infection"],"scientific_title":"The interaction between sexually transmissible infections and human immunodeficiency virus infection in homosexual men","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew Grulich","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400944","simplified_title":"Do sexually transmitted infections increase the risk of HIV infection?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"635931.8","source_system":"This project examines the inter-relationship between HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in homosexual men.

Homosexual men comprise over 80% of people diagnosed with HIV infecton in Australia, and in many developed nations are one of the largest groups affected by HIV. Rates of other STIs are also increased in homosexual men. Currently, HIV rates are increasing in Australia and in many developed countries. We are in need of new and effective methods of HIV prevention. Data in heterosexuals suggest that where STIs are common, the early detection and treatment of these infections may help reduce HIV incidence. There are few data on this relationship in homosexual men. We propose to utilise an existing Sydney cohort of homosexual men to collect data on biologic tests for STIs, history of recent diagnosis of STIs, and symptoms, to allow a comprehensive description of the epidemiology of STIs and their overlap with HIV. The quality of data on the interaction between HIV and STIs in this cohort will be superior to any previously collected in homosexual men, as it will include data on self-reported doctor diagnosed illness, state of the art biologic testing, and symptom data, for the full spectrum of important STIs. The results of this study will be helpful in determining strategies for HIV and STI screening, education and control in the population which comprises the great majority of cases of HIV infection in Australia, and one of the largest risk groups for HIV infection in the developed world. Screening coupled with treatment of asymptomatic STIs may be an effective new approach to HIV prevention in this population."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Garrett Prestage","data":{"first_name":"Garrett","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044913","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Prestage","source_individual_id":"5017043","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Garrett Prestage"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88625","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Grulich","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025215","middle_name":"Edwin","last_name":"Grulich","source_individual_id":"5014967","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Grulich"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83488","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Susan Kippax","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020128","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Kippax","source_individual_id":"RMIS1791488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Susan Kippax"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82139","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Kaldor","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008271","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Kaldor","source_individual_id":"5013050","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Kaldor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78930","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Basil Donovan","data":{"first_name":"Basil","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001330","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Donovan","source_individual_id":"5014375","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Basil Donovan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77045","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60494","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Understanding fear of falling and risk taking in older people","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Accidental falls","Aged care","Cognitive behaviour","Fear of falling","Physical impairment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400941,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Accidental falls among older people","Disability","Fear of falling","Injury control and prevention"],"scientific_title":"Understanding fear of falling and risk taking in older people","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Stephen Lord","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400941","simplified_title":"Understanding fear of falling and risk taking in older people","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"355877.93","source_system":"Fear of falling is a very significant issue for many older people.

To date, all studies addressing fear of falling have simply considered no fear to be good and presence of fear to be bad, and have not attempted to assess whether this fear is rational or irrational in relation to actual balance abilities or physical functioning. In this study, we aim to find out which psychological, physical, health and lifestyle factors distinguish between older people with and without an irrational fear of falling based on their actual physical falling risk. We also wish to understand the role that fear of falling and other psychological factors (anxiety, depression and avoidance) play in causing older people to fall; and to measure how falls can lead to increased fear of falling, anxiety and depression and reduced physical functioning. The complex nature of psychological risk factors of falling and the limited background information on this subject, hampers its integration in falls prevention programs.

Oxaliplatin therapy results in disabling neurological effects. Onset of neuropathy can be relatively fast or in other cases may develop months after therapy has been completed. The other chief problems encountered during chemotherapy can be overcome: nausea and vomiting can be treated; myelosuppression can be reversed.

Equally importantly, some damaged nerve cells die over the months that follow an injury. This slow loss of nerve cells can lead to progressive and ongoing deterioration. Given recent advances in our understanding of how to improve axon regeneration, the degree of functional recovery could be disappointing unless we know more about how to prevent these neurones from dying. This project will use rats as experimental animals to try to understand which types of nerve cells are likely to die or survive after injury to peripheral nerve trunks or to the spinal cord. We will investigate two regions of the nervous system that are commonly involved in injuries in people. After injuries to limb nerves, people lose sensation and movement and can unpredictably develop chronic conditions such as neuropathic pain (unrelated to the damage and often occurring spontaneously) as well as poor blood flow and wound healing in the hands-feet. After most injuries to the spinal cord, the lower part of the cord beyond the injury (in particular the lumbosacral cord controlling hindlimb movement and sensation and the function of bladder, bowel and sexual organs) is often disconnected from the brain leading to paralysis and disrupted control of pelvic organ function. We will identify and study specific populations of nerve cells with sensory (mainly pain-sensing) functions and four identified groups of nerve cells in the lumbosacral cord that project to the brain. Once we know which nerve cells do not survive, we will search for the likely causes of their death and ways to prevent it."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Elspeth Mclachlan","data":{"first_name":"Elspeth","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044182","middle_name":"Mary","last_name":"Mclachlan","source_individual_id":"RMIS109979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Elspeth Mclachlan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88452","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60487","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial of Nurse and General Practitioner partnership for care of COPD","data":{"media_summary":"5) Health Outcomes","end_year":2008,"keywords":["1) Primary Health Care","2) Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD)","3) Clinical Practice Guidelines","4) Community Intervention Study","5) Health Outcomes"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400915,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["1) Primary Health Care","2) Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD)","3) Clinical Patient Management","4) Clinical Guidelines","5) Health Outcomes"],"scientific_title":"A Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial of Nurse and General Practitioner partnership for care of COPD","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Nicholas Zwar","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400915","simplified_title":"A Randomised Trial of Nurse and General Practitioner partnership for care of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","sub_type":"Primary Health Care Project Grant","total_budget":"449377.12","source_system":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic disease that can progress to severe disability and use of hospital services.

National evidence based guidelines for management of COPD were published in 2003 but these need to be implemented in the community. General practice is well placed to have a key role in early intervention and evidence based management of COPD. There is evidence that specialised nurses working in collaboration with GPs can improve the care the chronic illnesses including COPD. Care Plans with input from health professionals from a range of disciplines have been recommended for COPD but there are barriers to implementing these in general practice. This project brings together nurse assistance and care planning in a model of care designed to deliver best practice management of COPD in the community. The aim of this research is to evaluate the impact of anurse and GP partnership for care of COPD. We will examine the effect on quality of care and health outcomes at 6 and 12 months follow up. Our hypothesis is that the use of a nurse to work as a team with the patient and GP to develop and implement a care plan based on clinical practice guidelines will improve the quality of care received and have a beneficial effect on the patients' respiratory and overall health.

While a comparatively modest cell death occurs in other areas of the brain in Parkinson's disease, the motor symptoms result from the massive death of particular brain cells which are unique in that they contain a pigment called neuromelanin. This project aims to discover what makes the neuromelanin-containing cells of the brain particularly vulnerable to cell death in Parkinson's disease. We recently found that neuromelanin pigment in the cells of people who have died with Parkinson's disease concentrate a fat-binding protein called alpha-synuclein which is thought to be important in causing cell death in Parkinson's disease. This association between the neuromelanin pigment and alpha-synuclein was not found in other cells in Parkinson brain which do not contain pigment, nor in the brains of healthy people. We also found that a third of neuromelanin is made up of a special group of fats called isoprenoids. Changes in these fats have already been reported in the blood in Parkinson's disease. We suggest that specific changes in the isoprenoid fats in neuromelanin in Parkinson's disease cause alpha-synuclein protein to accumulate on the fat in the pigment, as well as other cellular changes which are detrimental to the cell, ultimately leading to the death of the cell. These changes may explain for the first time why neuromelanin-containing brain cells are especially vulnerable in Parkinson's disease and provide new avenues for treating this disorder."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Kay Double","data":{"first_name":"Kay","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024584","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Double","source_individual_id":"5014402","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Kay Double"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83307","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glenda Halliday","data":{"first_name":"Glenda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019412","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Halliday","source_individual_id":"RMIS4337831","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Glenda Halliday"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81939","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brett Garner","data":{"first_name":"Brett","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013170","middle_name":"","last_name":"Garner","source_individual_id":"5014767","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Brett Garner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80256","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60485","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"NPY suppresses seizures and modulates thalamocortical activity in animal models of generalized epilepsy","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Epilepsy","Neuropeptide Y","Neurophysiology","Pharmacology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":400106,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Absence seizures","Generalised epilepsy","Nervous system disorders"],"scientific_title":"NPY suppresses seizures and modulates thalamocortical activity in animal models of generalized epilepsy","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Margaret Morris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400106","simplified_title":"Neuropeptide Y and absence seizures","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"386020.54","source_system":"Epilepsy is the most common serious chronic neurological disease in the community, affecting up to 3% of the population in a lifetime and 0.5-1% at any one time. Absence epilepsy is one of the most common types of epilepsy, most frequently seen in childhood and teenage years that may persist into adulthood. Anti-epileptic drugs are effective in controlling absence seizures in most patients, however there is an important group (20-40%) of patients in whom the absence seizures remain uncontrolled with current medications. Recently there has been considerable interest in the role that chemical in the brain, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), may play in epilepsy. The research proposed will examine the role of NPY in several animal models of absence epilepsy. We have recently shown that NPY suppresses absence seizures in a rat genetic model of generalised epilepsy, and that this appears to be mediated by Y2 receptors. This work will build on these novel findings, and determine the localisation of the effect within the brain, and the underlying mechanism. We will check NPY effects across several models in different species, a genetic rat model with spontaneous seizures, and in mice treated with a chemical to induce seizures. This will determine its broad applicability. We will also determine the effects of removal of NPY or NPY receptors on the effects of NPY on seizure expression. Finally, brain recording techniques will be applied to determine the mechanism and site within the brain underlying the protective actions of NPY. The project has the potential to provide novel insights into the role of NPY in the expression and modulation of absence seizures. NPY related mechanisms might represent targets for the development of a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of absence epilepsy. Targets that are identified as being important in the expression of absence seizures may also prove to be relevant in other types of generalised epilepsy syndromes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Terence O'Brien","data":{"first_name":"Terence","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044589","middle_name":"J","last_name":"O'Brien","source_individual_id":"5011218","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Terence O'Brien"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88542","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christopher Reid","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009862","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Reid","source_individual_id":"RMIS1569275","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Christopher Reid"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79379","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Margaret Morris","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009227","middle_name":"Joan","last_name":"Morris","source_individual_id":"5016557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Margaret Morris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79210","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60372","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Responding to illicit drugs in Australia: towards evidence-based strategic policy.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["drug policy","illicit drug markets","pharmacotherapies","translational research"],"nhmrc_grant_id":398505,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Responding to illicit drugs in Australia: towards evidence-based strategic policy.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Alison Ritter","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/398505","simplified_title":"Responding to illicit drugs in Australia: towards evidence-based strategic policy.","sub_type":"Population Health CDF","total_budget":"462290","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alison Ritter","data":{"first_name":"Alison","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039345","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ritter","source_individual_id":"RMIS3485","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alison Ritter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87200","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60296","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The biological role of the cadherin gene FAT in bipolar disorder susceptibility","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["bipolar affective disorder","cadherin","molecular neuroscience","susceptibility gene"],"nhmrc_grant_id":376011,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["aetiology for neuropsychiatric disorders","bipolar affective disorder","mood disorder"],"scientific_title":"The biological role of the cadherin gene FAT in bipolar disorder susceptibility","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Peter Schofield","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/376011","simplified_title":"Investigating the biology of a bipolar disorder susceptibility gene","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"509491.48","source_system":"Bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness) is a severe mood disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 1%. The illness is characterised by aberrant mood swings resulting in periods of mania and depression with reversion to normal behaviour between episodes. The condition has a severe impact on sufferers, being demonstrated to be the sixth most disabling disorder in the WHO Global Burden of Disease report and increasing the risk of suicide fifteen-fold. There is a pressing need to define more clearly the biological basis of bipolar disorder as a necessary prerequisite to improved diagnosis and treatment. The underlying causes of bipolar disorder remain unknown. However, family studies reveal the high heritability of bipolar disorder and this familial clustering provides an opportunity to use genetic approaches to identify the predisposing genes. The long-term aim of our research is to investigate the biology of those genes that either cause or predispose to bipolar disorder. We have previously used genetic approaches to identify the first bipolar disorder susceptibility gene, a cell contact molecule located on chromosome 4 that is from the cadherin family. The aim of this proposal is to understand how this gene contributes to the risk of developing bipolar disorder. This will be achieved by identifying how the cadherin susceptibility gene, termed 'FAT' results in altered properties in laboratory assays or in altered behaviours in animal models. Identifying the genes responsible for bipolar disorder and understanding their contribution to the biological basis of this severe psychiatric condition is essential to translate these discoveries into improvements in the ability to diagnose, treat and prevent the illness."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ian

We focus on the components of the cell skeleton (cytoskeleton) which are implicated in the regulation of shape. In particular, we study the actin based microfilament system. We have previously shown that two types of these components of the cytoskeleton are able to control the structure of cells. In addition, we have found that variants of these two components (called isoforms) are used to build structures in different parts of cells. This has led us to think about the anatomy of cells and tissues in a new way. In some ways its like building a city. You create different kinds of buildings to suit their purpose. Each building uses a combination of building blocks which suit the structural demands of rooms and the overall building. In this study we are proposing to identify the specific job that one of these types of building blocks must play in order to allow normal cell growth and embryo development. To do this, we plan to change these genes in mice and then examine the impact on cell and tissue anatomy. This promises to contribute to the conversion of anatomical science and pathology from descriptive to experimental-mechanistic disciplines. This in turn will lead to a new tool set of diagnostic agents for the pathologist and the development of drugs which target specific functions of the cytoskeleton."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Galina Schevzov","data":{"first_name":"Galina","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021972","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schevzov","source_individual_id":"5017385","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Galina Schevzov"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Gunning","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013397","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Gunning","source_individual_id":"5015010","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Gunning"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80321","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6460","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Health Impact of Prostitution Laws.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Access to health care.","Health promotion","Legal issues.","Sexually transmitted infections.","Social determinants of health."],"nhmrc_grant_id":352437,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Laws and policing","Prostitution","Public health outcomes"],"scientific_title":"The Health Impact of Prostitution Laws.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Basil Donovan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/352437","simplified_title":"The Health Impact of Prostitution Laws.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"555600","source_system":"Overall Australia provides an ideal environment for research into the public health effects of prostitution laws.

There is currently no standard treatment for AMD. A safe, specific and effective pharmacologic agent for AMD, therefore, has enormous therapeutic, social and economic benefits. AMD is underpinned by vascular leakiness and new blood vessel formation. We have demonstrated that Egr-1, a nuclear transcription factor, plays a key regulatory role in a diverse array of angiogenic processes. In this project, we will use novel gene-targeting agents (Egr-1 siRNA) to provide preclinical proof-of principle evidence of their therapeutic potential in established animal models of AMD. These studies will pre-empt Phase IA safety trials in AMD patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Levon Khachigian","data":{"first_name":"Levon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020094","middle_name":"Michael","last_name":"Khachigian","source_individual_id":"RMIS227494","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Levon Khachigian"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82125","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6324","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Psychosocial aspects of genetic testing and counselling","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Genetic testing","Human genome"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350989,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Psychosocial aspects of genetic testing and counselling","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetics not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Bettina Meiser","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350989","simplified_title":"Psychosocial aspects of genetic testing and counselling","sub_type":"Population Health CDF","total_budget":"503500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Bettina Meiser","data":{"first_name":"Bettina","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003364","middle_name":"","last_name":"Meiser","source_individual_id":"5016434","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Bettina Meiser"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77592","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6322","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Lipid raft organisation in mammalian cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Lipid raft"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350986,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Lipid raft organisation in mammalian cells","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Katharina Gaus","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350986","simplified_title":"Lipid raft organisation in mammalian cells","sub_type":"Partnership CDF","total_budget":"359250","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Katharina Gaus","data":{"first_name":"Katharina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036795","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gaus","source_individual_id":"5014795","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Katharina Gaus"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86529","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6321","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Longitudinal treatment outcomes for methamphetamine dependence: a treatment cohort study","data":{"media_summary":"Stimulant use","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Drug treatment","Longitudinal cohort study","Methamphetamine dependence","Natural history","Psychiatric morbidity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350974,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Anxiety","Depression","Drug dependence","Psychosis","Stimulant use"],"scientific_title":"Longitudinal treatment outcomes for methamphetamine dependence: a treatment cohort study","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Richard Mattick","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350974","simplified_title":"Methamphetamine treatment cohort study","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"720500","source_system":"Australia has a substantial and growing population of problematic stimulant users, namely dependent or injecting methamphetamine users, with methamphetamine injection accounting for one-third of all injecting drug use.

Increasing numbers of people are presenting for treatment of methamphetamine dependence and many are experiencing other psychiatric problems like drug-induced psychosis and depression. Currently little is known about people who present for treatment of methamphetamine dependence, including how many have other serious mental health problems that need treatment in their own right. Nor is it known whether the treatment they receive for their methamphetamine use is effective in reducing their drug use or improving their mental health status. The current study will provide much needed information on people seeking treatment for methamphetamine dependence in Australia, including their psychiatric status, and whether the treatment they receive for methamphetamine dependence is effective in reducing their drug use and related health problems or improving their mental health status. These aims will be met by assessing drug use, psychiatric status, treatment experience as well as general health and well being among a cohort of people entering treatment for methamphetamine use in Sydney. Responses to treatment will be assessed at 3 months and 12 months following treatment entry and outcomes will be compared to a group of methamphetamine users not receiving treatment.

The most effective long-term psychological treatment for anxiety disorders is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), in particular exposure therapy. However only a small minority of individuals receive comprehensive treatment, and a portion of these individuals re-experience symptoms in the long-term. These difficulties are partially due to the cost of treatment and difficulties with relapse. Recent research has shown that D-Cycloserine (DCS) facilitates extinction in animals and possibly in humans. DCS has the potential to offer a simple, brief, and cost-effective intervention that enhances treatment effects. In the United States the new NIMH director has set research into DCS and exposure to fear as a high priority that is likely to have a significant public health impact. This proposal provides an opportunity for Australian researchers to become involved in a rapidly expanding research field. The research team at UNSW have already established an international reputation in DCS applications, fear conditioning in humans, and clinical trials in humans. They are in a unique position internationally to investigate the means by which DCS exerts its effects and to conduct randomised clinical trials of DCS in recovery from fear in humans.The goal is to test DCS in facilitating exposure and extinction of fear. The research will directly lead to recommendations for clinical application and demonstrate whether the drug has the capability of significantly increasing the success of exposure therapy by reducing the time required for treatment, the rate of relapse, the financial cost of treatment, and the overall burden of anxiety to the community. The fear-conditioning studies will also inform our theoretical understanding of emotion processing and fear conditioning in humans, which in turn will allow clinical applications to be optimised."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Adam Guastella","data":{"first_name":"Adam","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019366","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Guastella","source_individual_id":"5012417","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Adam Guastella"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81929","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Dadds","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012594","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Dadds","source_individual_id":"RMIS96625","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Dadds"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80114","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rick Richardson","data":{"first_name":"Rick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004231","middle_name":"","last_name":"Richardson","source_individual_id":"RMIS69839","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rick Richardson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77849","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Lovibond","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003043","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Lovibond","source_individual_id":"RMIS154786","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Lovibond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77512","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6319","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Early Events in Arteriolar Remodeling: Adaptation to Prolonged Vasoconstriction","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["arteriolar remodeling","isolated arterioles","matrix-vascular cell interactions","microcirculation","vascular smooth muscle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350961,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["hypertension","peripheral vascular disorders","vascular remodeling"],"scientific_title":"Early Events in Arteriolar Remodeling: Adaptation to Prolonged Vasoconstriction","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Michael Hill","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350961","simplified_title":"Adaptive Behaviour of the Arteriolar Wall","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"415750","source_system":"Small arteries, while acutely responding to their environment with changes in diameter to regulate local blood flow and pressure, also undergo structural adaptation or remodelling. These events occur over a range of time-frames and involve both non-genetically and genetically regulated events. Thus a contractile event, while initially decreasing vessel diameter, also activates longer time frame processes which can span from rearrangment of cellular junctions-contacts to overt structural changes within the vessel wall (for example thickening of the muscle layer). These adaptive processes may enable the forces of contraction to be maintained without continued energy expenditure and damage to the vessel per se. However, they can also contribute to long-term alterations in the control of blood pressure and perhaps contribute to states of hypertension as well as other common vascular diseases. For these studies we will use arterioles, isolated by microsurgical techniques, together with sophisticated computer and video-based approaches. These techniques allow arterioles to be studied under controlled conditions and relevant biochemical measurements performed. We will also use a cell model where cultured cells will be studied after defined periods of mechanical stimulation (for example stretch). Cells will be probed using a novel microscopic technique (atomic force microscopy) which enables the cell membrane to be studied with respect to changes in composition as well as physical characteristics (for example stiffness). The studies are relevant to our understanding of the normal adaptive processes occurring within blood vessels to control blood flow and pressure. The studies are also of direct relevance to our understanding of common vascular disease states including hypertension, complications of diabetes and chronic inflammatory disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Hill","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031312","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Hill","source_individual_id":"RMIS129337","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Hill"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85106","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michelle Gee","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025025","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Gee","source_individual_id":"RMIS7026691","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michelle Gee"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83437","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6318","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Trial of structured support to enhance the role of non-GP staff in chronic disease management in general practice","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["chronic illness","general practice","non-GP practice staff (nurses, managers, receptionists)","quality of care"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350931,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Diabetes (type 2)","Hypertension","Ischaemic heart disease"],"scientific_title":"Trial of structured support to enhance the role of non-GP staff in chronic disease management in general practice","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Mark Harris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350931","simplified_title":"The role of non-GP staff in chronic disease management in general practice","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"780625","source_system":"Chronic disease presents a significant burden to individuals and the health care system , contributing to both an increasing proportion of the work of primary health care practitioners and to health expenditure.

While some of these approaches have been pursued within the Coordinated Care Trials and the Enhanced Primary Care (EPC) program in Australia, the role of non medical staff within general practice in chronic disease care has not been systematically investigated. In 2001 the Commonwealth introduced a number of initiatives to support better quality of care for diabetes and asthma in general practice and $104.2 million over four years was provided for general practices in areas of high workforce pressure to employ more Nurses. The roles of the Practice Manager and Receptionist have received much less attention. They include faclitating access to care, supporting the delivery of quality clinical care by the practitioners through the provision of expert management services (primarily information technology, staff, financial and facilities management) to the practice. With recent government initiatives expanding the role of general practice in Australia, effective management structures and processes within general practices are vital. Non-GP general practice staff may be the means by which more effective chronic disease management can be achieved at a time of increasing workforce pressure.

We have generated considerable laboratory based data that these ocular surface disorders may be triggered by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and this fits well with the extensive epidemiological evidence. To data the only form of treatment is surgical intervention, often with adjunctive topical agents that can cause other more severe complication of the eye. The aim of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of agents such as retinoic acid and interferons to block or inhibit the down-stream effects of UV radiation. Currently, we have preliminary data that suggests these agents can significantly reduce several molecules that are activated by UV in cultured ocular surface cells. Furthermore, we have clinical evidence that retinoic acid and interferon can resolve both pterygia and conjunctival dysplasia in a small group of patients.

Atherosclerosis involves the accumulation of lipid-laden cells in the wall of arteries that generates plaques resulting in a decrease in the lumen of the affected vessel that can impede or block blood flow resulting in clinical complications. The cellular events involved in atherosclerosis are complex. However, increasing information indicates that atherosclerosis involves an inappropriate response of the immune and inflammatory systems. This proposal plans to investigate the role of a protein, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that is increased during inflammation and is important for the regulation of the host's immune system. We propose that increasing IDO activity in inflammatory cells will attenuate the degree of vascular disease by decreasing the overall level of immune activation and inflammation in the blood vessels. We will test this by modulating the expression and activity of this protein in animal models of vascular disease, measure the extent of disease and then elucidate the mechanisms by which the protein acts. The significance of these studies is that they will provide useful information on the inflammatory and immune processes involved in the progression of atherosclerosis and may identify a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Shane Thomas","data":{"first_name":"Shane","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028366","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Thomas","source_individual_id":"5017913","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Shane Thomas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84335","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6315","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Germline epimutations of tumour suppressor genes in familial cancer","data":{"media_summary":"Inherited cancer","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Clinical research","Colorectal cancer","DNA methylation","Epigenetics","Genetic testing"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350911,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Clusterings of colorectal cancer in families","Endometrial cancer","Familial adenomatous polyposis","Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer","Inherited cancer"],"scientific_title":"Germline epimutations of tumour suppressor genes in familial cancer","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Genetics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Robyn WARD","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350911","simplified_title":"Epimutations - a new cause for hereditary cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"502500","source_system":"In the case of bowel cancer, studies of the pattern of disease in our community indicate that up to 20% of all bowel cancers has a inherited component . We now know the genetic abnormality in up to 4% of these cases. We have recently discovered a previously unrecognised cause of cancer. Individuals who are affected by this disease may have cancer in the bowel, as well as the breast and womb. In this condition the gene alphabet is correct but the genes are chemically modified. This change called methylation means that certain genes are spelt incorrectly or not at all. To date we have found two individuals who have this problem. Our work has shown that these individuals have inherited a genetic change and potentially could pass this change on to their offspring. This grant application seeks to formally pursue this findng. We will study a group of people in whom the genetic cause for their cancer remains unknown. Blood samples from these individuals will be examined for methylation of their DNA. A successful project will lead to a full description of this new type of hereditary cancer, and thus serve as the basis for identifying and effectively managing people and families at risk of this disease. It is likely that identification of individuals who are 'at risk' of cancer will allow us to implement preventative screening strategies. We will also be able to provide reassurance to those family members who have not inherited the methylation abnormality."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robyn Ward","data":{"first_name":"Robyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034577","middle_name":"Lynne","last_name":"Ward","source_individual_id":"5018206","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robyn Ward"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85960","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"David Martin","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0026530","middle_name":"","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS85740","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83859","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6314","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Genetic polymorphisms in genes controlling innate immunity as risk factors for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Cancer epidemiology","Child health","Environmental risk factors","Genetic polymorphisms"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350908,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","Cancer","Childhood malignancy","Genetic susceptibility"],"scientific_title":"Genetic polymorphisms in genes controlling innate immunity as risk factors for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Lesley Ashton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350908","simplified_title":"Genes influencing immunity during early childhood: a potential causal role in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"241500","source_system":"For some time now, researchers have speculated that the development of childhood leukaemia is related to exposure to an infectious agent. However, a causal pathogen is yet to be identified. Recent studies have shown that the initial recognition of microbes as they enter the human body is determined by a group of receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), which selectively bind to essential components of these pathogens. This process allows the body to respond immediately to microbial invasion; a process which is vital during early childhood, when clonal expansion of antibodies and other host defences is inadequate. It is becoming increasingly apparent that this innate immune response is not just the first line of defence but a necessary event for the development of an adaptive immune response. We propose that the innate immune system of children carrying TLR gene variants may be less effective at detecting the presence of microbial pathogens in the environment. We hypothesize that by dampening the stimulation of innate immunity in early childhood, TLR gene variants may indirectly cause a dysfunction in the maturation of a child's immune system and increase the chance of a pre-leukaemic clone emerging, leading to the development of childhood leukaemia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lesley Ashton","data":{"first_name":"Lesley","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035160","middle_name":"Jayne","last_name":"Ashton","source_individual_id":"RMIS1159420","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lesley Ashton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86118","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lyle Palmer","data":{"first_name":"Lyle","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027194","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Palmer","source_individual_id":"5012502","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Lyle Palmer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84027","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bruce Armstrong","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017487","middle_name":"Konrad","last_name":"Armstrong","source_individual_id":"RMIS68379","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bruce Armstrong"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81464","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Milne","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009146","middle_name":"","last_name":"Milne","source_individual_id":"RMIS105598","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Milne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79184","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6313","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms underlying disordered skin blood flow following nerve injury","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["denervation/reinnervation of blood vessels","peptidergic vasodilation","sensory/sympathetic interaction","smooth muscle contraction","vascular reactivity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350903,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["diabetes","neuropathic pain","peripheral nerve injury","peripheral vascular disease"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms underlying disordered skin blood flow following nerve injury","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Peripheral Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr James Brock","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350903","simplified_title":"How nerve injury and disease produce skin problems in the extremities","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"408000","source_system":"Many people who recover from traumatic injury or who have chronic conditions such as diabetes or neuropathy from exposure to a toxic chemical suffer from peripheral vascular disorders leading to poor circulation in the extremities. These conditions are characterised by impaired wound healing, cold hands and feet and ongoing pain. These people must face a long life with progressively increasing disability. Even normal ageing can lead to similar problems. This project is directed at understanding the role of the nerve supply to blood vessels in the skin in these disorders. The experiments will be conducted in skin blood vessels of rats with various forms of nerve lesion that will mimic these conditions in patients. We will use our knowledge of the structure and behaviour of nerve-blood vessel connections to analyse the changes in the properties of vascular smooth muscle and relate it to the state of the innervation. Skin arteries normally receive two types of nerve - sympathetic (which release noradrenaline) and afferent ( which release peptides) - that have opposing actions on the vessel (constriction and dilation respectively). We hypothesize that removal of part or all of the innervation changes the contractile mechanism of the smooth muscle in the wall of the vessel so that it becomes much more sensitive to calcium ions and produces larger and more prolonged contractions. We will combine electrophysiology and contraction studies with immunohistochemistry and biochemical analysis to define the relation between the nerve deficit and the vascular responses. The aim is to identify appropriate drug targets for which local application in the affected region can alleviate the symptoms without causing widespread side effects."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Elspeth Mclachlan","data":{"first_name":"Elspeth","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044182","middle_name":"Mary","last_name":"Mclachlan","source_individual_id":"RMIS109979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Elspeth Mclachlan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88452","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr James Brock","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023792","middle_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Brock","source_individual_id":"5013635","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr James Brock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83112","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6311","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of Novel Antimicrobial Agents","data":{"media_summary":"Therapeutic agents","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Adhesion mechanisms","Antibotics","Bacterial pathogen","Immune response"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350900,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Bacterial Infections","Bacterial pathogenicity","Drug discovery","Inhibition of Virulence","Therapeutic agents"],"scientific_title":"Development of Novel Antimicrobial Agents","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Staffan Kjelleberg","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350900","simplified_title":"Development of Novel Antimicrobial Agents","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"469500","source_system":"The Team brings together a unique grouping of people with backgrounds in molecular biology, medical microbiology, microbiology, marine ecology and immunology to tackle a significant health problem infections caused by bacteria.

Evidence obtained by ourselves and others, suggests that early detection of poor treatment response in the otherwise good prognosis group, and the implementation of alternative therapy when the cancer burden is at a low level, has a high likelihood of improving patient survival. In this regard, we have recently developed a novel molecular genetic technique that can detect and quantitate very low levels of residual leukaemia with great sensitivity and specificity. This technique is ideally suited for use in the routine clinical setting, and as a result of this development, we have now established a clinical trial (ANZCCSG Study VIII) in which patients who have a bad result on this test, will be given more intensive treatment to see if this improves survival rates. A number of research questions will also be addressed in this trial including whether the level of residual leukaemia at the end of therapy is able to predict future relapse that would otherwise not be suspected. It is anticipated that the clinical trial will help define the most appropriate treatment strategies for children with leukaemia. This project, which is at the forefront of such studies worldwide, has major implications for the therapeutic management of children with leukaemia and has the potential of contributing directly to the improved survival of this most common of childhood cancers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glenn Marshall","data":{"first_name":"Glenn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032350","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"Marshall","source_individual_id":"5012634","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Glenn Marshall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85375","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Murray Norris","data":{"first_name":"Murray","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027063","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Norris","source_individual_id":"RMIS147223","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Murray Norris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84000","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michelle Haber","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001974","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haber","source_individual_id":"RMIS147226","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michelle Haber"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77205","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6308","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular targeted therapy in childhood neuroblastoma based on inhibition of the N-myc oncogene","data":{"media_summary":"paediatric oncology","end_year":2007,"keywords":["chemical small molecules","gene targeting","neuroblastoma","oncogene","siRNA"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350885,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cancer","cancer treatment","neuroblastoma","novel therapeutic","paediatric oncology"],"scientific_title":"Molecular targeted therapy in childhood neuroblastoma based on inhibition of the N-myc oncogene","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Murray Norris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350885","simplified_title":"Inhibiting the action of a key cancer-associated gene for improved treatment of the childhood cancer neuroblastoma","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"434250","source_system":"Neuroblastoma is a common cancer of young children which, despite the use of powerful anticancer drugs that cure other childhood cancers, has only a 40% survival rate. Many laboratories have shown that the most aggressive neuroblastoma tumours, which are most resistant to the action of anticancer drugs, have an abnormal number of copies of a cancer-associated gene, called N-myc. Patients whose tumours have multiple N-myc copies have dismal survival prospects, and new treatments for such patients are urgently needed. Several studies, using models of neuroblastoma cells growing in the laboratory, have shown that it is possible to create small fragments of genetic material which can specifically switch off the N-myc gene. When this happens, the neuroblastoma cells behave in a less aggressive and malignant way. We have recently shown that these genetic fragments are capable of reducing the growth of tumours in mice which have been genetically manipulated to develop neuroblastoma. We now want to develop new and improved ways of switching off N-myc and inhibiting neuroblastoma development because these approaches may be extremely valuable for treating neuroblastoma in patients.

The behavioural and brain mechanisms which underpin this persistent propensity to relapse are largely unknown. This project studies the behavioural and brain mechanisms for relapse to drug addiction.

Despite advances in the use of combination chemotherapy, drug resistance is the major cause of treatment failure. An important component in the treatment of many childhood and adult cancers are the antimicrotubule agents. These drugs target an important part of the cell skeleton called the tubulin-microtubule system that is responsible for many important events including cell division. It is the ability of these drugs to disrupt cell division in cancer cells that makes them so effective and such important targets for new drug design. Unfortunately, the reasons why tumours develop resistance to these drugs or even why some tumours do respond well is not understood. This proposal will determine how the makeup and stability of the tubulin-microtubule proteins influences how these drugs work in both childhood and adult tumour cells. Finally, components of drug resistant tumour cells will be examined using technology that allows us to simultaneously separate and identify hundreds of proteins some of which may provide useful targets for the design of new drugs for the treatment of cancer. To improve cancer survival rates it is essential to accurately target the use of existing drugs and to identify new targets for anticancer drug development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Maria Kavallaris","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031695","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kavallaris","source_individual_id":"RMIS125116","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Maria Kavallaris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85205","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6305","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Atherosclerosis","Cardiovascular disease","Control of gene expression","Molecular biology","Molecular pathogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350865,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Nucleic Acids","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Levon Khachigian","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350865","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"811500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Levon Khachigian","data":{"first_name":"Levon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020094","middle_name":"Michael","last_name":"Khachigian","source_individual_id":"RMIS227494","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Levon Khachigian"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82125","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6303","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A survey of the sexual behaviour and sexual health of Australian prisoners","data":{"media_summary":"sexually transmitted infections","end_year":2007,"keywords":["prevalence","prison population","risk factors","sexual behaviour"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350860,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["health risk behaviours","inequalities in health services access and outcomes","injury control and prevention","sexual health","sexually transmitted infections"],"scientific_title":"A survey of the sexual behaviour and sexual health of Australian prisoners","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Tony Butler","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350860","simplified_title":"A survey of the sexual behaviour and sexual health of Australian prisoners","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"591000","source_system":"The Australian Study of Health and Relationships telephone survey recently reported on the sexual attitudes, knowledge, health and behaviour of over 19,000 Australians. One of the groups that was omitted from that survey was prisoners. Yet prisoners are a high-risk group for sexual ill health. Prisoners are mostly drawn from the most disadvantaged groups in society: they are more likely to be unemployed, they have less education and lower incomes than other Australians, and many suffer from minor intellectual disabilities and-or mental illness. This proposed survey of inmates in Australian prisons will fill in this missing data. Prisoners are the forgotten population in many countries. Only a few surveys of prisoners' health have been performed. There are some surveys of sexual behaviour in particular prisons overseas, though most of them concentrate on HIV risks and do not explore the sexual lives of prisoners in the same way as the major national sex surveys in the US, the UK and France did for people living outside prison. Prison is itself a dangerous place for people's sexual health. In prison, much of the sex that occurs is not voluntary. Sexual assault in prisons can lead to serious physical injury as well as risk of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV-AIDS. Although some of these injuries can be sufficiently serious to require surgery, only a small proportion are reported to the authorities. Younger prisoners (aged 18-25) and those who are small, slightly built or gay, are at higher risk of being assaulted. This study will explore the factors surrounding sexual assault in prison and make recommendations for preventing it."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Juliet Richters","data":{"first_name":"Juliet","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039325","middle_name":"","last_name":"Richters","source_individual_id":"RMIS330157","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Juliet Richters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87194","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Tony Butler","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035664","middle_name":"Gerard","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"RMIS1784037","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Tony Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86235","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anthony Falconer","data":{"first_name":"Anthony","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018922","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Falconer","source_individual_id":"RMIS3137683","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Anthony Falconer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81843","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Basil Donovan","data":{"first_name":"Basil","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001330","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Donovan","source_individual_id":"5014375","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Basil Donovan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77045","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6302","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomised controlled falls prevention trial of long distance glasses in elderly multifocal wearers","data":{"media_summary":"Spectacles","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Disability","Elderly","Falls and injury prevention","Multifocal spectacles","Visual impairment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350855,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Accidental falls among older people","Blurred vision","Clinical trial","Injury control and prevention","Spectacles"],"scientific_title":"A randomised controlled falls prevention trial of long distance glasses in elderly multifocal wearers","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Optometry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"OPTOMETRY","cia_name":"Prof Stephen Lord","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350855","simplified_title":"A randomised controlled falls prevention trial of long distance glasses in elderly multifocal wearers","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"493000","source_system":"Each year, one-third to a half of people over 65 years old will fall at least once. The consequences of falls are immense in terms of suffering, loss of independence, fear of future falls, carer burden, mortality, residential care admissions and other health care resource usage. Clearly, effective and affordable falls prevention strategies are needed to address this major health care problem. Over 50% of people over 65 years old use bi-, tri- or multi-focal glasses. The lower part of these glasses are useful for reading and seeing at close range only and there is now evidence that the use of these glasses is associated with an increased risk of falls due to the blurring of vision when looking through the lower lenses at ground level obstacles. This is particularly relevant in unfamiliar outdoor situations. This study will determine whether providing plain distance glasses (with extensive counselling and recommendations for use in standing and walking activities) will prevent falls and their consequences over a one year period in older persons who wear bi-, tri- or multi-focal glasses. Pilot studies suggest that most elderly bi-, tri-, or multi-focal wearers at risk for falls are willing to purchase and use a second pair of glasses if the benefit of new plain distance glasses for their vision is demonstrated. We expect that the results of the study will be incorporated into all relevant areas of clinical practice and public health strategies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Lord","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038138","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lord","source_individual_id":"RMIS5224","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Lord"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86883","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rebecca Ivers","data":{"first_name":"Rebecca","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037478","middle_name":"Q","last_name":"Ivers","source_individual_id":"5015459","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rebecca Ivers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86709","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mark Haran","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0031130","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haran","source_individual_id":"RMIS1625118","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mark Haran"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85067","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judy Simpson","data":{"first_name":"Judy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027965","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Simpson","source_individual_id":"RMIS170478","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Judy Simpson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84217","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ian Cameron","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018077","middle_name":"Douglas","last_name":"Cameron","source_individual_id":"5012435","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ian Cameron"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81622","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6301","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cortical, descending and reflex control of human inspiratory muscles","data":{"media_summary":"sleep apnoea","end_year":2007,"keywords":["central nervous system","control of breathing","motor cortex","sleep apnoea","upper airway muscles"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350853,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["asthma","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)","respiratory failure","respiratory system and diseases","sleep apnoea"],"scientific_title":"Cortical, descending and reflex control of human inspiratory muscles","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Motor Control","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"HUMAN MOVEMENT AND SPORTS SCIENCE","cia_name":"Dr Jane Butler","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350853","simplified_title":"Control of inspiratory muscles","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"324500","source_system":"Of all the skeletal muscles, the breathing muscles perform the most crucial action, that is, they maintain ventilation. The neural control of respiratory muscles must be finely integrated to maintain ventilation while we are awake, asleep, exercising, eating and talking. The neural circuitry for the respiratory muscles is unique. Control of respiratory muscles differs from that of limb muscles because the respiratory motoneurones are activated rhythmically but are controlled via two descending pathways. During automatic breathing, descending neural drive arises from the central respiratory pattern generator in the brainstem. Through this system, disturbances are reflexly compensated for without conscious effort. However, in addition, to automatic control, respiration can also be controlled voluntarily from the motor cortex, for example during speech or a breath hold. However, in humans the neural connections and interactions between these two centres are poorly understood. In addition to descending signals, the activity of inspiratory muscles is affected by sensory reflex inputs. The proposed studies will investigate three aspects of the control of human inspiratory muscles that act to 'pump' air into the lungs and upper airway 'dilator' muscles that act to keep the airway open. Because expiration is usually passive during quiet breathing we will focus on the neural control of inspiration. First, we will investigate some of the reflex connections of human 'pump' and 'dilator' muscles in people with and without obstructive sleep apnoea. Second, we will study the descending control of inspiratory muscles using single motor unit recordings. In addition, we will make the first detailed analysis of single motor unit activity from the tongue. This muscle critically helps preserve breathing when we sleep. Finally, we will examine the interactions between the motor cortex and medulla in the control of breathing about which relatively little is known in awake humans."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Mckenzie","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038434","middle_name":"Kenneth","last_name":"Mckenzie","source_individual_id":"5016369","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr David Mckenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86957","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Gandevia","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030812","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Gandevia","source_individual_id":"5014771","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Simon Gandevia"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84990","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jane Butler","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000667","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"RMIS706035","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jane Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76844","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6300","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"How Changes in the Motor Cortex and Spinal Cord with Exercise   Contribute to Fatigue in Humans","data":{"media_summary":"respiratory impairment","end_year":2007,"keywords":["central nervous system","exercise","fatigue","motoneurone","motor cortex"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350852,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["fatigue","fatigue syndromes","neural injury or pathology","rehabilitation","respiratory impairment"],"scientific_title":"How Changes in the Motor Cortex and Spinal Cord with Exercise   Contribute to Fatigue in Humans","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Motor Control","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"HUMAN MOVEMENT AND SPORTS SCIENCE","cia_name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350852","simplified_title":"How the Nervous System Contributes to Fatigue with Exercise in People","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"311250","source_system":"Fatigue with exercise is a common experience in healthy people and can be a problem in many illnesses. With fatigue people are less able to produce force with their muscles. Much of this weakness occurs because of events in the muscles but some results from changes in the nervous system. The size of the contribution of the nervous system to fatigue is not known for the kinds of exercise that cause fatigue in everyday life e.g. prolonged weak contractions like holding the shopping or a plate of food, rhythmic contractions like walking or painting a wall, and more vigorous exercise that causes changes in breathing and body temperature. The behaviour of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord is altered in fatigue but how and why many of these changes occur, and how they affect the control of movements, is poorly understood. Three approaches are planned. In the first set of studies, we will use brain and nerve stimulation to measure the impact of sustained low-level activities on people's ability to drive their muscles fully. We will identify whether such activities, as well as increased demands on other body systems, can cause fatigue in the nervous system. In the second set of studies, we will investigate whether changes in the motor areas of the brain can alter peoples' performance of fatiguing motor tasks or their perception of how much effort the tasks take. Finally, we will use stimulation of the spinal cord to work out why motor nerve cells in the spinal cord fire more slowly with fatigue. Fatigue is an important symptom which is not confined to diseases of any one system in the body. For example, it is a major complaint in multiple sclerosis, cardiac failure, chronic obstructive airway disease, depression and cancer, as well as after chemotherapy, surgery, and viral illness. The implications of better understanding of the contribution of the nervous system to fatigue range from targeting treatments in patients to improving the performance of athletes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Gandevia","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030812","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Gandevia","source_individual_id":"5014771","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Simon Gandevia"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84990","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Janet","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004957","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS220761","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Janet Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78042","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jane Butler","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000667","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"RMIS706035","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jane Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76844","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6299","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Antiphospholipid Antibodies, Beta 2-Glycoprotein I and control of coagulation.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Animal Model","Antibody","Autoimmunity","Coagulation Protein","Thrombosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350846,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Antiphospholipid Syndrome","Lupus","Recurrent Miscarriages"],"scientific_title":"Antiphospholipid Antibodies, Beta 2-Glycoprotein I and control of coagulation.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Steven Krilis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350846","simplified_title":"Beta 2-Glycoprotein I, antibodies and clotting.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"471000","source_system":"Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with an autoimmune condition characterised by the presence of clots and recurrent miscarriages.

This protein has been thought to be important in controlling the clotting system in humans and other mammals. The evidence for this has been contradictory, however, we have recently made a major new finding on the function of this protein on the clotting system. We will be using sophisticated molecular biology techniques to further characterise the role that Beta 2-GPI has in controlling clotting factors in the body. We have been able to eliminate the gene for Beta 2-GPI in mice thus deriving mice that do not produce any Beta 2-GPI protein. These mice are called Beta 2-GPI knockout mice and will be an ideal animal model to examine the function of Beta 2-GPI and its new role in controlling the clotting cascade by targetting a specific part of this pathway. In addition, these findings may be able to provide new information on how Beta 2-GPI controls clotting factors and the effect of antiphospholipid antibodies on this system, which may lead to new treatments for antiphospholipid antibodies and more generally clotting disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Steven Krilis","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002742","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Krilis","source_individual_id":"RMIS545867","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Steven Krilis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77415","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6298","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Crystallographic studies of CLIC family proteins","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["CLIC protein","chloride channel","membrane protein","protein structure","x-ray crystallography"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350844,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Chronic inflammatory disease","atherosclerosis","rheumatoid arthritis"],"scientific_title":"Crystallographic studies of CLIC family proteins","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Paul Curmi","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350844","simplified_title":"Structure determination of CLIC proteins by x-ray crystallgraphy","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"505500","source_system":"Cells must regulate the flow of ions and water across their membranes in order to survive and function normally.

Our group was the first to identify and characterise a new class of chloride channel which plays a key roles in the regulation of the immune system. These channels are unusual in that they can move between two states: a soluble state and a state that resides in the cell membrane. We have determined the first structures of this class of channel in both the soluble state and what is believed to be the membrane docking state. This has given us the first atomic picture of how this channel protein can alter its structure so as to carry out its function. In this project, we will determine: how the protein completes the transition into the membrane state; the structures of other key members of this class of channel protein; complexes between channel proteins and other cellular proteins; and the structure of the protein in the membrane state. We will also determine how several drugs control the activity of this channel. The results of our work will have specific implications for our channel and will serve as a paradigm other members of this new class of chloride channel. Understanding how this channel functions and how the current drugs control it will lead to the development of a new class of therapeutic agents that will control these channels by preventing the transition from the soluble to the membrane state."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Curmi","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036115","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Curmi","source_individual_id":"5014169","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Paul Curmi"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86358","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6297","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Understanding Immune Control of HIV","data":{"media_summary":"mechanisms","end_year":2007,"keywords":["HIV/AIDS","antibody","cytotoxic T cell","mathematical modelling","vaccines"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350841,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["HIV pathogenesis","HIV vaccines","humoral immunity","immunity, cellular","mechanisms"],"scientific_title":"Understanding Immune Control of HIV","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Miles Davenport","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350841","simplified_title":"Understanding how the immune system controls infection with HIV","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"238000","source_system":"HIV currently infects ~40 million people world-wide, causing ~3 million deaths in 2003, mainly in the world's poorest countries. A cheap, effective vaccine seems the best means of preventing the spread of the epidemic. The two main approaches to vaccination are either to make antibodies (which bind to and inactivate the virus), or killer T cells (which kill infected cells). Many of these vaccines are now being tested in monkeys. The results of killer T cell vaccination trials have been both encouraging and disappointing. The vaccines do not appear able to prevent the monkeys from getting infected with the virus. However, in many cases even though the monkeys become infected with HIV, they do not get the usual disease associated with AIDS, and hence live with rather than die from this infection. The aims of this project are to use statistical analysis, and more complex mathematical and computer models to try to analyse the data generated by these vaccine trials and to understand how these partially effective vaccines help control virus. For example, even if a vaccine does not prevent infection, we can investigate whether it slowed viral growth, or increased killing of infected cells, and if so, whether an increase in this response could be effective. In preliminary work we have analysed data from a vaccination trial performed in Boston. The results of this study suggest that the reason vaccinated monkeys still become infected is that the killer T cells produced by the vaccine do not appear to activate for the first 10 days of infection. In these first 10 days the virus grows normally and is able to establish a foothold for continuing infection. By contrast, we find that antibodies act extremely early after infection. The methods we propose have not been used before to study vaccines, and by studying the kinetics of the virus and immune response from a large number of vaccine trials we hope to help identify the optimal vaccine design."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Perelson","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015537","middle_name":"","last_name":"Perelson","source_individual_id":"RMIS3120542","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alan Perelson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80918","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ruy Ribeiro","data":{"first_name":"Ruy","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004216","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Ribeiro","source_individual_id":"RMIS3120545","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ruy Ribeiro"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77845","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Miles Davenport","data":{"first_name":"Miles","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001178","middle_name":"Philip","last_name":"Davenport","source_individual_id":"5014214","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Miles Davenport"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76990","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6296","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["fatigue","human error","injury prevention","injury risk management","safety"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350840,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Ann Williamson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350840","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"670500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ann Williamson","data":{"first_name":"Ann","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028838","middle_name":"Marina","last_name":"Williamson","source_individual_id":"5012522","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ann Williamson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84469","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6295","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Epithelial - Stromal Interactions in Pancreatic Cancer: Role of Pancreatic Stellate Cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Angiogenic factors","Growth factors","Pancreatic cancer","Pancreatic fibrosis","Pancreatic stellate cells"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350838,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Local and distant metastasis","Pancreatic cancer","Tumour progression"],"scientific_title":"Epithelial - Stromal Interactions in Pancreatic Cancer: Role of Pancreatic Stellate Cells","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Minoti Apte","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350838","simplified_title":"Stellate Cells and Pancreatic Cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"425750","source_system":"The pancreas is the major digestive organ in the body.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy (alone and in combination) result in, at best, limited benefit. Clearly, there is a need for novel approaches to this lethal disease.

Our group is endeavouring to better define the early stages of these disorders, and studying methods of detecting them at an early stage, using the latest neuropsychological and neuroimaging techniques. We wish to investigate new drugs for the prevention of dementia. Much of dementia is not treated early because of lack of training of primary care physicians in identifying dementia, and we are developing methods to deal with this problem. We are also examining the role of cognitive disorders in accidents and suicides in the elderly, and the development of depression. We are determining the role of psychiatric disorders in the care of these patients, and the methods of alleviating the burden of disease.

Despite a perception that prison inmates are unlikely to give up smoking while in prison, a recent survey has found that many inmates have attempted to quit or have reduced the amount they smoke. The same survey reported that almost a quarter of male inmates were planning to give up smoking within the next three months. Depression and anxiety are common among prison inmates. Research has shown that people with depression or anxiety problems are less likely to quit, and more likely to relapse, than smokers without these symptoms. For this reason there has been interest in incorporating antidepressant medications into quit strategies. As a group with a high prevalence of depression and anxiety, prisoners may benefit from an intervention strategy that includes an antidepressant medication. Prisoners are often poorly educated, on a low income or benefits, or from a lower socioeconomic or an indigenous background. Members of this disadvantaged group have been shown to be less likely to use preventive health services, such as smoking cessation programs. This research proposal represents the first large scale randomised controlled trial of a multi-component intervention for tobacco dependence amongst a prisoner population in the world. This project will compare the effectiveness of adding an antidepressant medication to counselling, nicotine replacement therapy, a coping with change package and referral to a Quitline. The proposed research follows a small pilot study of the feasibility of a similar intervention. It brings together the expertise of several people across Australia with experience in tobacco dependence and prison research. The results will inform future smoking interventions for prison inmates and offers a real opportunity to impact upon the health and well-being of some of the most marginalised groups in Australian society."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ian Anderson","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040809","middle_name":"Philip Smith","last_name":"Anderson","source_individual_id":"RMIS3927","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ian Anderson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87583","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Tony Butler","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035664","middle_name":"Gerard","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"RMIS1784037","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Tony Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86235","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kay Wilhelm","data":{"first_name":"Kay","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034716","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Wilhelm","source_individual_id":"RMIS3137677","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kay Wilhelm"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85993","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Alex Wodak","data":{"first_name":"Alex","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023056","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Wodak","source_individual_id":"RMIS225423","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Alex Wodak"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82936","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robyn Richmond","data":{"first_name":"Robyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021704","middle_name":"","last_name":"Richmond","source_individual_id":"RMIS65968","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robyn Richmond"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82582","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anthony Falconer","data":{"first_name":"Anthony","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018922","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Falconer","source_individual_id":"RMIS3137683","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Anthony Falconer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81843","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6292","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of an Endogenously Synthesised Sterol in Regulating Cholesterol Removal from the Macrophage","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["biochemistry - lipid","cholesterol","cholesterol metabolism","drug action","macrophage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350828,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["adverse treatment effects","atherosclerosis","cardiovascular disease","coronary heart disease"],"scientific_title":"Role of an Endogenously Synthesised Sterol in Regulating Cholesterol Removal from the Macrophage","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Metabolism","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Andrew Brown","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350828","simplified_title":"Cholesterol Removal from Cells that lead to Cardiovascular Disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"276000","source_system":"Heart disease remains the greatest killer of Australians and involves accumulation of cholesterol in the artery wall.

These senses, collectively called proprioception, are also involved in the automatic, unconscious control of our muscles. So, ultimately, they allow us to stand and to move freely with precision and confidence, even in the dark. One of these senses, the sense of effort or of heaviness, is believed to be generated within the brain. It intensifies when we become fatigued. These experiments will be concerned with finding out more about how this works. We have a method that uses magnetic stimulation of the brain to change its control of our muscles. Using it we will learn how this sense is generated. When we close our eyes and move our limbs we realise that we know exactly where they are at any point in time. It remains uncertain exactly how this information is generated within the nervous system. One idea, arising from some recent experiments which we want to test, is that as we move the limb, the skin over the moving parts is stretched and stretch-sensitive nerve endings in the skin provide us with information about the movement. Alternatively, perhaps it is the effort we exert to maintain limb position against the force of gravity which tells us where the limb is. In another recent study we have found that when a muscle has become painful from excessive exercise or from some local strain injury, our ability to control the muscle and so move the limb is no longer as effective. We want to study the underlying nervous mechanisms responsible for the changes in movement control. Are they designed to spare the muscle while it recovers from injury? How are they brought about?

Like several other infectious diseases, it is mainly spread by behaviours that most people consider to be part of their private lives, such as sexual intercourse and drug use. In many societies, the search for ways to prevent and treat these infectious has been complicated by the fact that people find them embarrassing to discuss, or fear discrimination if they have them. While surveys of sexually transmitted infections have found high rates in some Indigenous communities in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, so far only Canada has seen increased rates of HIV-AIDS among Indigenous people. There is much we need to learn about prevention and treatment in Indigenous people. We are therefore proposing to set up collaborative studies in each of the three countries that will explore how Indigenous people are able to protect themselves against these infections. We are especially interested in finding out about their resiliency, the way in which they make use of their own and their communitiesï¿½ strengths to protect themselves and enhance their health and well-being. A good understanding of what resiliency is about will help us discover how Indigenous health programs can help all people in their communities to have the best chance of avoiding these infections, or getting the right kind of care, support and treatment if they do have one or more of these infections. The research will be done in full collaboration with Indigenous communities in every aspect, from planning through to regular reporting of results. The program will provide opportunities for Indigenous people in the three countries to develop and enhance research skills in this important area, and allow non-Indigenous people to share knowledge and experience with Indigenous communities."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Kaldor","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008271","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Kaldor","source_individual_id":"5013050","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Kaldor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78930","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5801","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Implementing action to tackle health inequalities, what works & why?

Moreover, factors which are necessary for tumour initiation, might be very good targets for a cancer prevention strategy.

However while essential for organ survival reperfusion results in damage to the organ in a number of cases, including heart, brain, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, with important implications for patient morbidity and mortality. In the kidney lack of blood flow can result in acute kidney failure that is a costly condition to manage often requiring admission to an intensive care unit and is still associated with a significant risk of death. Reperfusion injury that occurs during renal transplantation is currently thought to be an important contributor to delayed establishment of kidney function following transplantation that in turn may increase the incidence of acute and chronic rejection. The studies outlined in this proposal will investigate how molecules involved in the blood clotting system may contribute to the inflammatory response that occurs upon reperfusion of the kidney following prior obstruction of blood flow. We will study a mouse model of kidney reperfusion injury and using genetically modified mice determine the role of various blood clotting-related proteins in subsequent inflammation and organ damage. The approach to be employed will provide a powerful method to determine the role of various molecules and pathways in contributing to kidney damage after reperfusion injury. Interventions that may reduce the incidence or severity of renal damage following kidney reperfusion injury have the potential to be of major benefit to patients and to reduce health care costs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jonathan Erlich","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007164","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Erlich","source_individual_id":"RMIS582218","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Jonathan Erlich"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78631","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Philip Peake","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0003894","middle_name":"","last_name":"Peake","source_individual_id":"RMIS63797","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Philip Peake"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77753","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5409","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Inhibition of fear memories by extinction: neural substrates.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Blood pressure and autonomic function","Limbic system and autonomic nervous system","Prefrontal cortex","Stress and anxiety disorders","System neuroscience"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300538,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Anxiety and other stress-related diseases","Hypertension","Panic attacks","Post-traumatic stress disorder"],"scientific_title":"Inhibition of fear memories by extinction: neural substrates.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Reginald Westbrook","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300538","simplified_title":"How the brain supresses bad memories.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"234250","source_system":"Anxiety disorders [e.g., Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)] are the most prevalent type of psychopathology in the industrialised world. They are associated with characteristic behavioural (e.g., heightened startle) and autonomic (e.g., cardiovascular) reactions. These disorders are often characterised as an inability to regulate the emotion of fear. Significant progress has been made in understanding the neural and cellular processes involved in the establishment of fear memories, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which fear memories can be inhibited or suppressed. Understanding this latter process is a key to the development of effective treatments for anxiety disorders such as PTSD where the patient suffers from persistent, intrusive, unwanted trauma memories. A common experimental procedure for reducing learned fear is to repeatedly expose the subject to a fear-eliciting stimulus but without any aversive outcome. This procedure leads to a progressive loss, or extinction, of the fear reactions elicited by the stimulus. Historically, the extinction of fear was thought to be due to an erasure of the fear memory. However, recent evidence shows that extinction inhibits, rather than erases, the fear memory. Because the fear memories remain intact, some structure(s) in the brain must inhibit activity in the fear pathway. This project uses extinction of conditioned fear reactions in rat subjects to determine the structure(s) in the brain that inhibit fear memories and their behavioural and cardiovascular expression. It brings together the expertise of four well-established researchers and uses a combination of behavioural, physiological, immunohistochemical, tract tracing, and lesion approaches to achieve this aim. The proposed experiments will reveal the structure(s) in the brain that control the inhibition of fear, as well as the site(s) of this inhibition in the fear pathway"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Reginald Westbrook","data":{"first_name":"Reginald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017046","middle_name":"Frederick","last_name":"Westbrook","source_individual_id":"5018254","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Reginald Westbrook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81327","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rick Richardson","data":{"first_name":"Rick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004231","middle_name":"","last_name":"Richardson","source_individual_id":"RMIS69839","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rick Richardson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77849","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Pascal Carrive","data":{"first_name":"Pascal","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000742","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Carrive","source_individual_id":"5013817","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Pascal Carrive"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76871","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5408","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"HCMV protein kinase and DNA polymerase domains involved in antiviral sensitivity, viral replication and cell tropism","data":{"media_summary":"viral infection","end_year":2006,"keywords":["antiviral","cytomegalovirus","molecular genetics","murine models","virology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300532,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["antiviral therapy","biochemistry and molecular biology","gene structure / protein function / novel therapies","infection disease","viral infection"],"scientific_title":"HCMV protein kinase and DNA polymerase domains involved in antiviral sensitivity, viral replication and cell tropism","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof William Rawlinson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300532","simplified_title":"Association of HCMV genes and function","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"269250","source_system":"Many individuals with compromised immune systems - such as those with HIV-AIDS, cancer and transplant recipients are at risk of disease from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Currently the most effective therapies are suppression of virus replication by continuing administration of antiviral agents, principally ganciclovir (GCV), cidofovir (CDV) or foscarnet (phosphonoformic acid or PFA). The use of antivirals for increasingly longer durations in an enlarging population of patients with irreversible chronic immunosuppression, has resulted in the emergence of increasing numbers of drug-resistant HCMV viruses in this group of individuals. In patients with AIDS, 7.6% of isolates in one study were shown to be GCV resistant and we have found similar levels (10.8%) in immunosuppressed Australians. Of the small number of antiviral agents with any useful activity against HCMV, GCV, and aciclovir (ACV) are nucleoside analogues. PFA is a pyrophosphate analogue that competitively inhibits pyrophosphate binding by HCMV DNA polymerase. These drugs are activated by a specific gene of HCMV (UL97 (Pk)) and a mouse virus (MCMV - M97Pk) that is very similar to HCMV.

We are investigating the resistance genotypes and phenotypes in CMV resistant to 7 antiviral drugs including GCV, CDV and PFA.

More than 200,000 14-19 year olds have used cannabis in the last month and 7.1% report daily use. The population prevalence of cannabis dependence increases throughout adolescence, with a rate of 30% among those who use cannabis more than five times per year. Although experimentation is a normal part of adolescent development, regular cannabis use by young people exposes them to the negative effects of cannabis at a time of rapid development and transitions in life roles. There have been no studies reported of interventions suitable for adolescents with cannabis problems who are not seeking treatment but are causing great concern for their families, schools and communities. The Adolescent Cannabis Check-up (ACCU) fills this serious gap by providing adolescents with an opportunity to objectively assess their cannabis use and develop strategies for change in a non-judgemental environment. The ACCU is a 2 session intervention: assessment and a follow-up session of personalised feed-back and brief skills-based therapy. Recruitment may be either direct or via a concerned family member. This novel approach provides parents with telephone coaching, and supporting booklets, on techniques to encourage their young person to participate. A feasibility study of 80 families has found more than 50% were able to do so. That study of 55 adolescents found a significant reduction in levels of cannabis use and an abstinence rate of 24.2% 3 months following participation in the ACCU. This project wll involve a multi-site RCT to compare the impact of the ACCU with a delayed treatment control group, on levels of cannabis use, dependence, and cannabis-related problems. This project would fill a gap in treatment service models and involve families in an initiative to assist young people to develop motivation and skills to abstain from problematic cannabis use."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Steve Allsop","data":{"first_name":"Steve","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023307","middle_name":"","last_name":"Allsop","source_individual_id":"5013164","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Steve Allsop"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82999","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Robert Ali","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011414","middle_name":"Leonard","last_name":"Ali","source_individual_id":"RMIS1162887","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Robert Ali"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79798","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jan Copeland","data":{"first_name":"Jan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006715","middle_name":"","last_name":"Copeland","source_individual_id":"5014066","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jan Copeland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78521","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5402","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Targeting inflammatory mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","Inflammation","Neurotoxicity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300467,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Alzheimer's disease","Dementia","Inflammation"],"scientific_title":"Targeting inflammatory mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Claire Shepherd","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300467","simplified_title":"Inflammation in Alzheimer's disease.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"392750","source_system":"Alzheimer s disease accounts for the majority of dementia cases and is the most common cause for nursing home requirements in Australia. It is not a disease that is confined to old age as it can also affect individuals in their 20s and 30s. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, largely because the underlying cause is unknown. Deposition of the amyloid-beta protein within the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients is thought to be responsible for the neuronal cell loss which underlies the dementia. However, amyloid-beta protein deposition can occur in the absence of dementia and in the asbence of significant neuronal cell loss, suggesting that an alternative mechanism of neurotoxicity exists. Inflammation is a consistent feature of the Alzheimer's disease brain. We have preliminary evidence to suggest that inflammation is responsible for the neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease. We have recently observed a significant inflammatory response surrounding an unidentified protein in the brains of individuals with a familial form of Alzheimer's disease due to a genetic mutation. This inflammatory response is not associated with the significant amyloid-beta protein deposition seen in these cases suggesting that a novel potent inflammatory stimulus exists. Furthermore, these cases have greater neuronal cell loss and a shorter disease duration, both indicators of increased neurotoxicity. The present study is designed to determine the toxicity of inflammation and the stimulus driving this response in the Alzheimer's disease brain using tools for protein and gene analysis, as well as determining the extent of inflammation-mediated toxicity on neuronal cells grown in culture. Only by addressing these aims can we concentrate on developing safe and effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat the disease process."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Claire Shepherd","data":{"first_name":"Claire","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039663","middle_name":"Elaine","last_name":"Shepherd","source_individual_id":"RMIS1824243","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Claire Shepherd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87287","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gary Halliday","data":{"first_name":"Gary","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037074","middle_name":"M.","last_name":"Halliday","source_individual_id":"RMIS192170","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gary Halliday"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86595","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Carolyn Geczy","data":{"first_name":"Carolyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025022","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Geczy","source_individual_id":"RMIS152178","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Carolyn Geczy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83436","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Mark Raftery","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004121","middle_name":"","last_name":"Raftery","source_individual_id":"RMIS152175","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Mark Raftery"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77819","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5401","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification of the molecular genetic basis of the hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency syndrome","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Bone Marrow Transplantation","Endothelial vascular responses","Gene mapping","Immunodeficiency","Veno-Occlusive disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300462,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Bone marrow transplantation","Heritable immunodeficiency","Liver microcirculation","Veno-Occlusive Disease"],"scientific_title":"Identification of the molecular genetic basis of the hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency syndrome","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Robert Lindeman","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300462","simplified_title":"Genetic basis of Veno-Occlusive Disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"224250","source_system":"One of the most serious complications of bone marrow transplantation is veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also termed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). This condition occurs in 10% of transplanted patients and is characterised by abnormalities of liver function, enlargement of the liver, clotting abnormalities, fluid retention and finally failure of multiple organs and death in 30-50% of cases. The cause of VOD is unknown, and its occurrence cannot be predicted in individual patients. Eight families have been described in whom a number of individuals have succumbed to a condition which is clinically and histologically indistinguishable from VOD. Affected individuals also have a form of immunodeficiency (hence termed VODI), and the abnormalities are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. All eight are of Lebanese origin, suggesting that a single genetic ancestral mutation was responsible for the disorder in all families, who are distantly related. We have access to genetic material from three of these families, and are on the way to identifying the causative genetic abnormality. We hypothesise that understanding this abnormality will lead to an understanding of VOD which occurs after bone marrow transplantation. We have used 800 polymorphic genetic markers scattered throughout the genome to identify the location of the genetic abnormality, and have localised the defect to a region of chromosome 2 which contains approximately 37 known and predicted genes. We now aim to determine which of the gene(s) in the candidate region is responsible for VODI, and plan to examine DNA from individuals who have had VOD after transplantation to determine if they have a related abnormality. Finding the VODI gene will benefit these families through the availability of carrier detection and may also lead to an understanding of the veno-occlusive disease that occurs after bone marrow transplantation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Buckley","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041339","middle_name":"Francis","last_name":"Buckley","source_individual_id":"5024991","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Buckley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87719","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Tony Roscioli","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039402","middle_name":"","last_name":"Roscioli","source_individual_id":"5017246","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Tony Roscioli"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87219","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Robert Lindeman","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026319","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lindeman","source_individual_id":"5015996","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Robert Lindeman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83808","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"John Ziegler","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0011329","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ziegler","source_individual_id":"RMIS545155","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"John Ziegler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79781","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5400","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A prospective cohort study of mortality, abstinence, criminality and psychiatric comorbidity","data":{"media_summary":"Psychiatric morbidity","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Longitudinal study","Mortality","Opioid dependence","Psychiatric disorders","Treatment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300454,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Addictive behaviours","Drug addiction","Opioid dependence","Overdose","Psychiatric morbidity"],"scientific_title":"A prospective cohort study of mortality, abstinence, criminality and psychiatric comorbidity","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Maree Teesson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300454","simplified_title":"A prospective cohort study of dependent heroin users","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"419500","source_system":"Over 70 000 Australians are dependent on heroin.

A new family of cell surface proteins termed leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LIRs) has been shown to regulate immune cells by either increasing or decreasing their activity. In this project we will study the role of LIRs in regulating the activity of the major cells involved in allergy and asthma.

The research will build on Centre for Health Equity's (CHETRE) work, since 1997, with the Aboriginal community, Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS) and Area Health Services (AHS) in the region to develop and advocate for services to address the needs of Aboriginal and other disadvantaged communities. CHETRE has supported the Aboriginal workers to develop additional services for Aboriginal women, such as the Aboriginal Home Visiting Team (AHV) and assisted with evaluation of these services. The AHV management comprises representatives from AMS, AHS, the Aboriginal community and CHETRE, and will provide advice and oversight for this project. The AHV developed from community concern about health status of Aboriginal infants and provides ante and postnatal care to infants and mothers. As a part of this service Aboriginal infants are systematically identified by the AHS. Further development of services is limited by lack of information on health status, use of health services, or achievement of developmental milestones by Aboriginal infants in an urban community and the assumption that outcomes are a factor of disadvantage. The researchers intend to describe in meticulous detail obstetric outcomes for 150 Aboriginal infants and their mothers born in 2004-5 and the health and development outcomes of the infants at 12 months. Baseline information on birth weight, Apgar score and obstetric history will be collected from maternal report at 2-3 week post-delivery and from routine data collections. Infants and their mothers will be followed up prospectively with further data collection points at 6 months and 12 months.

We have found a natural protein of the innate immune system, present in macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of patients with acute fatal asthma, which activates mast cells causing release of mediators that trigger asthma attack. We have identified a potential receptor for this protein on human mast cells grown in culture. We will characterise the chemical nature of this receptor and verify that it is functionally important in mast cell activation. Because mast cells reside in almost all body tissues and are also important mediators of host responses to infection and in chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, our studies may indicate novel and unexpected ways in which they are activated. Another key cell in allergic and parasitic diseases is the eosinophil. We have found that two other S100 proteins are expressed in eosinophils from the blood of normal individuals and that the genes that encode these proteins are regulated by mediators that regulate eosinophil migration and survival at allergic sites. However although the numbers these cells are high in lung biopsies from patients with asthma, we find that these proteins are generally not expressed. Because one of the S100 proteins, S100A9, was recently found to be important in the ability of other blood cells to migrate to signals that recruit them into tissues, we will examine whether this protein regulates the ability of eosinophils to migrate. Results from this project will provide new knowledge concerning mechanisms of allergy and may lead to the design of novel strategies to regulate the process. Results may have broader ramifications applicable to other inflammatory and infectious diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Nicodemus Tedla","data":{"first_name":"Nicodemus","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045785","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tedla","source_individual_id":"5017855","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Nicodemus Tedla"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88843","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kenneth Hsu","data":{"first_name":"Kenneth","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025602","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hsu","source_individual_id":"5018917","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Kenneth Hsu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83593","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Carolyn Geczy","data":{"first_name":"Carolyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025022","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Geczy","source_individual_id":"RMIS152178","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Carolyn Geczy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83436","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Zheng Yang","data":{"first_name":"Zheng","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017258","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yang","source_individual_id":"RMIS153492","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Zheng Yang"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81396","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5391","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Behavioural and Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Transition to Severe Conduct Disorder In Adolescence.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Child psychiatry, psychology, pediatrics","Conduct disorder","Mental health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300432,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Child and adolescent mental health","Conduct disorder","Development and health"],"scientific_title":"Behavioural and Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Transition to Severe Conduct Disorder In Adolescence.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Mark Dadds","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300432","simplified_title":"Severe Conduct Disorder in Adolescence.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"343100","source_system":"Conduct disorder represents an enormous cost to Australian society directly via the mental health and forensic systems, and indirect costs via its associations with other mental health problems, relationship problems, impaired social functioning, and substance use problems. Behavioural-family-based treatment have good success rates with young children with cooperative parents, however, there are a minority who progress to chronic problems despite this. Risk and resilience factors identifying chronic patterns in early childhood are the key to early intervention. In previous research, this research team showed for the first time that callous-unemotional traits, a feature of chronic psychopathy, could be measured in children as young as 4 years, and was predictive of a range of negative outcomes. However, it was also found that the key neuropsychiatric markers characteristic of psychopathy, including reward dominance-punishment insensitivity and deficits in affective empathy, did not exist in conduct problem children prior to adolescence. Around the time of puberty, it appears that important changes occur in cognitive-affective processing styles that are associated with the adult form of psychopathy and antisocial behaviour. Thus, this research raises critical questions about the development of severe antisocial behaviour (or psychopathy) through the childhood to adolescent years. Our evidence indicates that early adolecence may be the period when intrapsychological characteristics representing chronic risk become concrete. The current research will be the first to map the development common neuropsychiatric markers (affective empathy, punishment insensitivity) of severe antisocial processes through the late childhood-adolescent period. The findings will have clear implications for models of antisocial behaviour and clinical approaches to working with conduct problem children and adolescents."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Dadds","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012594","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Dadds","source_individual_id":"RMIS96625","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Dadds"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80114","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5390","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"IL-16 regulates mast cell chemotaxis and function through the tetraspanin CD9.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Chemotaxis","Mast cells","Tetraspanins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300431,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Allergy","Asthma","HIV-1"],"scientific_title":"IL-16 regulates mast cell chemotaxis and function through the tetraspanin CD9.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Allergy","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Steven Krilis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300431","simplified_title":"A receptor on mast cells for an inflammatory cytokine.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"465750","source_system":"Mast cells are found in humans and other mammals at strategic sites such as skin, lining of the airways and gut and provide a first line of defence against a variety of infections.

In normal circumstances mast cells are only found in the tissues and not in the peripheral blood. However, we have made the first observation that mast-like cells occur in the peripheral blood of patients with asthma and allergic conditions but not in normals. This finding changed the prevailing paradigm for mast cell biology. The products that can influence mast cell growth and function are vital to the understanding of how mast cells are involved in conditions such as human asthma. We have demonstrated that a protein (CD9) on mast cells in the tetraspanin family is a receptor for a product (IL-16) which is thought to be important in asthma and other inflammatory conditions.

Amongst the findings has been a clear demonstration that vestibular function declines with age, starting relatively early. This proposal builds upon the findings of the previous application. Two main types of investigations are planned. In one a new technique of activating the vestibular apparatus (localised skull vibration) will be used to study the brain areas that receive its signals (evoked potentials). This will be the first time that it has been possible to study the connections between the balance organs and the cortex of the brain in intact humans. I will apply the technique to patients with disturbed vestibular function to improve our knowledge of how the brain adapts to disease of these organs. In the second part of this study, a series of recordings will be done measuring sway under a variety of conditions both in normal volunteers and in patients with some common disease states affecting balance. This should reveal new information about both the factors that affect normal balance function and why balance is disturbed in these diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Colebatch","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041702","middle_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Colebatch","source_individual_id":"RMIS527866","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Colebatch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87817","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5387","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["bladder","intestine","neurotensin","receptors","tachykinins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300409,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Elizabeth Burcher","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300409","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"774250","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Burcher","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035624","middle_name":"","last_name":"Burcher","source_individual_id":"RMIS221428","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Burcher"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86226","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5386","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Posttraumatic Mental Health: Enhancing Resilience and Recovery","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Anxiety","Cognitave Behaviour Therapy","Mental health","Military Psychiatry","Posttraumatic stress disorder"],"nhmrc_grant_id":300403,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Posttraumatic Mental Health: Enhancing Resilience and Recovery","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Richard Bryant","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/300403","simplified_title":"Posttraumatic Mental Health","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"5043011.64","source_system":"Psychological disorders following exposure to trauma account for a significant proportion of the burden of disease in terms of personal suffering, decreased productivity, occupational and social dysfunction, medical disorders, and demands on health services.

The brain regulates appetite through a number of chemical transmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) which is present in the brains of mammals and causes increased food intake. The effects of overeating from a young age on these brain transmitters has been largely ignored although this may impact on subsequent eating behaviour. In addition to NPY we will study other transmitters in the brain that have profound effects on appetite, some increasing, and others decreasing, food intake. These may form useful therapeutic targets for new drugs for obesity. Key targets we will study include melanocortins, glucagon-like peptide 1, urocortin, melanin concentrating hormone, agouti related peptide, and NPY. We will determine whether overnutrition from birth to weaning leads to changes in these appetite regulating neurotransmitters in the brain, and monitor the hormonal signals that impact on their activity. We will also determine whether early overnutrition exacerbates the subsequent responses to a high fat diet by comparison with rats made obese as adults. We will measure brain concentrations of the neurotransmitters, the amount released from the brain, and determine whether the feeding responses to injections of these agents is altered in obese animals. We have evidence that these transmitters interact in a co-ordinated fashion to affect feeding; this project will examine whether these interactions are maintained in the various types of obesity. Rats are commonly used for this type of study as the processes regulating feeding are very similar to those in humans and these agents cause similar effects in rats and humans. It is hoped that this information will provide new insight into the way brain adapts to overnutrition, and provide potential treatments for obesity and other feeding disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Margaret Morris","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009227","middle_name":"Joan","last_name":"Morris","source_individual_id":"5016557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Margaret Morris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79210","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5343","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Evidence-based health policy and modelling research in vaccine preventable diseases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["infectious diseases","vaccines"],"nhmrc_grant_id":297110,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Evidence-based health policy and modelling research in vaccine preventable diseases","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Preventive Medicine","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Chandini Raina MacIntyre","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/297110","simplified_title":"Evidence-based health policy and modelling research in vaccine preventable diseases","sub_type":"Population Health CDF","total_budget":"452813.7","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Raina Macintyre","data":{"first_name":"Raina","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026436","middle_name":"Chandini","last_name":"Macintyre","source_individual_id":"5012191","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Raina Macintyre"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83834","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5278","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Vascular Myogenic Vasoconstriction: Ca2+ signalling mechanisms.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["arterioles","calcium","mechanotransduction","sodium-calcium exchange","vascular smooth muscle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":292912,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Vascular Reactivity","cardiovascular disease and hypertension","microvascular disease","peripheral vascular disorder"],"scientific_title":"Vascular Myogenic Vasoconstriction: Ca2+ signalling mechanisms.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Physiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Michael Hill","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/292912","simplified_title":"Mechanisms Underlying Arteriolar Vasoconstriction.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"384750","source_system":"Our studies are aimed at examining how blood flow and pressure is controlled in the various tissues of the body. In particular, we hope to improve our understanding of how blood flow is matched to local metabolic requirements and how a constancy of conditions can be maintained despite changes in overall blood pressure. This ability to control local blood flow occurs through the ability of very small arteries to rapidly adjust their diameters through vasoconstriction or vasodilatation. The vessels can thus act as valves regulating the transfer of blood flow and pressure to smaller vessels downstream. One particular response that small arteries exhibit is the ability to constrict when pressure within the vessels increases. The increase in pressure appears to stretch the vessel wall which in turn initiates a series of mechanical and biochemical steps that ultimately lead to contraction of muscle cells within the vessel wall. By contracting, the vessels limit the increase in downstream flow and pressure that would be expected to occur. The vessels being studied are very small, typically less than 100 micron. They are studied under isolated and controlled conditions using microscope and computer-based imaging techniques. While this allows us to directly monitor changes in vessel diameter to various stimuli (e.g. a change in pressure) we have also had to miniaturize biochemical measurements so we can understand the chemistry which underlies these vasoconstrictor responses. Understanding of how these local blood regulatory mechanisms occur is not only relevant to our understanding of the normal situation but is also vital to understanding disease states. For example, this work is very relevant to common cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension. It is hoped that a detailed understanding of the biochemical pathways by which small arteries contract will allow the design and targeting of pharmaceutical approaches for treatment of vascular disease states."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael

minority develop long term complications, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. The dominant mode of transmission of this virus is via blood-to-blood contact, particularly via injecting drug use. Prisons appear to be a key focus of transmission of hepatitis C in the community as the majority of inmates are incarcerated for drug-related crimes, and injecting drug use remains prevalent whilst in prison. In addition, as almost one in two inmates are already infected at the time of incarceration, those who are uninfected appear to be at significant risk of becoming infected through other (non-injecting) routes such as tattooing, fights and other coincidental blood exposures. This application seeks support for the HITS study (Hepatitis C Incidence and Transmission in Prisons study) - a prospective cohort study of inmates of NSW prisons. Following a successful pilot in which the substantial bureaucratic and logistical hurdles were resolved, the main cohort has been enroling since late 2000. The initial data have confirmed a high rate of at risk behaviour amongst inmates and three primary HCV infections acquired in prison have been documented featuring an unusual antibody negative pattern which would typically pass undetected in screening assays for HCV infection. After exposure to HCV and the development of primary infection, approximately one in five individuals successfully resolves the infection and clears the virus, presumably via an efficient immune response or a non-virulent virus, or a combination of these factors. Therefore, in addition to the public health aspects of the HITS study, the research also aims to define the immunological and virological factors which allow clearance of HCV. These studies will provide key information to guide treatment and immunisation strategies against hepatitis C."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kate Dolan","data":{"first_name":"Kate","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030417","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dolan","source_individual_id":"RMIS572173","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kate Dolan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84897","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof William Rawlinson","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015780","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Rawlinson","source_individual_id":"RMIS4811796","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof William Rawlinson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80974","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Rosemary Ffrench","data":{"first_name":"Rosemary","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012999","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Ffrench","source_individual_id":"RMIS2993037","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Rosemary Ffrench"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80217","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr George Marinos","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003175","middle_name":"","last_name":"Marinos","source_individual_id":"RMIS109361","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr George Marinos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77545","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003008","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lloyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS117886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77503","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Haber","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001975","middle_name":"Steven","last_name":"Haber","source_individual_id":"5011577","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Paul Haber"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77206","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4021","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Impact of oesophageal afferent processing on regulatory and protective reflexes, and perception of symptoms","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Diagnostic techniques","Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease","Gastrointestinal motility","Neural reflexes","Visceral perception"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222880,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Gastro-oesophageal reflux","Novel therapies for reflux disease","Pathophysiology"],"scientific_title":"Impact of oesophageal afferent processing on regulatory and protective reflexes, and perception of symptoms","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ian Cook","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222880","simplified_title":"Oesophageal afferents in reflux disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"247500","source_system":"Symptoms of acid reflux, heartburn and regurgitation, are extremely common, occurring weekly in 20% of the population. Curiously, about 1-4 of people with heartburn don't have any more acid exposing their oesophagus than do normal people. We do not understand this apparent increased sensitivity. Many patients with reflux present with cough, asthma, hoarseness, sore throat or even lung fibrosis. Regurgitation of acid causes some of these conditions. It is estimated that 60% of adult asthmatics have reflux for example. The purpose of this research is to examine the notion that the sensory nerves coming from the oesophagus are somehow tuned up to fire off too readily. If true this phenomenon may well underlie the inappropriate relaxation of the oesophageal valve mechanisms that normally prevent acid flowing up into the throat and into the airways. Additionally it may explain why so many sufferers seem to be hypersensitive to even small amounts of acid. These studies will better define the nerve pathways involved in heartburn and regurgitation and help us target these diseases with specific drugs in the future."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ian Cook","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001008","middle_name":"James Sydney","last_name":"Cook","source_individual_id":"5014031","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ian Cook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76938","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4020","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The mechanism of action of secreted phospholipase A2 and its inhibition in inflammation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["inflammation","phospholipase A2","signalling pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222870,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["anti-inflammatory agents","arthritis","inflammatory diseases"],"scientific_title":"The mechanism of action of secreted phospholipase A2 and its inhibition in inflammation","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Dr Kieran Scott","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222870","simplified_title":"Phospholipase A2 in inflammation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"554400","source_system":"Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is an important mediator of inflammation and is clinically associated with the onset and severity of several immune-mediated diseases including arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, psoriasis and recently prostate cancer.

We have shown that sPLA2 can by itself and in combination with inflammatory cytokines modulate signalling pathways in cells derived from the joints of patients with arthritis to upregulate inflammatory molecules. How this happens is completely unknown. We plan to work out how this enzyme does this. We have also developed small cyclic peptide inhibitors of sPLA2 which potently block the function of the enzyme in these cells. We plan to determine how this happens and if these inhibitors are effective at blocking inflammation and arthritis. The proposal may identify new mechanisms by which secreted factors upregulate inflammation in human cells and may lead to the discovery of new ways to intervene to block these pathways."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Kieran Scott","data":{"first_name":"Kieran","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033695","middle_name":"F.","last_name":"Scott","source_individual_id":"RMIS161556","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Kieran Scott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85724","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Garry Graham","data":{"first_name":"Garry","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025151","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Graham","source_individual_id":"RMIS225603","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Garry Graham"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83467","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof H Patrick Mcneil","data":{"first_name":"H Patrick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020803","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mcneil","source_individual_id":"5016419","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof H Patrick Mcneil"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82324","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4019","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An examination of the causes of mortality following imprisonment in New South Wales using data-linkage.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["electronic record linkage","indigenous Australian","intravenous drug user","mortality","prison population"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222849,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["indigenous health","mortality","population-based record linkage","prison population"],"scientific_title":"An examination of the causes of mortality following imprisonment in New South Wales using data-linkage.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Tony Butler","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222849","simplified_title":"An examination of the causes of mortality following imprisonment in New South Wales using data-linkage.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"205500","source_system":"Prisoner populations are characterised by poor health status including infectious diseases, injury, risk taking behaviours (eg. smoking and self-harm), mental illness, and substance abuse. Serosurveys of blood borne viruses such as hepatitis C and hepatitis B conducted in Australian and overseas prison settings have found that over one third of inmates have been exposed to these viruses with higher rates detected in injecting drug users and female inmates. Few attempts have been made to examine the causes of mortality among prisoners following release from detention. Most interest has focused on overdoses in the period immediately following release; the aim of this study will examine all causes of death among individuals exposed to the correctional environment and compare these to death rates for NSW. Correctional centres house a largely male (94% in NSW) population with backgrounds of disadvantage in all areas, including Indigenous Australians, people of lower socio-economic status, those with a mental illness, and the intellectually disabled. There are currently over 21,000 (June 2001) prisoners detained in Australian correctional centres with approximately 39% housed in NSW. Fifteen percent of the NSW prisoners are Indigenous but comprise only 2% of the general population. The aims of this project will be to: (1) Identify all causes of death among ex-prisoners in NSW for the period 1985 to 2001; (2). Compare death rates in the study group with those in the NSW community; (3) Correlate pre-release health information contained in medical records with specific causes of death; (4) Compare causes of mortality among various sub-groups eg. injecting drug users, the mentally ill, violent offenders, and the intellectually disabled; (5) Examine causes of mortality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous inmates; and (6) use this information to develop pre-release programmes aimed at reducing excess mortality among this group."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr Alan Brnabic","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041289","middle_name":"Jm","last_name":"Brnabic","source_individual_id":"RMIS1784040","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr Alan Brnabic"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87706","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Tony Butler","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035664","middle_name":"Gerard","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"RMIS1784037","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Tony Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86235","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Matthew Law","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020290","middle_name":"Gwyn","last_name":"Law","source_individual_id":"5015891","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Matthew Law"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82179","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Levy","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008631","middle_name":"Herbert","last_name":"Levy","source_individual_id":"5015948","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Levy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79039","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4018","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel compounds for use as inhibitors of virulence of human pathogens","data":{"media_summary":"Novel therapeutic agents","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Anti-microbial therapy","Inter-cellular signalling","Multi-drug resistance","Pathogenic bacteria","Regulationo of virulence in pathogens"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222847,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Bacterial pathogens","Cell-cell communication","Inhibition of virulence factor expression","Multi-drug resistance","Novel therapeutic agents"],"scientific_title":"Novel compounds for use as inhibitors of virulence of human pathogens","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Staffan Kjelleberg","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222847","simplified_title":"The development of new compounds for the treatment of human disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"220500","source_system":"There is growing concern over the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria which are no longer treatable with the current generation of antibiotics. This highlights the urgent need for development of the next generation of therapeutic agents to supplement or replace the current antibiotics. Our research team has identified a class of compounds which are naturally produced by a marine alga that may be effective in the control of bacterial pathogens. These compounds work by interfering with the way many pathogens regulate the production of virulence traits. Some bacteria are able to signal members of their population by the specific uptake and recognition, through a receptor protein, of chemical cues they secrete into the environment. Accumulation of these cues or signals triggers expression of the genes that code for the virulence traits. Moreover, one particular class of these signal response proteins has been identified in many pathogens and has been shown to regulate protease production and production of a protective extracellular slime layer called a capsule. If one or more of these traits can be blocked, then the virulence of the bacterium can be reduced. We have preliminary data which demonstrates that the algal compounds do in fact prevent the expression of virulence traits and thus should be useful as new agents for the treatment of disease. The causative agents of cholera and severe gatroenteritis, Vibrio cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus respectively, have one or the other of these virulence traits, but the pathogen Vibrio vulnificus has all three and therefore is an excellent model pathogen. We propose to explore the ability of the algal compounds to specifically shut down expression of virulence factors with a long term aim for the development of these compounds as novel antimicrobial therapies for the post-antibiotic era."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Staffan Kjelleberg","data":{"first_name":"Staffan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037790","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kjelleberg","source_individual_id":"RMIS176243","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Staffan Kjelleberg"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86786","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Diane Mcdougald","data":{"first_name":"Diane","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032453","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mcdougald","source_individual_id":"RMIS3814182","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Diane Mcdougald"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85402","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4017","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An extended follow-up of stroke patients for cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders: Sydney Stroke Study","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Cognitive deficit","Dementia","Magnetic resonance imaging","Stroke","Vascular dementia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222842,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Psychiatric disorders following stroke","Vascular Cognitive impairment","Vascular dementia"],"scientific_title":"An extended follow-up of stroke patients for cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders: Sydney Stroke Study","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Perminder Sachdev","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222842","simplified_title":"Longitudinal study of neuropsychiatric disorders in stroke patients","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"321800","source_system":"Vascular Dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. In fact, it may be a preventable cause of dementia. Yet it has been relatively neglected by researchers until the last decade, which has seen an upsurge of interest in this disorder. There is no consensus on the criteria for dementia. The profile of early cognitive impairment due to vascular factors is still poorly understood, and the longitudinal course of VaD as defined by modern criteria has not been studied. There have been few studies of the progressive changes in MRI in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The overlap of VaD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a problem for taxonomists and clinicians. One approach to the study of VaD is to examine a high risk group of subjects longitudinally to determine the early features, the risk factors and progressive changes. With this in mind, we began studying a cohort of stroke patients who are at high risk of VaD, in 1997-1999, and are following them longitudinally. The follow-up is now in its third year, and three neuropsychological assessments and two MRI-MRS scans have been performed. We propose to extend the follow-up to 5 years, with repeat neuropsychiatric, neuropsychological and MRI-MRS investigations, and wherever possible to necropsy, to determine the nature of vascular pathology that underlies cognitive impairment. Our cohort of stroke patients is arguably the most comprehensively assessed such cohorts internationally, and presents an excellent opportunity for a long-term follow-up study."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Alessandro Zagami","data":{"first_name":"Alessandro","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0046495","middle_name":"Stefano","last_name":"Zagami","source_individual_id":"5018542","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Alessandro Zagami"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89043","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Henry Brodaty","data":{"first_name":"Henry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035553","middle_name":"","last_name":"Brodaty","source_individual_id":"5012210","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Henry Brodaty"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86208","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Perminder Sachdev","data":{"first_name":"Perminder","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016022","middle_name":"Singh","last_name":"Sachdev","source_individual_id":"5012216","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Perminder Sachdev"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81041","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4016","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neural transplantation of human bone marrow stromal cells to replace oligodendrocytes lost in multiple sclerosis","data":{"media_summary":"stem cell transplantation","end_year":2005,"keywords":["multiple sclerosis","stem cells","transplantation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222839,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cell growth/differentiaiton","multiple sclerosis","neural transplantation","neurological disorders","stem cell transplantation"],"scientific_title":"Neural transplantation of human bone marrow stromal cells to replace oligodendrocytes lost in multiple sclerosis","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurosciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Bruce Brew","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222839","simplified_title":"Transplantation of stem cells for the treatment of multiple sclerosis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"249750","source_system":"Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system in which myelin (an insulative coating around the axons of neurons) and oligodendrocytes (the cells that produce myelin) are attacked and damaged by an unknown process. This damage is referred to as demyelination and results in a blocking or weakening of nerve signal conduction. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis are weakness, tingling or numbness of limbs, and double vision or visual loss. One strategy to repair the demyelination is to transplant cells into the damaged brain that can replace the damaged oligodendrocytes and remyelinate. Studies have shown that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and neural stem cells transplanted into the brain can mature into oligodendrocytes and myelinate axons. However these cells are very difficult to obtain, the best source is foetal terminations but the use of such tissue raises ethical and practical problems. Recently cells found in adult bone marrow, called marrow stromal cells, have been shown to differentiate into neural cells when transplanted into the brain. This raises the possibility that sufferers of multiple sclerosis may be able to have marrow stromal cells taken from their bone marrow and then transplanted into their brains to replace their damaged oligodendrocytes. Our study will investigate the differentiation of marrow stromal cells into oligodendrocytes and determine if marrow stromal cells transplanted into demyelinated mouse brain can replace damaged oligodendrocytes and remyelinate areas of damage."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bruce Brew","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023776","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Brew","source_individual_id":"RMIS548793","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bruce Brew"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83107","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Rosanne Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Rosanne","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004960","middle_name":"","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS15534","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Rosanne Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78043","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4015","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structure-function studies of ion permeation and selectivity in recombinant glycine receptor channels","data":{"media_summary":"neurotransmitters","end_year":2005,"keywords":["glycine receptors","ion channels","ligand-gated ion channels","membrane permeability","patch clamping"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222830,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["basic science","biological sciences","hyperekplexia, Startle disease","neurotransmission","neurotransmitters"],"scientific_title":"Structure-function studies of ion permeation and selectivity in recombinant glycine receptor channels","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"E/Pr Peter Barry","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222830","simplified_title":"How molecular structure determines how ions are selected and pass through neurotransmitter channels","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"331300","source_system":"Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are members of a superfamily of receptor channels, with very significant structural and functional similarities, which play a major role in fast synaptic neurotransmission within the brain and spinal cord, and underlying the complex behaviour of the nervous system, but when dysfunctional can result in major neurological problems. Glycine is one of the two most important inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Impaired glycine-mediated neurotransmission underlies a range of inherited neurological diseases and already, it has been shown that the human disorder, familial Startle disease (hyperekplexia) occurs because of point mutations that have impaired the permeation and activation of the glycine receptor (GlyR). Similarly, certain epilepsies are now known to be caused by mutations in, or close to, the channel region in the excitatory acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), which affect channel activation and ion permeation. However, because of their very significant structural and functional similarities, information obtained in one member of the LGIC family of receptors has strong potential application to the other members and the GlyR with its simpler structure has certain advantages for investigation. The first aim of this project is to investigate how the molecular biological structure of these ion channels controls permeation, how it affects how different ions are selectively allowed to move through it and how it affects channel activation. A second related aim is to learn more about the process of desensitization of GlyR receptors, whereby a sustained presence of a high concentration of agonist can cause a reduction in receptor response. A third aim is to specifically investigate the mechanisms underlying the mode of molecular disruption resulting from two new Startle disease mutations, which, in addition to their own inherent clinical value, can also give general information about receptor function."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Andrew Moorhouse","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032671","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Moorhouse","source_individual_id":"RMIS6501","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Andrew Moorhouse"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85459","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Peter Barry","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005976","middle_name":"Hosford","last_name":"Barry","source_individual_id":"RMIS6624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Peter Barry"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78333","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4014","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Evaluation of multidisciplinary care plans for patients with diabetes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["1.

This initiative, announced in late 1999, provides access to Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items to remunerate general practitioners, involved in developing multidisciplinary care plans in cooperation with other health care providers. An issue of importance, and the one that this project investigates, is whether disease specific care is addressed in care plans and whether the care planning process is associated with improved provision and outcomes of care for a specific chronic illness. The chronic illness that has been chosen for this research project is diabetes because of its prevalence in the community, importance in general practice and because there are accepted standards of process and outcomes of care against which diabetes care contained in EPC care plans can be bench marked. Diabetes is estimated to affect 7.5% of the adult Australian population with more than 85% of those affected having type 2 or mature onset diabetes. Increasingly care of type 2 diabetes is provided in primary care under share care arrangements with specialist diabetes services and in a multidisciplinary team approach involving the patient and their carer as well as relevant health professionals. A recent review has shown that there is a lack of evidence on whether multidisciplinary care is associated with improved process and outcomes of diabetes care. The project will involve 50 general practitioners and 200 of their patients with diabetes in South West Sydney. The design of the project involves audit of the care plans to examine the extent and quality of the diabetes care contained in comparison to accepted benchmarks. The project will also audit the patients' medical records for the year of care before and after the care plan. This care will be compared to published guidelines for process of care and goals for outcomes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Harris","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019476","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Harris","source_individual_id":"RMIS575752","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Harris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81960","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Joan Burns","data":{"first_name":"Joan","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0018017","middle_name":"","last_name":"Burns","source_individual_id":"RMIS1795235","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Joan Burns"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81607","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Elizabeth Comino","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012421","middle_name":"Jean","last_name":"Comino","source_individual_id":"RMIS5302175","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Elizabeth Comino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80061","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicholas Zwar","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005684","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Zwar","source_individual_id":"5012538","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Nicholas Zwar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78252","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4013","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Targeted Cancer Chemotherapy: The Potential of L-Nucleoside Prodrugs","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["5-fluoro-2'deoxyuridine","DNA damage","L-nucleoside","cisplatin","purine nucleoside transport"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222828,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["anti-tumour agents","anticancer drug action","cancer chemotherapy","drug design"],"scientific_title":"Targeted Cancer Chemotherapy: The Potential of L-Nucleoside Prodrugs","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Vincent Murray","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222828","simplified_title":"A new way to target toxic drugs into cancer cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"204750","source_system":"The aim of this project to develop novel anti-cancer agents.

S. aureus keratitis is difficult to treat using conventional antibiotics as although bacteria may be eliminated, vision loss may still result from scarring. S. aureus also causes a wide range of hospital associated infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis, bacteremia, wound infections, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. In recent times strains of S. aureus have emerged which are multi-drug resistant including methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These may only be treated with the drug Vancomycin. However, vancomycin resistant S. aureus have been reported in both Japan and the USA. Now, the search for new treatments for this bacterium is of vital importance. This project will utilise the novel S.aureus mouse model for keratitis, which we have developed in our laboratories. Our model will enable us to investigate the host responses to bacterial infection. Existing models in the rabbit do not allow such detailed studies due to the lack of existing molecular probes and antibodies. Insights into potential adjunct therapies will also be gained.

Hence the burden of disease due to mental disorders in Australia persists. Why is this so? Is there something unique about mental disorders that means little can be done with direct treatment? The feasibility and affordability of mental health treatment can only be truly understood in comparison with other chronic disorders. Such comparisons are particularly significant as mental health remains a stigmatised area of the health sector. Without comparative data it would be easy for critics to argue for decreased funding for people with mental disorders. Project Outcomes: For three chronic physical disorders in Australia (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma) this project will define the cost-effectiveness of current care, the cost-effectiveness of optimal care (everyone getting treatments that work), and the amount of disease burden that can be averted with high-quality health care. These findings will be compared to similar calculations we have produced for mental disorders, to determine if it is mental disorders or chronic disorders per se that require much more effort by the health care system in Australia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Helen Lapsley","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014360","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lapsley","source_individual_id":"RMIS1127146","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Helen Lapsley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80578","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gavin Andrews","data":{"first_name":"Gavin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005813","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Andrews","source_individual_id":"5013220","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gavin Andrews"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78288","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Kristy Sanderson","data":{"first_name":"Kristy","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004433","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Sanderson","source_individual_id":"5017341","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Kristy Sanderson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77901","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4010","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Single nephron GFR and tubuloglomerular feedback before and after birth.","data":{"media_summary":"Renal development & renal disease & hypertension as adults","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Fetal origins of adult disease","Fetal physiology","Kidney","Micropuncture","Renal function"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222757,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Fetal development","Fetal origins of adult disease","Hypertension","Kidney disease","Renal development & renal disease & hypertension as adults"],"scientific_title":"Single nephron GFR and tubuloglomerular feedback before and after birth.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Karen Gibson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222757","simplified_title":"Control of filtration in the kidney before and after birth","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"402428","source_system":"In this project we want to study the forces responsible for the filtration of plasma by the kidney during development.

In NSW alone, there are approximately 770 new cases of severe brain injury each year. These people require extensive inpatient rehabilitation and many go on to rely upon community resources for the rest of their lives. The social and economic cost of such injury is cumulative. TBI is mainly experienced by young adults (18-24 years of age) who have normal life expectancy and each year more casualties are added to this social burden. Adults with TBI frequently experience a reduction in social skills. Loss of social skills presents major obstacles to reintegration into the community by making the sufferer more taxing and less rewarding to interact with socially. This loss of social skills limits their ability to maintain pre-injury relationships, and often creates an off-putting first impression on potential new acquaintances that interferes with their ability to establish new relationships. The following project is designed to develop and evaluate a treatment program to enhance the TBI individual's ability to create a good first impression on meeting new acquaintances - e.g., potential employers, work colleagues, customers, and social acquaintances - and to engage in behaviour that is mutually rewarding. The project will inform current theoretical approaches to remediation, providing an examination of the modifiability of social skills deficits that are the result of underlying cognitive impairments. It will provide a systematic, integrated social skills treatment approach for both individuals and groups where there are currently very few. The identification and refinement of successful treatment techniques will increase the efficiency of brain injury rehabilitation in Australia, improve the quality of life for sufferers of TBI and their families, reduce cost of rehabilitation and reduce reliance upon community resources in the long term."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robyn Tate","data":{"first_name":"Robyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045761","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Tate","source_individual_id":"5017842","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robyn Tate"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88836","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Skye Mcdonald","data":{"first_name":"Skye","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038392","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mcdonald","source_individual_id":"5016337","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Skye Mcdonald"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86946","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leanne Togher","data":{"first_name":"Leanne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028425","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Togher","source_individual_id":"5017950","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Leanne Togher"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84351","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4008","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Immune regulation, cellular trafficking and chemokine receptors in intestinal inflammation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Crohn's disease","T cell immunity","chemokine","gut immunity","ulcerative colitis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222752,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cellular immunity","inflammatory bowel disease","mucosal immunity","regulation of immune response"],"scientific_title":"Immune regulation, cellular trafficking and chemokine receptors in intestinal inflammation","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Grimm","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222752","simplified_title":"Immunoregulation in IBD","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"204750","source_system":"The intestine is exposed to a vast array of foreign substances, or antigens, from food to the abundant bacteria that populate the gut. The gut immune system has developed elaborate and poorly understood mechanisms for preventing inflammation in response to these antigens. A breakdown in these control mechanisms may be partly responsible for the chronic intestinal diseases known as inflammatory bowel diseases, which cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea and bleeding. A recently described immune cell type, known as a regulatory T cell (T reg), is a powerful candidate cell as a master controller of intestinal inflammation. We know that T cells move to various sites in the body under the influence of hormone-like proteins known as chemokines, but the existence of T reg cells in the intestine, their characteristics, their behaviour and their specific response to chemokines, are all unknown. These studies aim to examine the presence and nature of T reg cells in human and mouse intestine, in both health and inflammation, and to explore how these cells migrate into the gut under the influence of chemokines. This knowledge will help in our understanding of intestinal immunity and endogenous regulation of immune responses, and will provide new targets for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and potentially other inflammatory diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Grimm","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025198","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Grimm","source_individual_id":"RMIS132630","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Grimm"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83483","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003008","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lloyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS117886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77503","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4007","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"IMMUNE-MEDIATED INFLAMMATION IN DORSAL ROOT GANGLIA AFTER PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY AND IN SENSORY NEUROPATHIES","data":{"media_summary":"Spinal cord injury","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Chronic neuropathic pain","Inflammation in the nervous system","Neuroimmune response to injury","Peripheral nerve damage","Spinal cord damage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222751,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Neuropathic pain","Rehabilitation after trauma","Sensory abnormalities after injury","Sensory neuropathies","Spinal cord injury"],"scientific_title":"IMMUNE-MEDIATED INFLAMMATION IN DORSAL ROOT GANGLIA AFTER PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY AND IN SENSORY NEUROPATHIES","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurosciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Elspeth McLachlan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222751","simplified_title":"Immune -mediated inflammation in sensory ganglia as the basis for chronic pain and nerve cell loss after injuries","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"378300","source_system":"Damage to the nervous system can occur because of accidental or iatrogenic trauma, toxins, infection, metabolic disorders, and even normal ageing. The consequences can outweigh the direct effects of the injury. Almost all injury to the nervous system results in loss of nerve cells and consequently modified sensation and movement. Nerve damage may also be followed by sensory disturbances, ranging from tingling, numbness and abnormal temperature sensations to spontaneous pain, allodynia (painful sensations from light touch) or hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to a damaging stimulus). Some of these symptoms are encountered in older people as they lose sensory neurones. The problems are chronic and most are intractable to drugs. This project will clarify how immune-mediated inflammation of dorsal root (sensory) ganglia (DRGs) contributes to these sequelae. Even the simplest form of neural damage following peripheral nerve injury can produce changes in regions of the nervous system far from the parts directly involved in the injury. Our recent work has described for the first time the involvement of the immune system in triggering changes in DRGs following transection of a distant peripheral nerve in rats. T-cell activation leads to invasion of macrophages and production of proinflammatory cytokines. These substances can activate sensory neurones and may be responsible for progressive neuronal death. Thus we have established a simple system in which we can evaluate the influx of T-cells and macrophages of different kinds into DRGs after injury and other insults. We intend to use this to define the sequence of cellular events involved in recruitment of immune cells and compare it with other experimental interventions known to produce a neuroimmune response in this system. This will identify whether the DRG is a special site for neuroimmune interactions and so should be a target for therapy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Elspeth Mclachlan","data":{"first_name":"Elspeth","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044182","middle_name":"Mary","last_name":"Mclachlan","source_individual_id":"RMIS109979","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Elspeth Mclachlan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88452","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Anne Cunningham","data":{"first_name":"Anne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030200","middle_name":"Marie","last_name":"Cunningham","source_individual_id":"RMIS221249","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Anne Cunningham"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84825","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4006","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of action of neurochemicals and modulators in human intestine: changes in disease","data":{"media_summary":"ulcerative colitis","end_year":2005,"keywords":["autonomic ganglia","muscarinic receptors","neurotensin","receptors","smooth muscle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222739,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["bowel contractions","diverticulitis","inflammatory bowel disease","slow transit constipation","ulcerative colitis"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of action of neurochemicals and modulators in human intestine: changes in disease","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Elizabeth Burcher","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/222739","simplified_title":"Control of intestinal function in health and disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"442500","source_system":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and idiopathic chronic constipation (ICC) are two serious gastrointestinal disorders, for which no effective medical treatment is known.

It is caused by the degeneration of specific nerve cells in the brain that produce certain chemcials and patients suffer from an inability to move fluently (or ultimately at all). At present we do not know what triggers this neurodegeneration. Current symptomatic treatments give sufferers some relief for a period of time by boosting the amount of these depleted chemicals in the brain. However, the underlying cellular degeneration continues unabated until such treatments are no longer effective. It is necessary to determine the reason for the cell loss in the brain in order to develop successful long-term treatments for this disabling disorder. There have been a number of animal models for PD developed. Comparing the type of tissue damage associated with the cell loss in these models shows that signs of brain inflammation occur prior to the loss of nerve cells. This feature consistently occurs regardless of the method used to produce the disease model. However, inflammation has been poorly studied in PD. Part of the present proposal is to analyse the brain tissue from patients with PD in order to document whether inflammation is also a consistent feature in the regions affected by the disease. Other central nervous system disorders in which inflammation is thought to play a pivotal role often have some genetic predisposition to the disorder and there is evidence of an immune response in their blood. We also wish to examine these aspects in patients with PD. Overall, our study will provide the necessary evidence for or against a primary role for inflammation in the disease process causing the ongoing degeneration in PD. If significant indications for a primary role for inflammation are found, treatments specifically targeting inflammation (already available) can be trialled to slow or stop the neurodegeneration."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glenda Halliday","data":{"first_name":"Glenda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019412","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Halliday","source_individual_id":"RMIS4337831","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Glenda Halliday"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81939","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Dominic Rowe","data":{"first_name":"Dominic","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009988","middle_name":"Brock","last_name":"Rowe","source_individual_id":"RMIS1117671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Dominic Rowe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79413","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4003","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Atherosclerosis:Lipoproteins, cell biology and vascular physiology","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Cholesterol Metabolism","Lipoproteins","Macrophage","Oxidative Stress","Vascular Biology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":222722,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Atherosclerosis:Lipoproteins, cell biology and vascular physiology","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

patented new platform vaccine technology (scrambled antigen vaccine or SAVINE) designed to encode all the protein sequences of an infectious agent, in this case HIV-1. These are arranged as equal-sized, overlapping fragments such that all potential T cell epitopes that are needed to induce broad T-cell-mediated immunity are maintained. The synthetically designed vaccine uses consensus sequences of HIV-1 to provide universal coverage of the major HIV-1 strains for a global population. The synthetic systematically designed HIV-1 vaccine will be delivered using our newly developed prime-boost immunisation regime that induces particularly high levels of cell-mediated immunity."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John

particular type of receptor on the surface of immune cells that participates in our response to infection. CD4 is also the primary receptor for the HIV virus which causes AIDS. We have discovered that a particular type of chemistry is occurring in CD4. This chemistry, which is known as redox chemistry, changes the shape of CD4. The shape change appears to be controlled by the immune cell. We have suggested that the redox chemistry in CD4 is important for controlling how immune cells respond to infection and how the HIV virus infects immune cells. Moreover, we have designed a small synthetic compound that blocks the redox chemistry in CD4 and prevents HIV infection in the test tube. We propose to investigate how the redox chemistry in CD4 controls the function of immune cells and infection by HIV."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Joseph Altin","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035078","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Altin","source_individual_id":"RMIS52794","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Joseph Altin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86089","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Hogg","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002233","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hogg","source_individual_id":"5012741","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philip Hogg"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77286","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3408","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of collagenase (MMP-1) in the pathogenesis of human pterygia","data":{"media_summary":"ocular surface disease","end_year":2004,"keywords":["cornea","enzyme expression","genetic polymorphism","matrix metalloproteinase","uv radiation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209635,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["aboriginal health","disease mechanisms","environmental health issues","genetic predisposition to disease","ocular surface disease"],"scientific_title":"The role of collagenase (MMP-1) in the pathogenesis of human pterygia","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Ophthalmology and Vision Science","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Nick Di Girolamo","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209635","simplified_title":"Eye disease caused by an enzyme","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"246100","source_system":"Pterygia are a common, recurrent, disfiguring, and sight-threatening disease of the human eye. This disease is extremely common world wide and particularly in the Australian aboriginal population. The triggers for this disease are unknown. Prolonged exposure to environmental elements, such as ultra violet (UV) light, is proposed to be the main initiating factor. Our previous studies have shown the important role played by a family of proteolytic enzymes (metalloproteinases) in the progressive and invasive nature of pterygia. We have significant preliminary evidence that a large percentage of patients with pterygia carry a mutation in one of these enzymes (collagenase-1). This is the most abundant enzyme expressed in pterygium tissue and probably plays a major role in invasion and progression in this disease. UV light activates cells in pterygia to induce expression of collagenase-1. This study will determine whether or not people with a genetic predisposition are more likely to develop pterygia and whether or not environmental factors, such as UV light, trigger progression of disease. If this is the case, then subjects with this genetic predisposition would be at increased risk for the development of pterygia (and their complications) and could be advised to take preventative measures to minimize the risk of developing this disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Denis Wakefield","data":{"first_name":"Denis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022778","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wakefield","source_individual_id":"RMIS72560","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Denis Wakefield"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82868","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anne Turner","data":{"first_name":"Anne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016741","middle_name":"Isabella","last_name":"Turner","source_individual_id":"RMIS150986","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Anne Turner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81249","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Minas Coroneo","data":{"first_name":"Minas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012492","middle_name":"Theodore","last_name":"Coroneo","source_individual_id":"RMIS72563","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Minas Coroneo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80075","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Nick Di Girolamo","data":{"first_name":"Nick","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0001273","middle_name":"","last_name":"Di Girolamo","source_individual_id":"RMIS6903664","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Nick Di Girolamo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77019","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3407","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Reseach Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Aging","Balance","Exercise therapy","Falls","Injury prevention"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209633,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Reseach Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Stephen Lord","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209633","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Reseach Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"610500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Lord","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038138","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lord","source_individual_id":"RMIS5224","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Lord"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86883","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3406","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Peripheral mechanisms involved in autonomic hyperreflexia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Neurovascular mechanism","Spinal cord injury","Sympathetic nervous system","Vascular reactivity","Vascular smooth muscle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209632,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Autonomic nervous system disease","Control of blood pressure","Spinal cord injury"],"scientific_title":"Peripheral mechanisms involved in autonomic hyperreflexia","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autonomic Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr James Brock","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209632","simplified_title":"Do changes in the neural control of blood vessels contribute to autonomic hyperreflexia?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"229917.44","source_system":"Bladder distension or minor unheeded injuries below the lesion in spinally injured people often lead to episodes of high blood pressure that may cause stroke or death. These events require emergency hospitalization and are expensive as well as dangerous. After spinal injury, the control of sympathetic nerves that supply arteries and regulate blood pressure is lost. However, the nerves below the injury remain in place and the spinal cord below the lesion contains connections that can activate them. Signals from the bladder or skin enter the remaining lower part of the spinal cord and activate the sympathetic supply generating a rise in blood pressure. This project will test the hypothesis that increased sensitivity of arteries to the chemicals released from the sympathetic nerves leads to excessive vessel constriction, contributing to the exaggerated increase in pressure. We will investigate arteries removed from rats with experimental spinal transection. We will test the contractions of the arteries (a) to sympathetic nerve stimulation and (b) to the chemicals noradrenaline, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and neuropeptide Y that are normally released during nerve activity. We will determine whether release of noradrenaline and ATP from nerves is normal or augmented using electrochemical and electrophysiological techniques. We will compare the responses with those in normal arteries, those in arteries whose nerves have been silenced by removing all connections from the spinal cord and those in arteries that have lost all their nerve supply. This will enable us to identify whether the mechanisms for release of transmitter substances are modified and whether the arterial muscle is hypersensitive to these substances. The results will help in the design of safer treatment for these potentially lethal emergencies in spinal patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr James Brock","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023792","middle_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Brock","source_individual_id":"5013635","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr James Brock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83112","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3405","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Transcriptional regulation of the tumour suppressor gene, retinoic acid receptor beta","data":{"media_summary":"transcription","end_year":2004,"keywords":["neuroblastoma","retinoids","transcriptional regulation","tumour suppressor gene"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209620,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cancer biology","cancer therapy","neuroblastoma","paediatric oncology","transcription"],"scientific_title":"Transcriptional regulation of the tumour suppressor gene, retinoic acid receptor beta","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Glenn Marshall","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209620","simplified_title":"A study of factors regulating the gene expression of an anti-oncogene","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"336540","source_system":"Cancer is still the second commonest cause of death in children.

In previous studies we have identified that a particular gene retinoic acid receptor beta, known to be involved in the vitamin A anticancer effect may be deficient in some neuroblastoma tumours, and is vital to the anticancer effect of vitamin A in neuroblastoma cells.

Grant","total_budget":"241980","source_system":"The aim of the project is to understand how some blood clotting factors may be involved with the regulation of the extracellullar matrix (the material that exists between cells) and angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation). New blood vessel growth occurs in a wide variety of situations including: healing of a flesh wound, the healing phase following a heart attack, development of the eye disease associated with sugar diabetes, in and around a cancerous growth, in the uterus during the normal menstrual cycle, and for the normal growth and development of the placenta and a new baby. The processes by which these new blood vessels form and the factors contributing to the maintenance of their structure are incompletely understood. However, it is known that the interaction of cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix is critical for normal cell function and in particular for new blood vessel formation. Studies in this project will seek to define a relationship between some of the factors which regulate blood clotting, and those that regulate turnover of the extracellular matrix and new blood vessel formation. In particular, how blood clotting factors may be invovled in the regulation of the extracellular matrix will be studied in a rapidly developing tissue, the mouse placenta. The role of blood clotting factors in regulation of new blood vessel formation into an artificial avascular tissue will also be examined. These studies will employ some of the new genetic techniques to understand new roles for proteins which have been traditionally thought to act in only one way. This research has the potential to provide new insights into how blood vessels are formed and are subsequently maintained. This increased understanding will provide the knowledge required for the development of new therapeutic strategies to correct the process when it goes wrong, is unwanted or underdeveloped in human disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jonathan Erlich","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007164","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Erlich","source_individual_id":"RMIS582218","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Jonathan Erlich"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3402","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Downregulation of N-myc oncogene expression as a therapeutic strategy for childhood neuroblastoma.","data":{"media_summary":"Paediatric Oncology","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Antisense oligonucleotide","Catalytic DNA","Neuroblastoma","Oncogene","Paediatric oncology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209600,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Cancer Treatment","Childhood Malignancy","Neuroblastoma","Paediatric Oncology"],"scientific_title":"Downregulation of N-myc oncogene expression as a therapeutic strategy for childhood neuroblastoma.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michelle Haber","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209600","simplified_title":"Switching off a cancer-associated gene as a treatment for the childhood cancer, neuroblastoma.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"145990","source_system":"Neuroblastoma is a common cancer of young children which, despite the use of powerful anticancer drugs that cure other childhood cancers, has only a 40% survival rate. Many laboratories have shown that the most aggressive neuroblastoma tumours, which are most resistant to the action of anticancer drugs, have an abnormal number of copies of a cancer-associated gene, called N-myc. Patients whose tumours have multiple N-myc copies have dismal survival prospects, and new treatments for such patients are urgently needed. Several studies, using models of neuroblastoma cells growing in the laboratory, have shown that it is possible to create small fragments of genetic material which can specifically switch off the N-myc gene. When this happens, the neuroblastoma cells behave in a less aggressive and malignant way. We have recently shown that these genetic fragments are capable of reducing the growth of tumours in mice which have been genetically manipulated to develop neuroblastoma. We now want to develop new types of genetic fragments (DNAzymes) that will be even more effective at switching off N-myc and inhibiting neuroblastoma development, because these fragments may be extremely valuable for treating neuroblastoma in patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Murray Norris","data":{"first_name":"Murray","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027063","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Norris","source_individual_id":"RMIS147223","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Murray Norris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84000","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Levon Khachigian","data":{"first_name":"Levon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020094","middle_name":"Michael","last_name":"Khachigian","source_individual_id":"RMIS227494","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Levon Khachigian"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82125","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michelle Haber","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001974","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haber","source_individual_id":"RMIS147226","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michelle Haber"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77205","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3401","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The use of Minimal Residual Disease detection to improve treatment outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","data":{"media_summary":"prognostic indicators","end_year":2004,"keywords":["bone marrow","genetic polymorphisms","leukaemia","paediatric oncology","polymerase chain reaction (PCR)"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209599,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cancer detection, therapy and prevention","molecular diagnosis","paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","paediatric haematology","prognostic indicators"],"scientific_title":"The use of Minimal Residual Disease detection to improve treatment outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Murray Norris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209599","simplified_title":"Improving the outcome of childhood leukaemia by monitoring the presence of residual leukaemia cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"316650","source_system":"Leukaemia is the most common childhood cancer, representing approximately 35% of all cases. Despite intensive therapy, the disease frequently recurs in the bone marrow and although children are classified into good and poor prognosis groups at diagnosis based on a number of criteria, relapses nevertheless occur in both groups. Available evidence suggests that early detection of poor treatment response in the otherwise good prognosis group, and the implementation of alternative therapy when the cancer burden is at a low level, has a high likelihood of improving patient survival. The failure to respond well to treatment is assessed by a novel molecular genetic technique developed in our laboratory that can detect and quantitate very low levels of residual leukaemia with great sensitivity and specificity. The major goal of this project is to conduct a clinical trial in which this testing procedure is used at an early stage of treatment, and patients who have a bad result on this test, will be given more intensive treatment to see if this improves survival rates. In addition, the project is also directed towards investigating a range of genes known to have a role in drug detoxification. A number of naturally occurring variations exist for these drug metabolising genes and there is evidence suggesting that specific variations or patterns may influence a cancer's response to treatment. We will therefore examine the genetic patterns present in a large cohort of leukaemias and correlate these patterns with response to treatment. It is anticipated that these studies will help define the most appropriate treatment strategies for children with leukaemia. This project therefore has major implications for the therapeutic management of children with leukaemia and has the potential of contributing directly to the improved survival of this most common of childhood cancers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glenn Marshall","data":{"first_name":"Glenn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032350","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"Marshall","source_individual_id":"5012634","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Glenn Marshall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85375","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Murray Norris","data":{"first_name":"Murray","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027063","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Norris","source_individual_id":"RMIS147223","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Murray Norris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84000","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michelle Haber","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001974","middle_name":"","last_name":"Haber","source_individual_id":"RMIS147226","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michelle Haber"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77205","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3400","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"B-1 B cells as a source of polyreactive IgE antibodies, in allergic individuals","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["B lymphocyte","allergy","cytokines","flow cytometry","isotype switching"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209590,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["allergic diseases and atopy","immune dysfunction","immune regulation"],"scientific_title":"B-1 B cells as a source of polyreactive IgE antibodies, in allergic individuals","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Allergy","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Andrew Collins","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209590","simplified_title":"The role of unconventional (B-1) B cells in the allergic response","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"331320","source_system":"Allergic disease results from the actions of antibody molecules that are produced by cells called B cells. Over the last fifteen years, it has been realised that there are at least two B cell subsets, called B-1 and B-2 cells. The B-1 cells and their antibody products have many unusual features, and they have been implicated in some disease processes. We have recently completed studies that strongly suggest that B-1 B cells may play an important role in some allergic disease. We wish to compare groups of patients defined according to their allergic conditions and age, to see whether B-1 B cell activity is associated with particular allergic diseases. We hypothesise that patients with allergic skin conditions have raised numbers of allergy-inducing B-1 cells. Such patients will be compared with those with allergies to inhalent allergens and others with food allergies. Studies will be performed in adult groups as well as in children, for B-1 B cell numbers are known to vary with age. As most of our understanding of the regulation of B cell function, in the context of allergic disease, has arisen from studies conducted with conventional B-2 cells, we also wish to reconsider aspects of B cell regulation. We are specifically interested in the regulation of the 'switching' of B-1 B cells, when they change from the production of antibodies of a 'non-allergic' type (IgM antibodies) to allergy-promoting IgE antibodies. We wish to determine whether the B-1 B cells of allergic individuals are particularly susceptible to such switching, when under the influence of regulatory molecules called cytokines. We expect that B-1 B cells will be associated with some, though not all allergic conditions, and that these cells will emerge as a new target for therapies. Such a finding would be most important. The development of new therapies will require a better understanding of the regulation of these cells, and this will be another important outcome of this project."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"William Sewell","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0045360","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sewell","source_individual_id":"RMIS138628","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"William Sewell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88734","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Collins","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024202","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Collins","source_individual_id":"5014000","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Collins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83215","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3399","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Enhancing Treatment Effectiveness in Acute Stress Disorder","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Anxiety disorder","Clinical psychology","Cognitive behaviour","Posttraumatic stress disorder"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209588,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Acute and chronic anxiety reactions","Anxiety disorders","Mental health","Posttraumatic stress disorder"],"scientific_title":"Enhancing Treatment Effectiveness in Acute Stress Disorder","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Richard Bryant","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209588","simplified_title":"Treatment of Acute Stress Disorder","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"235330","source_system":"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most common psychiatric condition to develop after trauma.

Although cognitive behaviour therapy of acute stress disorder can effectively prevent PTSD in many cases, many people do not benefit from this treatment because this treatment involves exposure to distressing memories and emotions, and this contributes to many people dropping out of treatment. This project aims to extend the utility of early intervention following trauma by assessing approaches that can be used by most trauma survivors. The project compares early intervention with either exposure, cognitive therapy, combined exposure and cognitive therapy, or supportive counseling. All therapy will be conducted in the initial four weeks and will comprise 6 sessions. Assessments will be conducted posttreatment, six-months follow-up, and one-year follow-up.

Finding ways to treat paraplegia is a major goal of neuroscience research. Recently, there has been considerable interest in a special cell found in the olfactory system, the ensheathing cell, which has been found to support regeneration in the spinal cord. Our laboratory has shown that injection of these ensheathing cells into the completely cut spinal cord of adult rats can lead to limited functional recovery of hindlimb movement. We used peripheral ensheathing cells because, in humans, such cells can be obtained relatively easily and they reduce problems of tissue rejection. We found that peripheral cells are as effective as previous reports using central ensheathing cells. Our overall aim now is to advance towards the use of olfactory cells in human spinal cord injury, by trialing 3 procedures of clinical relevance: a) to test whether human olfactory cells can also support functional recovery in rats. Human cells can be obtained from the nose by a simple biopsy procedure. If they able to support regeneration, this will open the way for their use in autografts in human paraplegia. b) to delay the time when the olfactory cells are applied to the injured cord. At present, neurosurgeons are not be willing to treat the cord immediately after the injury, because of the risk of causing further damage. This trial is designed to test whether delayed treatment is still effective. c) to test the effectiveness of the cells after bruising, rather than cutting, the cord. Bruising is a more common type of injury in people, hence it is necessary to know how these cells respond to this type of damage. These procedures have been chosen to move our basic research closer to clinical application. Although treatment in humans is still a long way off, these basic studies are essential if conditions like paraplegia are eventually to become treatable."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Francois Feron","data":{"first_name":"Francois","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0036587","middle_name":"","last_name":"Feron","source_individual_id":"RMIS227375","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Francois Feron"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86488","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Stephen Ho","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0019641","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ho","source_individual_id":"RMIS221332","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Stephen Ho"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82005","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Phil Waite","data":{"first_name":"Phil","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0010878","middle_name":"","last_name":"Waite","source_individual_id":"RMIS145719","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Phil Waite"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79664","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Mackay-Sim","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003102","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mackay-Sim","source_individual_id":"RMIS222290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alan Mackay-Sim"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77528","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3397","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"MEDICAL EARLY RESPONSE INTERVENTION AND THERAPY (MERIT): A RANDOMISED CLINICAL TRIAL","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Cardiac arrests","Emergency treatment","Iatrogenic injuries","In-hospital adverse events","Quality of health care"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209578,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Admission to intensive care unit","Cardiac arrest","Death and preventable death"],"scientific_title":"MEDICAL EARLY RESPONSE INTERVENTION AND THERAPY (MERIT): A RANDOMISED CLINICAL TRIAL","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Kenneth Hillman","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209578","simplified_title":"EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MEDICAL EMERGENCY TEAM: A RANDOMISED CLINICAL TRIAL","sub_type":"Clinical Trial/Large Scale","total_budget":"530500","source_system":"Every year, between 12,000 and 23,000 deaths are associated with in-hospital adverse events, making them one of the leading causes of death in the general population. These adverse events lost Australia over three million bed-days per year, and cost the country up to $4.7 billion every year. Among the adverse events, death, cardiac arrest and unplanned admissions to intensive care unit (ICU) are the most serious occurrences. The majority of the events were preceded by serious clinical deterioration, which can be easily identified. Recognising these problems, a hospital-wide intervention system called the Medical Emergency Team (MET) has been developed in Australia over the last 10 years. Under this system, when a patient's clinical condition is unstable, a call is immediately placed to the MET for intervention. Preliminary data have shown that the MET can reduce in-hospital deaths, cardiac arrests and unplanned ICU admissions. However, past studies have been based on observational design and their results lack scientific credence due to uncontrolled confounders and biases. It is proposed to conduct a multi-centre randomised clinical trial to test the hypothesis that the implementation of the hospital-wide MET system will reduce the aggregate incidence of the following three adverse events: unplanned admissions to intensive care units, cardiopulmonary arrest, and in-hospital death. The study will involve 20 Australian and New Zealand hospitals, each with at least 20,000 admissions per year. This study will provide crucial scientific evidence for health managers and governments to make decision on the implementation of MET in Australian and New Zealand hospitals. If the MET system is shown to reduce adverse events as observed in preliminary studies, then the introduction of MET could save approximately 4000 lives, avoid 1500 cardiac arrests, and prevent 2500 unplanned ICU admissions every year."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Finfer","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042375","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Finfer","source_individual_id":"5014607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Simon Finfer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87993","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Gordon Doig","data":{"first_name":"Gordon","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024563","middle_name":"Stuart","last_name":"Doig","source_individual_id":"RMIS1138115","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Gordon Doig"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83301","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kenneth Hillman","data":{"first_name":"Kenneth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019626","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"Hillman","source_individual_id":"RMIS3917","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kenneth Hillman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82000","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rinaldo Bellomo","data":{"first_name":"Rinaldo","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017677","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bellomo","source_individual_id":"5012506","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Rinaldo Bellomo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81516","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Tuan Nguyen","data":{"first_name":"Tuan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015245","middle_name":"V","last_name":"Nguyen","source_individual_id":"RMIS1132608","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Tuan Nguyen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80835","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3396","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Increased vulnerability to stress during opiate dependence: Molecular, anatomical, and behavioural correlates","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["drug addiction","fear","hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis","molecular neuroscience","stress"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209577,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["addiction","addiction treatment","mental health","stress response"],"scientific_title":"Increased vulnerability to stress during opiate dependence: Molecular, anatomical, and behavioural correlates","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Reginald Westbrook","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209577","simplified_title":"Stress and opiate addiction","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"272640","source_system":"Heroin addiction is a major health and societal problem in Australia.

It is a chronically relapsing condition for which few, if any effective prevention and treatment strategies exist. Moreover, why an individual initiates and maintains heroin taking remains unclear. Stress and negative emotions have a strong impact on heroin use. Stress may drive some individuals to start using heroin, stress increases the pleasurable effects of heroin and stress increases the aversive effects of heroin withdrawal. These effects will encourage addiction and discourage addicts from seeking treatment. Stress can also cause an otherwise drug-free individual to relapse to heroin addiction despite having been drug-free for some time. In this project we will study why stress has such a large impact on heroin addicts and heroin addiction. We will test the hypothesis that heroin use actually produces profound alterations in the neural network in the brain which controls responses to stress. This project uses a simple animal model of heroin addiction whereby rats are injected with morphine to study the regulation of several genes which are important in responding to stress. We will also study how this exposure and changes in gene expression alter neurobiological, cardiovascular, and behavioural responses to stress. This project will identify parts of the brain that are altered during heroin addiction, and will also identify why heroin addicts are more vulnerable to stress than the general population.

Whether there are individual differences in response to the different components of the treatment or whether there is a single most potent component is of considerable theoretical interest.

Our group was the first to identify and characterise a new class of chloride channel which plays a key roles in the regulation of the immune system. These channels are unusual in that they can move between two states: a soluble state and a state that resides in the cell membrane. We have determined the first structure of this class of channel in the soluble state. In this project, we will determine: how the protein makes the transition into the membrane state; which factors control this transition; and the structure of the protein in the membrane state. We will also determine how several drugs control the activity of this channel. The results of our work will have specific implications for our channel and will serve as a paradigm for other members of this new class of chloride channel.

The presence of this pigment is thought to play a role in the death of these cells. Evidence from many different diseases has demonstrated that a type of cell damage called oxidative damage is caused by an increase in tissue iron levels. Iron levels are increased in the brains of persons who have died with Parkinson's disease but only in the part of the brain which contains neuromelanin. This increase in iron is thought to lead to oxidative damage and thus cell death in Parkinson's disease. Why iron should be increased specifically in this part of the brain is unknown but it has been shown that neuromelanin binds tissue iron and that the interaction between iron and neuromelanin can result in tissue damage. These events are suggested to underlie the specific vulnerability of the neuromelanin-containing cells in Parkinson's disease. However as yet very little is known about this pigment or how it interacts with iron. This research investigates neuromelanin in the normal brain and in the brain of persons who have died with Parkinson's disease. The project aims to demonstrate how neuromelanin interacts with iron and how neuromelanin, both in the presence and absence of iron, can influence oxidative cell damage. The use of human neuromelanin makes this research unique and it will provide important and novel information regarding the role of this pigment in the aetiology of this devastating disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Kay Double","data":{"first_name":"Kay","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024584","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Double","source_individual_id":"5014402","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Kay Double"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83307","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3390","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel mechanisms in regulating cytokine secretion in the inflammatory response","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["cytokine secretion","ion channels","macrophage","proteasome and protein degradation","protein folding/trafficking in secretion"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209521,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","chronic inflammatory disease","rheumatoid arthritis"],"scientific_title":"Novel mechanisms in regulating cytokine secretion in the inflammatory response","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Asne Bauskin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209521","simplified_title":"Regulation of cytokine secretion in macrophages","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"323160","source_system":"Macrophages are key cells in the immune and inflammatory response. They play a role in many biological processes including wound healing and resistance to tumours and infections. It is also a major cell involved in mediating inflammation and tissue damage in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The macrophage's role in these processes is achieved in large part by secreting enzymes and other proteins called cytokines to the outside of the cell. These cytokines are synthesized by the macrophage and travel through a secretory pathway in the cell, in order to be released to the outside of the cell. There are various quality control mechanisms along the pathway which ensure only correctly made functional protein is secreted out of the cell. One cytokine, called macrophage inhibitory cytokine is produced by the immune cells called macrophages only when they become activated to mount an immune response against invading pathogens. The cell uses a novel mechanism to ensure the quality control of this cytokine. The propeptide of this cytokine targets incorrectly folded cytokine to a protein complex called the proteasome for degradation. This prevents secretion of inactive cytokine. Additionally, the propeptide of the cytokine helps secretion from macrophages by a novel mechanism. Because of these characteristics the cytokine provides a good model to study secretion from macrophages under pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions. In addition, demonstrating that activation of the macrophages causes a major upregulation in the synthesis and secretion of cytokines by novel mechanisms, will further our understanding of how the macrophage operates in fulfilling its role in the immune response."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Asne Bauskin","data":{"first_name":"Asne","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0023536","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bauskin","source_individual_id":"RMIS132420","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Asne Bauskin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83050","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3389","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Health-Related Quality of Life in Intractable Paediatric Epilepsy: Using a New Measure to Improve Management","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Cognitive function assessment","Epilepsy","Health outcomes","Quality of life"],"nhmrc_grant_id":209512,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Cognitive deficits","Epilepsy surgery","Intractable epilepsy syndromes","Quality of life"],"scientific_title":"Health-Related Quality of Life in Intractable Paediatric Epilepsy: Using a New Measure to Improve Management","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Ann Bye","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/209512","simplified_title":"Quality of Life in Severe Childhood Epilepsy","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"252940","source_system":"Until recently there was no adequate measure to assess the quality of life of children with epilepsy.

We will determine if surgery in children stops seizures and improves quality of life. We also aim to find out if children with different types of epilepsies have unique quality of life issues. Finally, we aim to determine if the quality of a child's life depends on how well they are thinking and learning or how often they are having seizures. We will conduct this study in children with difficult epilepsy recruited from three major children's hospitals (Sydney Children's Hospital, the Children's Hospital, Westmead, Miami Children's Hospital, Florida USA) using a well designed methodology. Each child will have their particular type of epilepsy characterised using video and brain wave analysis. Each parent and older child will receive a quality of life package including the QOLCE to assess life function. In addition, all children will have an assessment of their thinking and learning by a child psychologist. At the completion of this project we will have established whether surgical treatment in children with epilepsy stops seizures and improves quality of life. This will allow clinicians and parents to better understand the effects of surgical treatment in this population. In addition, we will determine if problems in quality of life are associated with specific types of epilepsy. This information can be used to counsel families and tailor interventions and treatments.

National guidelines on surveillance and prophylactic strategies have recently been ratified. These are largely based on expert opinion. Because of the uncertain efficacy of ovarian cancer screening and the high mortality associated with ovarian cancer, prophylactic oophorectomy is considered an option for women at high risk. Decisions about optimal care are difficult for both women and their doctors. Efforts to improve services for women who are trying to make informed decisions about screening and prophylactic strategies under conditions of uncertainty must be informed by sound knowledge of the efficacy of educational interventions. Decision aids have been developed as adjuncts to practitioners' counselling to prepare patients for decision-making. The proposed randomised controlled trial will compare the efficacy of a general educational pamphlet and that of a tailored decision aid.

However, the experiments that have been designed to look at the function of this protein have looked at its function in the test tube. The exact role of Beta 2-GPI in the body, has not been determined. A way of looking at the function of this protein in the body would be if you eliminated the protein from an animal such as a mouse. By sophisticated molecular biology techniques we have been able to eliminate the gene for Beta 2-GPI in mice thus deriving mice that do not produce any Beta 2-GPI protein. These mice are called Beta 2-GPI knockout mice and are an ideal animal model to examine the function of Beta 2-GPI. Experiments outlined in this proposal will examine the role of Beta 2-GPI in clotting, atherosclerosis and the effect of production of antibodies to Beta 2-GPI in these animals. In addition, since current treatment of patients that have these antibodies consists of long term, sometimes lifelong, treatment with drugs that thin the blood which have potential side effects, we are investigating a novel treatment approach which is directed at eliminating the antibodies that bind Beta 2-GPI. If one could eliminate the antibody production to Beta 2-GPI by these patients there would not be a need for lifelong treatment with drugs such as heparin which thins the blood and there would thus be a reduction in the problems with these medications. To do this we have obtained a specialised chemically modified portion of Beta 2-GPI that has already been shown to work in preliminary experiments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Steven Krilis","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002742","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Krilis","source_individual_id":"RMIS545867","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Steven Krilis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77415","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3386","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Function of glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains in the macrophage foam cell","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["atherosceloris","glycosphingolipids","lipoprotein-receptor","macrophage","oxidised-LDL"],"nhmrc_grant_id":189990,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Function of glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains in the macrophage foam cell","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Carbohydrates","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"A/Pr Brett Garner","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/189990","simplified_title":"Function of glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains in the macrophage foam cell","sub_type":"Howard Florey Centenary ECF","total_budget":"164287.37","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brett Garner","data":{"first_name":"Brett","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013170","middle_name":"","last_name":"Garner","source_individual_id":"5014767","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Brett Garner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80256","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3087","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Control of the cholesterol esterification cycle in macrophages","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Atherosclerosis","Cholesterol metabolism","Enzyme regulation","Foam cell","Macrophage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":189750,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Angina","Atherosclerosis","Cardiovascular disease","Stroke"],"scientific_title":"Control of the cholesterol esterification cycle in macrophages","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Metabolism","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Wendy Jessup","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/189750","simplified_title":"What controls fat storage in heart disease?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"150660","source_system":"Atherosclerosis is the disease which narrows arteries and causes heart attacks.

In atherosclerotic arteries, cells called macrophages contain excess cholesterol in the form of cholesteryl ester droplets. It appears that human cells are very inefficient at clearing such cholesteryl esters, and this may explain why atherosclerosis is difficult to treat. In this proposal we will investigate how macrophages metabolise these cholesteryl esters and how this process can be stimulated. The results of this study should enable novel treatments of this serious condition to be developed."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wendy Jessup","data":{"first_name":"Wendy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031579","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jessup","source_individual_id":"RMIS97823","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wendy Jessup"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85174","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leonard Kritharides","data":{"first_name":"Leonard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008461","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kritharides","source_individual_id":"RMIS1108085","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leonard Kritharides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78986","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3085","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mitochondrial iron overload and Friedreich's ataxia: The role of frataxin in iron and haem metabolism","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Friedreich's ataxia","iron chelators","iron metabolism","neurodegenerative disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":189720,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["iron levels","neurological disease","therapeutics"],"scientific_title":"Mitochondrial iron overload and Friedreich's ataxia: The role of frataxin in iron and haem metabolism","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Des Richardson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/189720","simplified_title":"Freidreich's ataxia and iron metabolism","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"285990","source_system":"Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is due to the lack of a protein known as frataxin. Recent studies using Baker's yeast have shown that the deletion of frataxin results in the accumulation of toxic iron in the mitochondrion. More recently, a variety of studies have shown that FA patients have iron loading within their cells. The iron build-up may cause severe damage. At present, the role of frataxin in mammalian mitochondrial iron metabolism is unknown. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that frataxin is down-regulated by either erythroid differentiation or the haem precursor protoporphyrin IX (Becker and Richardson, submitted). These data strongly suggest a role for frataxin in iron metabolism. In the present study we will continue to assess if frataxin plays a role in the way cells handle iron. Using a unique model of mitochondrial iron overload developed in my lab (Richardson et al. (1996) BLOOD 87:3477), we will extensively investigate the iron metabolism of the mitochondrion in order to determine the function of frataxin and its role in Friedreich's ataxia. In addition, we have developed a series of new drugs known as iron chelators that can enter the mitochondrion due to their high lipid solubility (Becker and Richardson 1999 J. Lab. Clin. Med. 134:510). These latter drugs are far more effective than the chelator currently used to treat iron overload, desferrioxamine (DFO). Indeed, our chelators have been designed to result in high iron chelation efficacy but low toxicity (see Becker and Richardson, 1999). This exciting research may be crucial in understanding the development of FA and in creating new therapies such as the use of iron chelators."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Des Richardson","data":{"first_name":"Des","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021702","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Richardson","source_individual_id":"5011194","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Des Richardson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82581","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Davies","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012636","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Davies","source_individual_id":"5014233","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Davies"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80123","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3083","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"isonicotinoyl hydrazone class","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["anti-tumour drugs","chelators","new targets for anti-cancer agents"],"nhmrc_grant_id":189710,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cancer","chemotherapy","pharmacology","therapeutics"],"scientific_title":"isonicotinoyl hydrazone class","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Des Richardson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/189710","simplified_title":"Potential anti-tumour agents","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"301320","source_system":"Iron is essential for the growth of all cells. Generally, cancer cells have a high iron requirement due to their rapid rate of proliferation. This makes them susceptible to the action of drugs called iron chelators that deplete cell iron. A wide variety of studies, including clinical trials in leukemia and neuroblastoma patients, have shown that the clinically used chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO), can have potent anti-tumour activity. Indeed, in an important clinical trial, a marked decrease in tumour burden was observed while there were no significant side effects, demonstrating an appreciable therapeutic index. However, DFO suffers from serious problems, including that it requires long infusions and does not readily penetrate cells. Further, in some cancer patients, DFO has shown little activity. Considering these results, we have developed a new group of chelators that show far greater activity than DFO at inhibiting cancer cell growth. These studies have been published in high quality journals such as BLOOD (Richardson et al. 1995, 1997, 1999) and form the basis for the current study. In this study we will examine how these iron-binding drugs work to inhibit the growth of cancer cells compared to their normal counterparts. These studies are important for the rational design of even more effective chelators. Recent studies in my lab have shown that our new chelators have far greater activity than a drug currently used to treat leukemia, known as hydroxyurea (HU). Our studies also show that the chelators act by a variety of mechanisms, explaining their greater activity than HU. Furthermore, we have shown that these chelators show significant anti-tumour activity in mice. The potential of this form of therapy has been confirmed by the entrance of the chelator, Triapine, into clinical trials (Vion Pharmaceuticals, USA). Our chelators are more effective than Triapine, thus, the present project is crucial for developing novel anti-tumour therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Des

Two hundred children (aged 7 - 12 years) who are admitted to hospital following a traumatic injury will be assessed for acute disorder within one month of the accident. They will be also be assessed for heart rate, blood pressure, memory patterns, and family responses during the initial assesment. Parents will also be assessed for their trauma reactions. All participants will be re-assessed at 6-months posttrauma, and again at 18-months posttrauma.

While much of this could have been prevented by effective control of Group A streptococcal skin infections, there is also evidence that the high susceptibility to end-stage renal disease is related to poor intrauterine development of the kidney as low- birth weight is a predisposing factor. Mothers, whose renal function is impaired, tend to have babies which are low birth weight. There is no knowledge about the effects of maternal renal dysfunction on development of the fetal kidney. We have recently developed an animal model in which we can study the effects of maternal renal dysfunction on the development of the kidney of her offspring. Human beings form 60% of the functional units (nephrons) in the kidney in the last trimester. Sheep, like human beings (and unlike rats), completely form all the nephrons that they will ever have, during intrauterine life. While the fetal kidneys play an essential role in the formation of amniotic fluid, regulation of fetal fluid and electrolyte homeostasis depends on maternal renal function via transplacental transfer. If maternal renal function is reduced, it is likely that the fetal kidneys will be exposed to a greater volume and solute load through transplacental equilibration. This may have a profund effect on renal development especially if coupled with an inadequate maternal diet and a high maternal salt intake. Under these conditions we predict that development of the fetal kidney will be impaired and renal capacity after birth, reduced. This means that the kidney will 'age' more rapidly. Thus the affected individual would be predisposed to renal disease in adult life. In our animal model we will study the effects and interactions of maternal renal insufficiency, poor fetal nutrition and a high maternal salt intake on fetal kidney development and function."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Eugenie Lumbers","data":{"first_name":"Eugenie","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032221","middle_name":"Ruth","last_name":"Lumbers","source_individual_id":"5016098","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"E/Pr Eugenie Lumbers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85340","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2723","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Motor patterns of colonic transit and pathophysiology of severe constipation.","data":{"media_summary":"Treatment","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Colon","Motility","Pathophysiology","Pharmacology","Physiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157134,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Diagnosis","Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Obstructed Defaecation","Slow transit Constipation","Treatment"],"scientific_title":"Motor patterns of colonic transit and pathophysiology of severe constipation.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ian Cook","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157134","simplified_title":"Colonic function in health and disease.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196018.36","source_system":"This project aims to clarify the contractile patterns of the human colon which underlie the very common and distressing condition of constipation.

The need for measures to prevent the spread of HCV is based on the clinical implications of infection combined with its current prevalence and predicted spread within Australia. More than 200,000 Australians are estimated to be living with hepatitis C infection. Around 11,000 new HCV infections per year are estimated to occur across the Australia. HCV is spread through blood to blood exposure. In the absence of effective medical treatment for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) education about modes of transmission presents as the most viable means of containing the spread of the virus. The promotion of blood awareness has been identified as a key strategy for such education as it may ensure greater care on the part of the general community in the prevention of blood exposures. However, the development of a heightened awareness of blood as a source of infection is fraught with social and health implications. A crucial concern for those directly involved in promoting blood awareness is the need to ensure that such a strategy does not contribute to the already existing stigmatisation of those living with HCV or, more generally, promote irrational phobias about blood.

It is a new technique that has been demonstrated to have some potential as a treatment of depressive illness and possibly other neuropsychiatric disorders. At this early stage of its investigation, the parameters of stimulation that are most likely to be therapeutic, and its mechanisms of action, are not known. Published studies vary in the frequency, duration and extent of stimulation, with no firm guidelines about optimal parameters. Empirical study of the relative effects of stimulation at different frequencies, at different numbers of stimuli and for different durations is therefore important for the future development of this treatment. Such an investigation is best carried out in an animal model of depression for both ethical and practical reasons, as such studies in patients would possibly take many years and be extremely difficult to conduct. We propose such a study in rat models of depression which have demonstrated validity and utility in drug research. Rat models have a long track record in developing psychiatric treatments and are cost-effective and of proven value. We also plan to investigate the neuroanatomy of the immediate-early genes induced by TMS and compare it with electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and a tricyclic antidepressant, two established treatments of depression. The results will have implications for future human studies in guiding us toward the optimal parameters for therapeutic effects. They will also enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of TMS in depression."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Perminder Sachdev","data":{"first_name":"Perminder","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016022","middle_name":"Singh","last_name":"Sachdev","source_individual_id":"5012216","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Perminder Sachdev"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81041","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Colleen Loo","data":{"first_name":"Colleen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014540","middle_name":"","last_name":"Loo","source_individual_id":"5011846","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Colleen Loo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80633","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2720","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"RISK AND PROTECTION FACTORS FOR NORMAL AND ABNORMAL BRAIN AGEING: A LONGITUDINAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MRI STUDY","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Ageing","Brain reserve","Cognitive impairment","Magnetic resonance imaging","White matter lesions"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157125,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Ageing","Cognitive impairment","Dementia","Depression"],"scientific_title":"RISK AND PROTECTION FACTORS FOR NORMAL AND ABNORMAL BRAIN AGEING: A LONGITUDINAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MRI STUDY","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Perminder Sachdev","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157125","simplified_title":"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF BRAINS IN THE ELDERLY","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"153020.9","source_system":"Brain is considered the last frontier of medicine, and ageing the major challenge to health care in the 21st century.

In this application, we propose to perform MRI scans and blood tests on a quarter (n-500) of the 60-64 sample to obtain an epidemiological sample for brain morphology. Not only will we be able to study changes in brain morphology over time, and relate it with cognitive function and psychiatric disorder, we will also be able to assess the role of risk and protection factors. We are particularly interested in brain reserve, dietary factors (anti-oxidants, omega 3, wine and folate) and drugs (anti-inflammatory drugs, hormone replacement and vitamin supplements) as protection factors, and hypertension, homocysteine levels, white matter lesions on MRI and low hippocampal volumes as risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia.

Urinary incontinence can cause severe distress and is a taboo subject, even though it affects 30-40% of women. Public figures speak out about their experiences with breast cancer or heart disease, but not about leakage of urine. Elderly people with incontinence are forced into nursing homes, with major costs to the community. Incontinence is a major clinical problem: although over 800 new patients per annum are seen at our Pelvic Floor Unit, the waiting time for a first appointment is 14-15 weeks. There are four main types of urine leakage: - stress incontinence (weak pelvic floor muscles); - overflow incontinence (seen in men with prostatic hypertrophy); - sensory urgency (frequent, uncomfortable desire to urinate); and - detrusor instability (bladder muscle spasms with leakage). We are primarily interested in detrusor instability and sensory urgency, which cause 35% of incontinence in general, but up to 85% of cases in the elderly. Patients suffer from an urgent desire to visit the toilet frequently, and may leak urine if they cannot reach the toilet quickly. Unlike stress incontinence, it cannot be corrected by pelvic floor surgery. Drug treatment is often unsuccessful, with many unacceptable side effects. In our research group, we have found that the sensory nerve which convey the sensation of bladder fullness, are overabundant and display increased amounts of neurochemicals. Our studies in isolated bladder muscle from these patients have shown abnormalities in responsiveness. Thus bladder from women with urge incontinence is resistant to drugs which abolish contraction in normal bladder. In this project we plan to find out why such changes occur. We will use new techniques to study bladder nerves and the receptors which convey the message to contract the bladder muscle."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Burcher","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035624","middle_name":"","last_name":"Burcher","source_individual_id":"RMIS221428","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Burcher"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86226","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kate Moore","data":{"first_name":"Kate","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009198","middle_name":"Hilda","last_name":"Moore","source_individual_id":"RMIS569063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kate Moore"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79199","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2717","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Procoagulant Expression in the Antiphospholipid Syndrome","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["C-Reactive Protein","Cell Culture","Inflammation","Monocytes","Tissue Factor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157101,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Antiphospholipid Syndrome","Autoimmune Diseases","Thrombosis"],"scientific_title":"Procoagulant Expression in the Antiphospholipid Syndrome","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pathology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof H Patrick McNeil","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157101","simplified_title":"Procoagulant Expression in the Antiphospholipid Syndrome","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"This study proposes to investigate how white blood cells contribute to clotting that occurs in patients with an immune disorder called the Antiphospholipid Syndrome.

Some of the most important of these proteins are hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (or HIF-1) and activator protein-1 (or AP-1). We have identified a novel target gene that is activated in hypoxia. This gene produces an enzyme, termed cytochrome P450 2J2, that acts on fatty acids which are present in cell membranes and converts them into molecules that control the flow of potassium and calcium ions into cells. Alterations in the flow of such ions into cells have been observed previously in hypoxia but the mechanism of this effect is unclear.

Yet we are remarkably ignorant of why the infection causes these different patterns of disease. This project aims to provide evidence to show that the very mechanism the bacterium has acquired to help it resist stomach acid and so live in the stomach, is responsible for these differences. I.e. The organism lives in different parts of the stomach due to differences in local acid at that site. If the acid in a particular part of the stomach is too high, the acid resistance mechanism cannot cope. If the acid is too low, the organism also cannot grow well. Because the bacterium has evolved to only thrive in a relatively narrow range of acid, it will behave very differently in these different parts of the stomach. This results in different diseases. Various populations in different countries of the world have different levels of acid production and this also explains why in some countries duodenal ulcers predominate and in others gastric ulcer- gastric cancer is the norm. Showing why H. pylori lives where it lives will provide fundamental information relevant to understanding some of the world s major diseases and will also provides insights relevant to the design of new therapeutic approaches."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Adrian Lee","data":{"first_name":"Adrian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032010","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lee","source_individual_id":"RMIS117732","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Adrian Lee"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85280","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Hazel Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Hazel","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009157","middle_name":"Marjory","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"RMIS118549","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Hazel Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79187","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2712","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Opioids as a new therapy for inflammatory arthritis: Immunopharmacological mechanisms","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["chemokines and cytokines","human synovium","inflammopharmacology","opioids","rheumatoid arthritis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157080,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["drug treatment","inflammation","rheumatoid arthritis","therapeutic effects"],"scientific_title":"Opioids as a new therapy for inflammatory arthritis: Immunopharmacological mechanisms","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmacology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Judith Walker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157080","simplified_title":"Kappa opioids and arthritis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"406527.54","source_system":"Arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by joint pain, swelling and stiffness. In fact, 69% of patients present with radiographic erosions and joint space narrowing during the first three years of the disease and it is insufficiently appreciated that patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have a 5-year mortality similar to patients with cardiovascular or neoplastic disease. Prevention of disability and death is the ultimate goal of treatment. However, no cure is yet available. Instead, current treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and improving functional performance. There is now a growing recognition that patients with rheumatoid arthritis require more agressive treatment early in the disease, before the development of erosions and deformity. My work has shown for the first time that opioid drugs that act via kappa (k) receptors in the periphery are able to ameliorate the incidence and severity of disease symptoms in rat adjuvant arthritis. Histological and radiological analysis reveals a significant, beneficial effect on joint pathology. The present proposal seeks to build upon this basic information gained in rats into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of opioid action. I will now apply my expertise to extend this research in animals to human tissues. I am able to combine multiple techniques to carry out a systematic and rigorous study on human synovium from arthritis patients.

The protein is a natural component of the innate immune system and is regulated in cells by mediators of inflammation and infection. Our preliminary experiments indicate that this protein can activate mast cells. These cells reside in almost all body tissue and are located close to blood vessels and nerves. This location makes them prime targets to trigger vascular and inflammatory events. They are known to be important in allergy and infection and have a proposed role in chronic inflammatory processes. Although the mechanisms of mast cell activation contributing to acute responses in allergic reactions are well accepted, ways in which they are activated in asthma and other chronic inflammatory disease are virtually unknown. We will use lung biopsies from patients with asthma to detect patterns of expression of the protein and determine its effects on lung mast cells. A murine model will be used to define the characteristics of inflammation induced by the S100 protein and the role of mast cells in this process. Structural studies will define the parts of the protein necessary for mast cell activation. We will attempt to identify its receptor on mast cells to enable future studies to define how the protein triggers the cells to produce mediators such as histamine and those causing blood vessel changes. This knowledge could lead to design of novel drugs that could regulate this process. Results from this project will provide new knowledge of chronic inflammatory processes and could result in designing novel strategies to regulate these.

Syringomyelia causes pain and paralysis that usually does not improve even with treatment. The current lack of knowledge about the mechanism of spinal cord cyst formation and enlargement is preventing the development of effective therapy. We have previously shown that some types of spinal cord cysts enlarge by the normal fluid surrounding the spinal cord being pumped around small arteries into the centre of the spinal cord. The mechanism of enlargement of post-traumatic spinal cord cysts remains unknown, and this debilitating type of syringomyelia remains difficult to treat. Our hypothesis is that post-traumatic spinal cord cysts also enlarge by fluid being pumped into them around small arteries. A further hypothesis is that reductions of arterial pulsations and of the pressure in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord will prevent or inhibit cyst enlargement. These hypotheses will be tested by examining fluid flow in models of post-traumatic syringomyelia in rats and sheep. We have established a model of post-traumatic syringomyelia in rats and the first phase of the project will be to refine and characterize this model and to reproduce it in sheep. The second phase will be to determine whether these cysts enlarge by a flow of fluid around small arteries that is driven by arterial pulsations, as they do in other types of syringomyelia. The final phase will be to determine whether reducing the pressure in the fluid around the spinal cord prevents cyst enlargement. Confirmation that these techniques prevent cyst enlargement would open up new possibilities for the treatment of human syringomyelia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Nigel Jones","data":{"first_name":"Nigel","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0043354","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jones","source_individual_id":"RMIS11117","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Nigel Jones"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88232","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marcus Stoodley","data":{"first_name":"Marcus","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010473","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Stoodley","source_individual_id":"5011725","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Marcus Stoodley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79547","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2709","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of DNA Phosphate Crosslinking Agents as Potential Anticancer Drugs","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["3-Dimensional Structure of DNA-Drug Complexes","Anticancer Drug Discovery","Apoptosis and Repair of DNA Adducts","Cytoxicity and Antitumour Activity","DNA Phosphate Alkylation and Interstrand Crosslinking"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157061,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Carcinomas","Drug-resistant tumours","Leukaemias"],"scientific_title":"Development of DNA Phosphate Crosslinking Agents as Potential Anticancer Drugs","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Laurence Wakelin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157061","simplified_title":"Development of Novel DNA Binding Anticancer Drugs","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"392545.9","source_system":"The principal difficulty in the treatment of the common solid tumours that cause the majority of cancer deaths is the problem of drug resistance. For example, many patients with cancer of the lung, breast or colon respond well to drug treatment with their tumours initially regressing, only to return later in an aggressive drug-resistant form. In this event, the inevitable outcome is that the tumour grows through drug treatment and the patient eventually succumbs and dies. This is also a familiar scenario in the treatment of adults with leukaemias and non-Hodgkins lymphomas. The underlying cause of drug resistance is the genetic instability of cancer cells which results in tumours that are heterogeneous, making it almost inevitable that a cancer cell will arise that is resistant to treatment. There are many mechanisms of resistance, some of which are peculiar to particular drug types, some are permeability barriers and some involve genetic deregulation of the biochemistry of cell death. Alkylating agents are one of the most important classes of anticancer drug. They bind irreversibly to the bases in DNA and weld the two strands of the double helix together. This cross-link is a powerful block to DNA replication and leads to the death of cancer cells by the process of programmed cell death. Cancer cells generally become resistant to alkylating agents by invoking repair mechanisms that remove the drug from the DNA bases, a response which breaks the cross-link and returns the DNA to its normal state. In this project, we are developing a new type of alkylating agent that reacts not with the DNA bases but with the phosphate groups of the DNA backbone. By this means the strands of DNA can again be cross-linked but now the linkage is between parts of the DNA that cancer cells cannot separate. In this way, we hope to be able to devise new drugs that are resistant to the normal mechanisms of DNA repair so that they will be active against drug-resistant tumours."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Laurence Wakelin","data":{"first_name":"Laurence","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0022779","middle_name":"Patrick George","last_name":"Wakelin","source_individual_id":"RMIS5974866","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Laurence Wakelin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82869","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stewart Bernard","data":{"first_name":"Stewart","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011767","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bernard","source_individual_id":"RMIS2520816","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stewart Bernard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79885","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2708","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The structure - function relationship of NCC27, a novel nuclear chloride ion channel protein","data":{"media_summary":"therapy with biopharmaceuticals","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Ion channel","electrophysiology","membrane protein","mutagenesis","structure-function relationship"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157059,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","cancer","chronic inflammatory diseases","rheumatoid arthritis","therapy with biopharmaceuticals"],"scientific_title":"The structure - function relationship of NCC27, a novel nuclear chloride ion channel protein","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Samuel Breit","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157059","simplified_title":"NCC27 structure-function","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"241527.54","source_system":"Ion channels (IC) are complex proteins that regulate the transport of salts, an essential cell function.

The study follows patients from laboratory-documented infections with appropriate infective, immunological and psychological measures throughout the course of their acute illness, the early recovery period and for the next 12 months. These patients are compared with people who present to their doctor with other forms of medically-unexplained fatigue. Very few previous studies have used an appropriate prospective design and followed patients with documented illness from the onset through to the development of specific forms of chronic fatigue. Further, the study is unique in terms of the range of viral and non-viral agents being investigated. It relies on the combined psychiatric, immunological and infective disease expertise of a group of researchers with an international reputation for the successful completion of such multidisciplinary projects. The initial phase of the study has demonstrated that the research team has the capacity to complete this project. Initial results have already demonstrated the potential roles of psychological and immunological factors in causing some cases of prolonged fatigue. Further, the initial results indicate that two key symptom sets (fatigue, psychological distress) can be adequately measured during the recovery phase and are predicted by differing psychological factors. The study will result in the identification of different psychiatric risk factors to chronic fatigue, assist development of clear diagnostic guidelines for post-infective fatigue and guide relevant aetiological and treatment research."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ian Hickie","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043027","middle_name":"Bernard","last_name":"Hickie","source_individual_id":"5012235","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ian Hickie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88149","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Denis Wakefield","data":{"first_name":"Denis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022778","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wakefield","source_individual_id":"RMIS72560","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Denis Wakefield"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82868","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003008","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lloyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS117886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Lloyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77503","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Tracey Davenport","data":{"first_name":"Tracey","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0001179","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Davenport","source_individual_id":"RMIS119519","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Tracey Davenport"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76991","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2706","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Control of SNARE-mediated granule fusion in mast cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Munc18","SNARE fusion","Secretion","Syntaxin","Tethering and docking"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157045,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Allergy","Anaphylaxis","Asthma","Urticaria"],"scientific_title":"Control of SNARE-mediated granule fusion in mast cells","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Keith Stanley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157045","simplified_title":"Controlling the release of histamine from immune cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"Asthma is an allergic disease affecting two million Australians.

The parts of the hypothalamus that deal with cardiovascular and other autonomic functions are expected to be similar in the rat and human and the present study will identify in the human all major regions that have been identified in the rat.

The chemical mapping study then serves two roles: (a) It permits the identification of the chemical profile (signature) of an area and consequently enables its identification in the human, and (b) it reveals the chemicals the area utilizes for possible theoretical and practical considerations.

Dementia sometimes has a genetic basis and identification of such cases has improved our understanding of the events leading to the destruction of the brain tissue. In the vast majority of people, the degenerative changes were previously thought to be as a result of Alzheimer's disease. However, our recent research, funded by the NHMRC, confirms international findings showing more than 25% of people with dementia have a different disease called Dementia with Lewy bodies or DLB. Of course identifying these patients occurs at death when the cells in the brain can be examined for Lewy bodies. We now know that the brain degeneration differs significantly in patients with this disease. However, it is still not possible to identify DLB in life with any certainty. This project aims to develop objective methods to clinically differentiate dementia patients. We will seek out families in which genetic influences may underly the disease and determine whether these factors differ from those found in other dementing illnesses.

These receptors lie deep within the skull in the inner ear and disease of them can cause dizziness (vertigo) and unsteadiness. Due to their location, investigation of the function of these receptors has been difficult. With NH and MRC support, I have developed two new methods of vestibular assessment. These are now being applied both here and overseas. Perhaps the clearest example of how these new techniques have improved current diagnostic methods is the Tullio phenomenon, in which patients feel dizzy in response to loud sounds. My colleagues and I have shown that these patients always have a characteristic abnormality to click activation of the inner ear, one of the tests that I developed. It is likely to have a very important role in distiguishing between patients with Xray abnormalities predisposing to this condition and those who actually have the full-blown syndrome, so that the correct treatment is offered. This proposal seeks to build on the previous successful one. In it, I propose further new methods of investigating the vestibular apparatus, which avoid some of the preconditions necessary for the present tests and would allow more widespread application of them. Furthermore, additional specific disease states which are characterised by unsteadiness (ataxia) will be assessed with these new methods to determine whether abnormal vestibular reflexes are partly responsible for the loss of balance. In one of the conditions to be investigated, gentamicin-induced vestibular impairment, there is the possibility in the future of applying these techniques to detect changes early, at a time when they are potentially reversible."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Colebatch","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041702","middle_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Colebatch","source_individual_id":"RMIS527866","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Colebatch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87817","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2701","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of neuropathic pain","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["injury","nerve","pain"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157019,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["causalgia","chronic pain","neuropathic pain"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of neuropathic pain","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Tracey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157019","simplified_title":"Pain due to nerve injury","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196018.36","source_system":"Disorders of pain sensation due to nerve damage are common, debilitating and difficult to treat.

We have found that we can stimulate foam cells to secrete this protein by adding to them another molecule called apo A-I.

Interestingly, MTf has many similarities to the serum iron-binding protein, transferrin, and initially MTf was thought to play a role in iron uptake by these cells. However, a series of studies by the applicant demonstrated that MTf did not play a major role in iron uptake by melanoma cells (Richardson et al. 1990, 1991a,b). In fact, most iron taken up by these cells was via the binding of transferrin to the transferrin receptor. More recently, under the current NHMRC grant, we have been able to confirm and signficantly extend our previous studies to convincingly show that MTf is not involved in iron uptake by melanoma cells where it is expressed at very high levels (Richardson 2000 Eur. J. Biochem. 267 (in press). In addition, we showed that the expression of MTf in 50 human tissues was very different to transferrin and the transferrin receptor (TfR) that are well known to be involved in iron transport. For example, the TfR is expressed at high levels in tissues that require large amounts of iron eg. the placenta and bone marrow. In contrast, MTf was not expressed at high levels in these tissues, but was found in large amounts in unexpected locations such as the salivary gland. Furthermore, the expression of MTf was widespread through a variety of tissues, and in contrast to expectations, was found at higher levels in normal rather than fetal tissues. It is also intesting that MTf is found in the blood and brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Our results suggest that MTf may play other unexpected roles apart from iron uptake. The present proposal will assess the roles of MTf in cellular functioning. This information will be very important in understanding the function of MTf in cancer cells, Alzheimer's disease and also in other tissues (eg. the salivary gland) where it is expressed at very high levels."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Des Richardson","data":{"first_name":"Des","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021702","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Richardson","source_individual_id":"5011194","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Des Richardson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82581","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2598","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Ongoing Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"nhmrc_grant_id":151603,"application_year":2000,"start_year":2001,"scientific_title":"Ongoing Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"","cia_name":"Prof Wendy Jessup","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/151603","simplified_title":"Ongoing Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"205707.93","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wendy Jessup","data":{"first_name":"Wendy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031579","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jessup","source_individual_id":"RMIS97823","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wendy Jessup"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85174","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2597","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Lipoprotein oxidation, antioxidants & atherosclerosis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"nhmrc_grant_id":151602,"application_year":2000,"start_year":2001,"scientific_title":"Lipoprotein oxidation, antioxidants & atherosclerosis","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"","cia_name":"Prof Roland Stocker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/151602","simplified_title":"Lipoprotein oxidation, antioxidants & atherosclerosis","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"651716.79","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roland Stocker","data":{"first_name":"Roland","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022352","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stocker","source_individual_id":"RMIS152181","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Roland Stocker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82767","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2596","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Lipoprotein oxidation, antioxidants and atherosclerosis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Antioxidants","Atherosclerosis","Lipid peroxidation","Lipoproteins","Protein oxidation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":151600,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Antioxidant micronutrients","Atherosclerosis","Cardiovascular disease","Restenosis"],"scientific_title":"Lipoprotein oxidation, antioxidants and atherosclerosis","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Lipids","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Roland Stocker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/151600","simplified_title":"Does rancid fat really cause the hardening of blood vessels?","sub_type":"Standard Project with Research Fellowship","total_budget":"281812.54","source_system":"We are studying how major blood vessels harden. This process (called atherosclerosis) is the major underlying cause of heart disease, the major single cause of death of Australians. Our research focusses on the 'Oxidation Theory', one of the most common theories of how atherosclerosis develops. Accordingly, fats in fat-carrying particles (called lipoproteins) penetrate the walls of blood vessels, where they cause disease as a result of going rancid. This is a primary reason for the general public's interest in antioxidant supplements to combat heart disease. However, it is not clear at present whether rancid fats is a cause or consequence of atherosclerosis, and we recently showed that the two processes can be dissociated in an animal model of the disease. This application addresses the question of whether the process of fats going rancid can be generally dissociated from atherosclerosis, using several different animal models of the disease. We will distinguish different chemical pathways that give rise to different types of rancid fats, and between rancid fats and 'rancid' proteins. Such studies have not been carried out to date. Our underlying hypothesis is that the process of lipoprotein fat going rancid is a consequnece rather than a cause of atherosclerosis and heart disease. By testing this hypothesis, we will provide a rationale for whether antioxidant supplements aimed at preventing rancid fats from accumulating are likely of benefit in terms of preventing heart disease. This is of direct interest to public health. Our studies also address the issue of how antioxidants (if not through preventing fats from going rancid) attenuate atherosclerosis. We will focus on a particular synthetic antioxidant for which there is strong evidence that it is beneficial in preventing the re-narrowing of blood vessels in humans undergoing coronary angioplasty. These studies have the potential to provide new clues for the development of novel drugs against heart disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roland Stocker","data":{"first_name":"Roland","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022352","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stocker","source_individual_id":"RMIS152181","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Roland Stocker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82767","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2595","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Vasodilator mechanisms: anatomical and functional variability amongst different vascular beds, disease states & species","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["EDHF","endothelial dysfunction","gap junction","vascular anatomy","vasodilation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":148943,"application_year":2000,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Vasodilator mechanisms: anatomical and functional variability amongst different vascular beds, disease states & species","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Shaun Sandow","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/148943","simplified_title":"Vasodilator mechanisms: anatomical and functional variability amongst different vascular beds, disease states & species","sub_type":"Peter Doherty Biomedical ECF","total_budget":"229991.79","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Shaun Sandow","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033616","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Sandow","source_individual_id":"5017327","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Shaun Sandow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85707","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2560","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cellular immunity in hepatitis C exposed uninfected injecting drug users and transfused thalassaemic patients","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Cellular immunology","Exposed seronegative injecting drug users","Hepatitis C virus","Thalassaemia","Viral clearance"],"nhmrc_grant_id":145884,"application_year":2000,"start_year":2001,"scientific_title":"Cellular immunity in hepatitis C exposed uninfected injecting drug users and transfused thalassaemic patients","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Anthony Freeman","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/145884","simplified_title":"Cellular immunity in hepatitis C exposed uninfected injecting drug users and transfused thalassaemic patients","sub_type":"Medical Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"83987.9","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anthony Freeman","data":{"first_name":"Anthony","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042484","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Freeman","source_individual_id":"RMIS681582","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Anthony Freeman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88018","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2522","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Development, Assessment and Treatment of Early Indicators of Psychopathy in Children","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Behavioural family interventions","Child behaviour","Child development","Clinical child psychology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":145309,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Antisocial behaviour","Child psychopathy","Conduct disorder"],"scientific_title":"The Development, Assessment and Treatment of Early Indicators of Psychopathy in Children","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Mark Dadds","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/145309","simplified_title":"Early Signs of Psychopathy in Children","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"271130.45","source_system":"2.7 Significance - Lay description Conduct problems and antisocial behaviour cost Australian society millions of dollars every year directly through the mental health and criminal justice systems, indirectly through their association with substance abuse and other mental health problems, and associated disruptions to health, relationships, and personal and occupational functioning. Remediation is not effective once a chronic pattern has been established. Recently, research has shown that early signs of psychopathy in children predict chronic antisocial behaviour and lack of responsiveness to traditional treatments. The current research uses a combination of experimental, longitudinal, and treatment outcome studies to examine: the effectiveness with which early signs of a callous-unemotional temperamental style, hypothesised to be an early indicator of psychopathy, can be measured in children, causal factors and correlates of callous-unemotional traits, whether such traits pose a risk for chronic antisocial behaviour, the effects of callous-unemotional traits on responsiveness to traditional family-school based treatments, and the effectiveness of an innovative method for treating it in the early years. The project leads directly to a range of clinical assessment and treatment strategies for children at risk for chronic antisocial behaviour. The project has the potential to substantially improve the effectiveness of current treatment approaches to conduct problems in children that focus on family and school management."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Dadds","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012594","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Dadds","source_individual_id":"RMIS96625","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Dadds"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80114","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2434","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Impact of the refugee application process on the psychiatric status of traumatized asylum seekers: a prospective study","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Human rights abuses and mental health","Mental health of asylum seekers","Physical health of asylum seekers","Refugee mental health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":136000,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Adaptation of asylum seekers","Posttraumatic stress disorder","Refugee Application Process"],"scientific_title":"Impact of the refugee application process on the psychiatric status of traumatized asylum seekers: a prospective study","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Derrick Silove","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/136000","simplified_title":"The psychiatric status of asylum seekers following the refugee application process","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"147859.82","source_system":"Although the numbers of persons who identify themselves as fleeing from persecution (asylum seekers) residing in Western countries has increased substantially in the last decade, very little research has been undertaken on the psychiatric and physical health of this group. The only studies published in professional journals have been produced by members of the applicant team. The results indicate that approximately 50% have suffered gross human rights violations including torture, detention in concentration camps and brainwashing, and 37% are affected by ongoing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - terrifying memories of past abuses, avoidance of experiences that trigger such memories, social withdrawal, and constant anxiety. The research has also shown that psychiatric symptoms may be worsened by the fears and insecurities associated with the asylum seeking process, but the exact impact of stresses such as rejection of their primary application at 2-3 months, could not be determined. We therefore aim to conduct the first study of its kind that traces the impact of such stresses on the mental health of asylum seekers. In addition, we will track asylum seekers' general health problems and the difficulties they may experience in accessing basic medical health services. This evidence will provide scientific confirmation of how stress can worsen PTSD; indicate that some asylum seekers may be in special need of support throughout the asylum assessment process; assist policy makers to re-assess the methods and processs of assessing asylum claims; and provide impetus to establishing better services for the medical and psychiatric problems faced by asylum seekers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Derrick Silove","data":{"first_name":"Derrick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010266","middle_name":"","last_name":"Silove","source_individual_id":"5017515","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Derrick Silove"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79488","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2148","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Intracellular cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides and hydroxides- their metabolism and their modulation of cell function","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["atherosclerosis","lipoprotein","lysosome","macrophages","oxidation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":119250,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","coronary heart disease","stroke"],"scientific_title":"Intracellular cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides and hydroxides- their metabolism and their modulation of cell function","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

A key component in the formation of atherosclerotic narrowings is the accumulation of fat-filled cells called foam cell macrophages in artery walls. Our study investigates the nature of the fats that macrophages accumulate, and how mild modification of these fats changes the metabolism of the macrophage. Cholesterol circulates in the blood stream as specialised particles called lipoproteins. The lipoprotein containing most of the cholesterol is low density lipoprotein (LDL), so-called bad cholesterol. LDL is the main source of fat that accumulates in the artery wall in atherosclerosis. When in the artery wall, it is taken up by macrophages which develop a foamy appearance. The accumulation of LDL fats within macrophages is greatly enhanced by the prior modification of LDL. The most well known of these modifications is oxidation- a chemical process of fat spoilage as occurs with rancid butter. Mild oxidation of LDL is well known to occur in human atherosclerosis. However, the ability of macrophages to accumulate the products of mild oxidation has never been established. We have recently discovered that the lipid products of mild oxidation of LDL can build up in macrophages. We achieved this by developing a new system of feeding oxidised LDL to macrophages. Surprisingly, not only could these lipid oxidation products be internalised by the cells, but they progressively accumulated over time, and caused major disturbances in the ability of macrophages to clear ordinary fats inside the cell. This means that mild oxidation of LDL can cause secondary damage inside the macrophage, which is far greater than had previously been realised. This project investigates precisely how the oxidised LDL is metabolised by macrophages and how it disturbs other cell functions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leonard Kritharides","data":{"first_name":"Leonard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008461","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kritharides","source_individual_id":"RMIS1108085","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leonard Kritharides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78986","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2062","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"REGULATION AND NOVEL FUNCTIONS OF INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase","Inflammation","Macrophage","Raman resonance spectroscopy","Redox regulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":119230,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Atherosclerosis","Infection","Inflammation","Neurological disorders"],"scientific_title":"REGULATION AND NOVEL FUNCTIONS OF INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Roland Stocker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/119230","simplified_title":"REGULATION OF TRYPTOPHAN METABOLISM","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"268403.51","source_system":"We are studying a protein important in the host's response to infections.

In many patients, this attack is mild and resolves with current treatments to dampen the immune response. In others, current treatment is inadequate to dampen the attack and the kidney is destroyed. This research uses experimental models of nephritis to examine how the immune system injures the glomeruli. In particular, how T cells attack and mediate injury. This is a novel concept, as hither to it has been thought antibodies and other factors in the blood (complement) mediate injury. Our group was one of the first to identify T cells mediate injury in forms of glomerulonephritis, previously thought to be solely mediated by antibody and complement. This project will further define which molecules produced by the T cell effect injury of glomeruli. With the potential aim of turning off the T cell attack mechanisms in a more specific way than is achieved by non specific immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids, cytotoxic (anti-cancer) drugs or cyclosporine (an anti-rejection drug).

This proposal aims to study the impact a dysfunctional endothelial lining, in particular a reduction in nitric oxide synthesis, has on development and control of the cardiovascular system.

This study will investigate the impact reduced nitric oxide synthesis in the fetal period has on adult blood pressure. This study will investigate the mechanisms-factors which contribute to altered control and-or structure of heart and blood vessels in the fetus, newborn and adult after inhibition of the nitric oxide synthesis.

Preventative surgery is now known to significantly reduce risk in women with a strong family history of breast cancer. Whether these potential benefits are realised in practice needs to be evaluated, as do potential psychological harms, if any. Predictive genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer has become technically possible before its impact on psychological outcomes has been evaluated. As yet there are no Australian data on the impact of predisposition testing in any potentially treatable adult onset conditions and only preliminary overseas data. Results from this study may therefore have application to other potentially treatable adult onset conditions. Changes before and after testing in psychological status will be studied (using established methodology) over a 2-year period to identify when negative outcomes are most likely to occur. In addition, this study aims to identify factors that facilitate or hinder psychological adjustment so as to inform clinical decisions about testing and to allow appropriate interventions to be devised. Assessment of individual's preferences for the amount of information they receive will allow tailoring of information to maximise the benefit of educational materials and potentially minimise distress.

The autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, gastrointestinal function, immune responses and certain forms of pain. Negative emotions can have a strong impact on autonomic function. We have all experienced the sweaty hands, pounding heart and intestinal discomfort when the mail arrives and bad news is expected or when we face a deadline for which we are not prepared. This is known as psychological stress and it is usually associated with anxiety. Unfortunately, it is also the most common form of stress in modern urban life. There are clear indications that when these autonomic changes become chronic they can lead to hypertension, weak immune responses and gastric ulcers. In people already suffering from cardiovascular diseases they can also precipitate cardiac and cerebrovascular accidents. Clearly, the link between psychological stress and the autonomic nervous system needs to be explored in more detail. This project looks at the organization of the neural network in the brain and spinal cord that controls these responses. It uses a simple model of psychological stress in the conscious rat and recent non invasive techniques to record blood pressure and look at neuronal activity. We think that we have identified a group of neurons that may be controlling very specifically this response. It is located in the hypothalamus. The aim of this project is to further test the role of these neurons and find out what is controlling them. They will also be compared to another group of neurons that also controls blood pressure but apparently not in relation to psychological stress. The possibility that the cardiovascular response to psychological stress might be mediated by a specific group of neurons in the brain is a very exciting finding.

Much of this sensing process takes place through our special sense systems such as the eye, the ear, and the taste and olfactory systems. However, other crucial sensory systems are more generalized throughout the body and are referred to as the somatic sensory systems. These include our senses of touch, temperature, pain and body position, the last of which is known as our kinaesthetic sense. Our research into the neural mechanisms in sensation and perception is concerned with the tactile, kinaesthetic and pain senses. Although many thousands of nerve fibres travel in the nerves arising from particular regions of the skin or from individual muscles or joints, the sensory nerve fibres that serve these forms of sensation fall into fewer than ten broad classes, made up of five major tactile classes, two or three major kinaesthetic classes, and two broad groups of fibres that mediate pain sensation. However, there is quite striking evidence that when single fibres of these different classes are activated in conscious human subjects, there are marked differences among the fibre classes in their capacity to generate a perceptual response. Under the new NH and MRC grant we propose to examine the transmission and processing of input signals from these fibre classes at the highest levels of the brain, in particular, within the cerebral cortex, in order to reveal the neural mechanisms responsible for their differential perceptual contributions. The proposed analysis will provide fundamental insights into the neural basis for perceptual recognition and will provide information that may be important for our eventual understanding of the disorders of sensory perception that characterize psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Mark Rowe","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039426","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Rowe","source_individual_id":"RMIS67211","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Mark Rowe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87224","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1967","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Factors controlling leucocyte migration in healthy intestine and in inflammatory bowel disease","data":{"media_summary":"Ulcerative colitis","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Chemokine receptor","Inflammatory bowel disease","Leucocyte recruitment","Mucosal immunity","Neuropeptide"],"nhmrc_grant_id":113853,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Crohn's disease","Inflammatory bowel disease","Intestinal mucosa","Mucosal immunity","Ulcerative colitis"],"scientific_title":"Factors controlling leucocyte migration in healthy intestine and in inflammatory bowel disease","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Grimm","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/113853","simplified_title":"Leucocyte migration in IBD","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"195217.18","source_system":"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are relapsing and remitting disorders of the intestine that create substantial disability in a relatively young population of patients. Our treatments for these conditions have changed little in the last 30 years and they are commonly accompanied by side effects. Research into the mechanisms controlling the gut inflammation offers promise for the development of novel, targeted and less toxic therapies. The major mediators of damage in IBD are white blood cells recruited from the circulation to affected intestine. This recruitment is induced by the production in damaged intestine of chemokines, proteins of the immune system that attract and activate white blood cells. Chemokines act through chemokine receptors on the surface of white blood cells, and earlier research by our group has demonstrated that these chemokine receptors can be functionally modulated by neuropeptides, proteins unrelated to chemokines that normally transmit messages within the nervous system. This project aims to explore the chemokines and chemokine receptors responsible for the recruitment of white blood cells to normal and IBD-affected intestine, in order to determine therapeutic targets for novel treatments. Moreover, the role of neuropeptides in modulating the recruitment of white blood cells to the intestine will be examined in cells from the human intestine, both normal and IBD-affected, as well as in an animal model of IBD. This project will provide an understanding of the signals responsible for the attraction of damaging white blood cells to sites of inflammation in the bowel and will indicate mechanisms used by the immune system to regulate those signals. It has the potential to direct us to new therapies that use highly targeted and physiologically appropriate approaches to controlling white blood cell trafficking in health and disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Grimm","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025198","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Grimm","source_individual_id":"RMIS132630","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Grimm"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83483","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1966","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Synthetic Analogues of the Actinomycin, Quinamycin and Nogalamycin Groups of Antitumour Antibiotics","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["3-Dimensional Structure of DNA-Drug Complexes","Anticancer Drug Development","Apoptosis and Differentiation","Cytoxicity and Antitumour Activity","DNA Intercalating Inhibitors of Transcription"],"nhmrc_grant_id":113847,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Drug Resistant Tumours","Solid and Disseminated Tumours"],"scientific_title":"Synthetic Analogues of the Actinomycin, Quinamycin and Nogalamycin Groups of Antitumour Antibiotics","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Laurence Wakelin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/113847","simplified_title":"Synthetic Analogues of Antitumour Antibiotics","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"376433.25","source_system":"The principal difficulty in the treatment of the common solid tumours that cause the majority of cancer deaths is the problem of drug resistance. For example, many patients with cancer of the lung, breast or colon respond well to drug treatment with their tumours initially regressing, only to return later in an aggressive drug-resistant form. In this event, the inevitable outcome is that the tumour grows through drug treatment and the patient eventually succumbs and dies. This is also a familiar scenario in the treatment of adults with leakaemias and non-Hodgkins lymphomas. The underlying cause of drug resistance is the genetic instability of cancer cells which results in tumours that are heterogeneous, making it almost inevitable that a cancer cell will arise that is resistant to treatment. There are many mechanisms of resistance, some of which are peculiar to particular drug types, some are permeability barriers and some involve genetic deregulation of the biochemistry of cell death. One way of subverting resistance is by the use of drugs whose mechanism of action is novel so that the tumour is challenged to devise a new defense. Here, we are attempting to develop synthetic analogues of a class of naturally- occurring antitumour antibiotic whose mechanism of action is unusual but which has not been exploited by medicinal chemists because of the difficulty of the chemistry involved. These antibiotics work by binding to DNA and inhibiting the first step in the process whereby genes are turned into proteins. We have designed compounds that are chemically accessible that our preliminary work suggests mimic the DNA-binding and biological properties of the natural antibiotics. The proposed work will enable us to evaluate whether this new class of agent has experimental antitumour activity, particularly amongst drug-resistant tumours."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Laurence Wakelin","data":{"first_name":"Laurence","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0022779","middle_name":"Patrick George","last_name":"Wakelin","source_individual_id":"RMIS5974866","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Laurence Wakelin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82869","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1965","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF BEHAVIOUR AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES","data":{"media_summary":"genetics","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Intellectual Disability","autism","epidemiological cohort","genetic syndromes","psychopathology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":113844,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Intellectual Disability","Mental Health","autism","epidemiology","genetics"],"scientific_title":"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF BEHAVIOUR AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Stewart Einfeld","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/113844","simplified_title":"BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"761790.36","source_system":"Families caring for young people with intellectual disabilities face major burdens of care if the young person also has serious behaviour problems.

We propose to examine these cells in patients with asthma, those experiencing allergic reactions to drugs and other allergies and determine their characteristics and their growth responses to a number of growth factors which have been demonstrated to affect the growth of cells known as mast cells in the test tube. Once we have characterised these cells in terms of what particular proteins and other products they contain we will then try to correlate the number and type of cell with the clinical allergic state of the patient. Blood will be obtained from patients undergoing acute asthma and those in remission to determine if there is any specific relationship of these cells with acute allergic reactions. We will be also looking at how these cells regulate other physiological systems in the body, in particular possible explanations why patients that suffer acute allergic reactions develop significant drops in blood pressure. We can identify these cells with a specific antibody that we have used in our preliminary studies. This antibody binds the surface of these cells, however the specific protein to which this antibody binds has not been identified.

The vinca alkaloids are an important class of natural product drugs which disrupt microtubules and are particularly effective in the treatment of adult and childhood cancers. Unfortunately, some cancer cells fail to respond to this treatment due to the development of drug resistance. This proposal addresses vinca alkaloid resistance in children?s cancer and will determine why certain cancer cells fail treatment. Furthermore, this study will identify the role of certain components of microtubules that appear to be related to drug resistance in leukaemia and neuroblastoma cells and whose role is unknown.

Emerging research by our group and others suggest that some types of severe depression in later life are due to undetected forms of cerebrovascular disease. If we are able to demonstrate that the key features of severe depression of this type (psychomotor, attentional, memory and executive disturbance and global disability) are related to such brain changes this may lead to a major breakthrough in the prevention and treatment of these disorders. A new type of brain imaging technology called 'functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging' (fMRI) permits simultaneous investigation of the structure and function of small areas of the brain. As the technique does not use radiation and can be performed while the patient is completing mental tasks, it can be used in repeated experiments. Consequently, it permits description of brain changes (areas of activation) that occur during specific mental tasks.

However, these treatments are also toxic to normal cells so very high doses that might be more effective to kill the leukaemic cells can not be given. At the doses which can be administered, the leukaemia often (in greater than 50% of patients) becomes resistant. The present project seeks to use a novel treatment strategy in which genes are used to modify the genetic abnormalities present in these leukaemic cells thereby stopping their growth. This growth suppression will be specific to the leukaemic cells as it targets their abnormal genetics leaving normal cells alone. The gene therapeutics have already been identified in part and the aims of this grant are: 1. To show that the gene therapeutic approach is justified to selectively stop the leukaemic cells from growing. 2. To confirm novel means to identify the inhibitory genes. 3. To determine the best inhibitory gene(s). 4. To show how these inhibitory genes can be delivered to the patients' cells and to model their effect in animal models.

Considerable health funding is allocated to joint replacement for the nation, although successful, outcomes are finite. Importantly, and aside from costs, patients morbidity is high. The major cause of long-term failure of these prosthetic replacements is aseptic loosening, the result of bone loss at the bone-device interface. Novel approaches to development of more efficient implant materials would ultimately lead to major contributions to the mobility and and quality of life for these patients. Considerable effort has been devoted to alter surface characteristics of orthopaedic implants to improve the interlocking of device and skeleton. We were the first to demonstrate that surface chemical modification of biomaterials using selected ions resulted in an enhanced bone formation. This proposal is aimed at chemically modifying the surfaces of commonly used orthopaedic and dental materials, to improve the biocompatibility of new devices and the surface coatings for existing prostheses. Furthermore, this application will build on the in vitro data showing that particular peptides specifically bind osteoblasts and therefore have the potential to provide a surface on a prosthesis that is conducive to bone formation. To date, we have coupled these peptides to metallic surfaces and will proceed to study the osteoblastic phenotype and subsequent osteogenesis.

Service planning to reduce this burden requires knowledge of cost-effective treatments.This project will trial a method used for combining burden and cost-effectiveness data to design an essential package of services to address the treatment shortfall in mental disorders. This research will assist in our understanding of why burden due to mental disorders persists, and the extent to which current treatment knowledge is able to address this burden within existing budgetary constraints. This will be achieved by: 1) detailing the costs and population outcome of current services in Australia for mental disorders, to determine which disorders are currently adequately treated and which disorders require further intervention, 2) calculating the costs and outcome of best practice interventions from clinical practice guidelines, to understand the extent to which current treatment knowledge can reduce burden due to mental disorders, 3) examining the equity consequences of such a package of ideal interventions, with the understanding that the treatment endpoint is not the same for all disorders. This is a secondary analysis, representing a method for translating existing cost and outcome data for individual treatments into their costs and consequences for health planning at the population level."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gavin Andrews","data":{"first_name":"Gavin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005813","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Andrews","source_individual_id":"5013220","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gavin Andrews"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78288","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1956","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"What contributes to regional vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases?

These neurodegenerative diseases are usually relentlessly progressive and with time render patients incapable of many normal functions. For some families with certain genetic defects, these diseases occur aggressively and early. We would like to study the brains of patients from these families because in most cases the proteins affected by the gene defect have been identified. However, despite knowing this important information, the reasons for the death of brain cells are still not understood. This project will provide important new information on which brain cells died in these patients and on the relationship between such cell death and any cellular protein changes. By comparing patients with different genetic defects we will be able to identify the main cellular mechanisms underlying these degenerative changes. This information is essential for the rational design of further experiments aimed at reducing the suffering of all patients with neurodegenerative diseases or at eliminating these diseases altogether."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glenda Halliday","data":{"first_name":"Glenda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019412","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Halliday","source_individual_id":"RMIS4337831","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Glenda Halliday"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81939","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1955","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Changes in pelvic autonomic neurons after spinal nerve injury","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Autonomic nervous system ? anatomy","Autonomic reflexes ? urogenital tract","Neural plasticity and sprouting"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102447,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Bladder dysfunction","Impotence","Spinal injury"],"scientific_title":"Changes in pelvic autonomic neurons after spinal nerve injury","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autonomic Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Janet Keast","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102447","simplified_title":"Effects of spinal injury on nerve cells that control bladder and reproductive function","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"176734.52","source_system":"This project is about the effects of spinal injury on autonomic neurons that control the bladder, lower bowel and reproductive organs. One of the consequences of some types of spinal injury is that there are no signals being sent from the spinal cord to the nerve cells outside the cord, and this leads to poor bladder control, impotence, etc. We are mimicking this problem experimentally by damaging the spinal nerves that carry these signals. We have found that after this type of damage the pelvic autonomic neurons make many new connections between each other, and the types of new connections depend on which spinal nerves have been injured. This leads to the question: are these new connections good or bad? ie are they helpful in trying to get organ control back to normal or will they stop the correct connections from the spinal cord from being made in the future? This project addresses these questions by using sophisticated techniques for staining and visualising individual nerve fibres growing out from the spinal cord. We will track how well these fibres grow back and connect with the pelvic autonomic neurons. In particular, we will see whether they make correct connections, and if these connections are influenced by the new fibres that have grown between the autonomic neurons in the interim period. We will also do physiological tests to see if the new connections have the correct function. The ultimate aim of these studies is not only to understand more about regeneration, but to see what determines whether the correct connections have been made - and ideally, to give us insight into how we can make regeneration work more quickly and accurately. We believe that this work is an important adjunct to other studies on spinal injury, which mostly focuses on regaining voluntary motor control (e.g. walking); however loss of bladder, bowel and reproductive function is another important quality of life issue for spinal injury patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Janet
