The results of this study may lead to new therapeutic approaches to control malignant melanoma and other metastatic cancers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shaun Mccoll","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020717","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Mccoll","source_individual_id":"RMIS15917","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Shaun Mccoll"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82300","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Iain Comerford","data":{"first_name":"Iain","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006678","middle_name":"","last_name":"Comerford","source_individual_id":"5038602","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Iain Comerford"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78512","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Brown","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000583","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS10107","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76815","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/73056","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Testosterone intervention for the prevention of diabetes mellitus in high risk men: a randomised trial","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2016,"keywords":["testosterone","diabetes prevention","cardiovascular","inflammatory cytokines","clinical trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1030123,"application_year":2011,"start_year":2012,"scientific_title":"Testosterone intervention for the prevention of diabetes mellitus in high risk men: a randomised trial","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Gary Wittert","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1030123","simplified_title":"Testosterone for the prevention of diabetes mellitus in high risk men: a randomised trial","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"5016747.47","source_system":"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasingly common, costly and deadly.

Future health benefits may be tests to help improve stroke outcome in patients and therapy to decrease loss of brain cells after stroke."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Koblar","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043554","middle_name":"Andrea","last_name":"Koblar","source_individual_id":"5015762","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Simon Koblar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88295","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Yingxi Lin","data":{"first_name":"Yingxi","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014489","middle_name":"Xi","last_name":"Lin","source_individual_id":"5023630","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Yingxi Lin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80618","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Martin Lewis","data":{"first_name":"Martin","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014452","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Lewis","source_individual_id":"5020296","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Martin Lewis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80610","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/66127","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Peptidase inhibitor 16: a new biomarker for human Treg","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["molecular immunology","biological markers","mechanism of action"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1003185,"application_year":2010,"health_keywords":["autoimmune disease","cellular interactions","novel therapeutic agents"],"scientific_title":"Peptidase inhibitor 16: a new biomarker for human Treg","start_year":2011,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Applied Immunology (incl.

If successful at reducing egg allergy, this approach will have a significant impact on reducing the burden of allergic disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Susan Prescott","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044912","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Prescott","source_individual_id":"5012270","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Susan Prescott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88624","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Debra Palmer","data":{"first_name":"Debra","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044683","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Palmer","source_individual_id":"5016866","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Debra Palmer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88555","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Maria Makrides","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032291","middle_name":"","last_name":"Makrides","source_individual_id":"5011980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Maria Makrides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Gold","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019247","middle_name":"Steven","last_name":"Gold","source_individual_id":"5014876","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Gold"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81908","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65240","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomised controlled trial of iodine supplementation in pregnancy to enhance neurodevelopment in children","data":{"media_summary":"public health impact","end_year":2014,"keywords":["child development","iodine nutrition","maternal nutrition","public health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":626800,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["child development","iodine deficiency","nutrition in pregnancy","pregnancy care","public health impact"],"scientific_title":"A randomised controlled trial of iodine supplementation in pregnancy to enhance neurodevelopment in children","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Nutrition Intervention","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"NUTRITION AND DIETICS","cia_name":"Prof Maria Makrides","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/626800","simplified_title":"Pregnancy Iodine and Neurodevelopment in Kids (PINK) Trial","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"2032008.41","source_system":"The mild iodine deficiency common among people living in South Eastern Australia is of sufficient concern for the government to order that all bread be fortified with low dose iodine.

However, data from Australia are lacking. In addition no study has been conducted so far that assessed and compared the cost-efficacy of a herbal preparations and a chemically defined treatment. Thus this project aims to assess and compare the effects of a standardised herbal preparation (STW-9) and-or a proton pump inhibitor on the relief of symptoms and the cost-efficacy in patients suffering from functional dyspepsia. In addition, we will assess whether there is an association between the clinical response (complete or substantial improvement of symptoms) and the symptom pattern, the changes of the sensitivity of the stomach (as assessed with a standardised nutrient challenge) and we will elucidate the role of specific receptor channels called Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels that are involved in the manifestation of abdominal sysmptoms such as pain or discomfort. This study will establish the cost-efficacy of a standardised herbal preparation (as compared to the stablshed treatment standard), allows to identify subgroups of patients who will most likely respond to therapy and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms. Thus, this study bears the potential to substantially improve the quality of care and cost efficacy of treatment of patients with this highly prevalent disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Holloway","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043099","middle_name":"Holmes","last_name":"Holloway","source_individual_id":"RMIS13461","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Holloway"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88168","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christian Gericke","data":{"first_name":"Christian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030864","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Gericke","source_individual_id":"5014808","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christian Gericke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85001","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Birgit Adam","data":{"first_name":"Birgit","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017363","middle_name":"","last_name":"Adam","source_individual_id":"5013125","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Birgit Adam"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81423","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Fraser","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013095","middle_name":"John Lovat","last_name":"Fraser","source_individual_id":"RMIS6048","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Fraser"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80240","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gerald Holtmann","data":{"first_name":"Gerald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007948","middle_name":"","last_name":"Holtmann","source_individual_id":"5015307","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gerald Holtmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78850","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicholas Talley","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004934","middle_name":"","last_name":"Talley","source_individual_id":"RMIS8355","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicholas Talley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78035","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62703","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Life-threatening ulcer complications in the elderly: Role of visceral sensory function and molecular mechanisms","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Cytokines","Mucosal inflammation","Visceral afferents"],"nhmrc_grant_id":508110,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Disease prevention","Elderly","Peptic ulcer disease"],"scientific_title":"Life-threatening ulcer complications in the elderly: Role of visceral sensory function and molecular mechanisms","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology and Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Gerald Holtmann","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/508110","simplified_title":"Complications of peptic ulcer disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"445011.35","source_system":"A large proportion of patients with chronic disease such as peptic ulcer disease present with life-threatening complications such as severe peptic ulcer bleedings without any relevant symptoms prior to the manifestation of the complication.

This project will help identify new candidates for anti-diabetes drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Leonie Heilbronn","data":{"first_name":"Leonie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042986","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Heilbronn","source_individual_id":"RMIS2634454","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Leonie Heilbronn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88139","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62353","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Equipment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":520946,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2008,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Ms Vada Osborn","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/520946","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"455803","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Vada  Osborn","data":{"first_name":"Vada ","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0009479","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Osborn","source_individual_id":"RMIS973288","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Vada  Osborn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79276","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62188","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of improved preventative therapeutic strategies for the control of infectious disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2013,"keywords":["Bacterial pathogenicity","Bacterial virulence factors","Infectious diseases","invasive pneumococcal disease","shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":465465,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Development of improved preventative therapeutic strategies for the control of infectious disease","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof James Paton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/465465","simplified_title":"Development of improved preventative therapeutic strategies for the control of infectious disease","sub_type":"Australia Fellowship","total_budget":"4000000","source_system":"A major objective of this Australia Fellowship application is to provide a mechanism whereby, for the first time in my career, I can devote myself full-time to my program of research. This program addresses an issue of global significance, namely the control of bacterial infectious diseases. These continue to cause massive global morbidity and mortality and constitute a profound threat to human health, in spite of the availability of antimicrobial drugs for over 60 years. WHO estimates that bacterial infections are responsible for >10 million deaths p.a., and the economic impact is inestimable. For most major pathogens, vaccines are either unavailable or have serious shortcomings. Resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is increasing at an alarming rate, and modern travel has assisted the rapid global dissemination of highly resistant and virulent clones. Morbidity and mortality are also predicted to increase as a consequence of human-induced environmental changes and the growing proportion of the population with increased susceptibility to infection. Effective management of bacterial infectious diseases in the 21st century will require a two-pronged approach involving the development of cheaper and more effective vaccines, as well as novel anti-infectives refractory to known resistance mechanisms. However, formulation of optimal therapeutic and preventative strategies demands a thorough understanding of the biology of disease, particularly the complex interactions between bacterial pathogens and their human hosts. I have also played a leadership role in establishing the Pneumococcal Vaccine Consortium, which has just submitted a co-ordinated suite of multicentre proposals to PATH Vaccine Solutions to fund final preclinical testing, GMP scale-up and Phase I-II-III trials of protein-based pneumococcal vaccines that we have developed. The PATH accelerated pneumococcal vaccine development program is of enormous potential significance, because there is now a very real probability of pneumococcal protein vaccines being fast-tracked into human trials. Our aim is to create a direct pipeline from antigen discovery in the collaborators� laboratories into the clinic. If successful, these vaccines could save millions of lives. This will be of enormous satisfaction to me personally, as it was I who originally proposed and demonstrated �proof of principle� for the vaccine potential of pneumococcal proteins, and I have been advocating assessment of their protective efficacy in humans for over 20 years. Thus, receipt of an Australia Fellowship will undoubtedly further support the internationalisation of Australian medical research."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Paton","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027246","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Paton","source_individual_id":"RMIS7494","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Paton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84042","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62097","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Intergeneration Growth and Risk of Metaboloc Disorders","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["Diabetes","Epidemiology","Intergenerational health","Metabolic Disorders","women's and children's health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":465455,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2008,"scientific_title":"Intergeneration Growth and Risk of Metaboloc Disorders","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Davies","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/465455","simplified_title":"Intergeneration Growth and Risk of Metaboloc Disorders","sub_type":"A Healthy Start to Life (for All Australians)","total_budget":"2095468.97","source_system":"A compelling raft of studies has now shown that low birth weight predisposes to later, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and high cholesterol.

This has resulted in a new paradigm for understanding the transmission of disease risk from one generation to the next. A team of researchers based at the University of Adelaide led by Dr Davies has gained international recognition for being at the forefront of this research. Thirty years ago, the group established the Lucina cohort to study intergenerational health among women, and how conditions in pregnancy can affect the reproductive health of offspring in successive generations. Dr Davies and his team of researchers will expand this study in ways that were designed at the outset, but not commenced until now. This includes enrolling the traced mothers to study how their clinical experiences in pregnancy predict their own later risk of diabetes. We will also be seeking to enrol the siblings of the daughters so that we can identify events in pregnancies that predict which sibling is at increased risk of diabetes. Finally, the study will enrol the grandchildren and trace their birth records so that we can study the relationship between diabetes risk, intergenerational growth and how that risk can be substantially influenced by factors as basic as pre-pregnancy body weight and weight gain in pregnancy.

Rates of childhood obesity in Australia are at one of the highest amongst developed nations. 25% of Australian children are currently overweight or obese. Obesity is a strong risk factor for chronic disease. In children, obesity is of concern because it is highly likely to persist and, during childhood, contributes to serious physical and mental health problems. A quarter of Australian children are now carrying excess body fat. Because of these factors, prevention of obesity is paramount because success of current treatment options is limited and does not last. Especially harmful forms of fatness may originate in early life - the tendency to store fat in the abdominal region and the tendency to accrete fat rather than muscle (at any body size). For this reason, the early life determinants of obesity deserve special attention, even in the presence of society-wide factors conducive to obesity. Professor Moore and a group of researchers from the University of Adelaide will test the proposition that pre-birth and infancy is a �critical period� for the development of obesity. The group aims to investigate whether there is a distinct period in early life for acquiring the predisposition to harmful forms of fatness. The project also aims to identify practical opportunities for prevention, focusing on mothers and their infants."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Tony

In particular, increased risk of adult-onset diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease occurs when small and lean infants at birth are raised in conditions where nutrient intake is not restricted and obesity occurs. This concept of fetal programming is now widely accepted. Our laboratory is leading research in a new concept, that of embryonic programming. We have extensive animal data demonstrating that exposure of embryos to physiological perturbations alters fetal development, similarly to that occurring in nutrient restriction during pregnancy. Furthermore, there is data from IVF-derived children that their birth-weight is lower than expected, possibly due to the conditions used for conception in the laboratory. How does the response by eggs and embryos, at the time of conception, affect subsequent development? There has been some focus on changes to DNA that are not related to mutations, but structural changes in the DNA that alters gene expression. We call this epigenetics and epigenetic changes are found in embryos, including human embryos following IVF. However, no one knows how such epigenetic changes occur as a result of this stress response by the egg or embryo. Our proposal is to determine the mechanism of how epigenetic alterations take place in eggs and embryos. Our theory is that the mitochondria, the energy producing packages within all cells, are sending signals to the embryo's nucleus. When the egg or embryo finds itself in adverse conditions, the signals change as a result of changes in the energy balance. This in turn changes the activity of enzymes in the nucleus that regulates DNA structure. If we can prove that this relationship occurs, then we can assess these changes in human embryos that are excess to a patient's requirements and learn if programming takes place in human embryos."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Megan Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Megan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038582","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"5016516","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Megan Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86998","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stefan Hiendleder","data":{"first_name":"Stefan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037261","middle_name":"Gustav","last_name":"Hiendleder","source_individual_id":"RMIS4292197","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stefan Hiendleder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86655","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michelle Lane","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026134","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lane","source_individual_id":"RMIS2282530","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michelle Lane"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83760","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62087","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identifying the pathological mechanism of polyalanine expansion mutations in the X-linked Hypopituitarism gene SOX3","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["brain development","developmental genetics","gene targeting","pituitary gland","transcription factor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":465401,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Growth hormone deficiency","Mental retardation","Neurodevelopmental disorders","Neuroendocrine differentiation"],"scientific_title":"Identifying the pathological mechanism of polyalanine expansion mutations in the X-linked Hypopituitarism gene SOX3","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

In many cases, MR results from changes (mutations) in genes which regulate the development of the brain before birth. We are studying families with an inherited form of MR termed X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH) in which only boys are affected. In addition to intellectual disability, boys with XH also have poor pituitary function resulting in short stature and slow metabolism. In severe cases, where the pituitary has failed to form completely, these babies are extremely ill and in some instances do not survive. We have previously shown that XH is due to an unusual change in the SOX3 gene in which the number of consecutive alanine residues is increased above a critical threshold (polyalanine expansion mutations). Similar mutations have recently been identified in several other genes that also cause severe birth defects. However, little is currently known about how polyalanine expansion mutations cause these disorders. The overall aim of this proposal is generate a mouse model for this disorder. Analysis of these mice will help us to answer many unresolved questions about this disorder including: How does the mutant protein cause this disorder? Which parts of the brain and pituitary are affected and how is their function altered? How does the mutant protein affect other genes and proteins in the cell? Ultimately, we hope that this mouse model will help us to develop new and improved therapies for XH and other disorders that are caused by alanine expansion mutations."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul

When these chemicals bind the DR, it becomes an active gene regulatory protein, turning on genes that are involved in breakdown and excretion of the xenobiotics. Recently it has been found that the DR performs other important functions which are unrelated to xenobiotic breakdown. These include blood vessel development in the embryonic liver and hormone production during the estrous cycle. These observations imply that natural physiological mechanisms also exist for activating the DR, providing it with a separate code to perform these innate functions. A number of man-made chemicals, such as dioxins and PCBs, are especially good at activating the DR. However, they have chlorinated chemical structures, which are not broken down by the protective system. This creates a wide range of severe toxic responses. It has been established that toxicities result from persistent hyperactivation of the DR, but how this hyperactivation induces the toxic outcomes is not known. As the DR has roles in early development and estrogen production, this project will investigate how the DR becomes activated to perform these functions. Our initial experiments have shown that the DR can be activated by normal cell signalling systems, which induce distinct modifications (a distinct code) to the protein. We are comparing this code of modifications to those induced by xenobiotics which are able to be broken down, and dioxins which are resistant to breakdown. We hypothesise that dioxins will give an excessive code of activating modifications, resulting in uncontrolled regulation of genes used in both the developmental and xenobiotic breakdown pathways. We will explore the hypothesis that this gross loss of gene regulatory control underpins the multifarious toxicities of dioxin poisoning."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Murray Whitelaw","data":{"first_name":"Murray","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040430","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Whitelaw","source_individual_id":"RMIS443356","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Murray Whitelaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87475","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeffrey Gorman","data":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025137","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Gorman","source_individual_id":"RMIS80042","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jeffrey Gorman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83462","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61458","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Exploitation of unique growth factors to develop new products for infertility treatment","data":{"media_summary":"reproductive biology","end_year":2007,"keywords":["assisted reproductive medicine","embryo development","growth factor","in vitro fertilisation","oocyte maturation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453685,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["assisted reproductive technology","female infertility","in vitro fertilisation","in vitro maturation of oocytes","reproductive biology"],"scientific_title":"Exploitation of unique growth factors to develop new products for infertility treatment","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Robert Gilchrist","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453685","simplified_title":"Development of new products for infertility treatment","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"132525","source_system":"Infertility comes at an enormous social and financial cost to Australian society; infertility is a major psychological burden on young couples and the technologies used to treat infertility, such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), require expensive drugs to stimulate the ovary. The cost of these drugs to Medicare is expected to exceed $100 million p.a. over the next decade. A reproductive technology, which has always shown great potential to elevate some of this burden, is oocyte (egg) in vitro maturation (IVM), which drastically reduces the use-cost of drugs and the stress to patients. However, oocyte IVM has been slow to live up to its potential and the technology is still not in widespread clinical practice, mainly due to disappointing success rates in women. We have been studying oocyte IVM in animals for many years, and have recently made a significant technological breakthrough, improving success rates by ~50%. In this field, a 50% increase in efficiency is substantial and has significant clinical and commercial application. Currently, we are the only group worldwide with this technology. Over the course of this 2-year project we will conduct follow-up experiments to refine this discovery and investigate the feasibility of using this approach to treat human infertility. We are already in negotiations with two medical device manufacturers to licence this technology.

These signals and cells response are very important during embryonic development, when these signals cause a single cell to become a complete person, and also in adults. Here in the embryo, and also in adults, stem cells are very important because they can become many different kinds of cells, depending on what the body needs. When the signals don't work properly, they cause major problems and diseases, from birth defects, to cancer. Notch is an important protein involved in receiving and passing on certain signals, and is found in organisms as diverse as worms and humans. It tells cells, especially stem cells and other similar cells, when and how to change from one type of cell to another. For example, it is very important in the generation of many different types of blood cells from a single precursor cell. Notch has also been implicated in human diseases such as cancer, where signalling goes wrong and cells keep multiplying out of control, and also certain types of heart disease. Another protein, called FIH, is an oxygen sensor that signals to the cell when there is not enough oxygen around. FIH has also been implicated in cancer and heart disease. We have recently found evidence suggesting that FIH can also influence the activity of the Notch proteins. This means that oxygen levels can potentially have an effect on stem cells and other processes controlled by Notch, and may be very important in cancer and other diseases. This project will first confirm the connection between FIH and Notch. There are a number of different Notch proteins, so we will see if this connection works with all of them. It will also try and work out the consequence of this connection is and how important it is.

The symptoms of these diseases typically develop later in life - between the ages of 35 and 50 years. While the different genes for these diseases have been identified the pathways that lead from their similar form of mutation to their similar clinical outcomes are not yet understood. Some evidence suggests that certain of these diseases have a common toxic component but this component is not shared by all of the disease genes and so an additional agent that they have in common is being sought. This research will use a genetic model organism - the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to test the identity of a good candidate (RNA) for a common toxic agent and to provide information about the pathway by which RNA leads to nerve cell degeneration and death.

Its surrounding cells and fluid provide the oocyte with all of its required nutrients. I hypothesize that this follicular environment is altered in females that are obese leading to inappropriate nutritional signals and suboptimal development of the oocyte. The goals of my research are to use obese mice to 1) pinpoint exactly which metabolic alterations lead to decreased oocyte development; 2) determine how these metabolic alterations change the oocyte and the cells surrounding it; 3) use the information gained to analyse ovarian cells of women and see if these same alterations occur in women who are obese. The findings will be highly significant because they will 1) provide a greater understanding of how the maternal environment communicates nutritional information to the oocyte, which ultimately forms the developing embryo. 2) expand our knowledge of the optimal nutritional conditions for oocyte and early embryo development. 3) identify biological mechanisms that are altered during obesity and lead to decreased female fertility. 4) aid in the development of improved agents for use at fertility clinics, for instance the development of solutions most closely mimicking the critical components of the normal ovarian environment, for use in the culture of oocytes and embryos. 5) provide a strong public health message to women of reproductive age: to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight prior to becoming pregnant."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Rebecca Robker","data":{"first_name":"Rebecca","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027637","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Robker","source_individual_id":"RMIS4299714","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Rebecca Robker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84132","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61454","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Sleep disordered breathing and neurocognitive function in children post-adenotonsillectomy: Three year follow-up","data":{"media_summary":"underlying neurocognitive deficits","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Adenotonsillectomy","Paediatrics","Psychometric testing","Sleep breathing disorders","cognitive deficit"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453669,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Adenotonsillectomy","Child health","Information processing and learning","Sleep disordered breathing","underlying neurocognitive deficits"],"scientific_title":"Sleep disordered breathing and neurocognitive function in children post-adenotonsillectomy: Three year follow-up","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr John Kennedy","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453669","simplified_title":"Neurocognitive function in children 3 years after treatment for sleep breathing disorders","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"266536.68","source_system":"Snoring is very common and affects at least 10% of children, or an estimated 0.25 million children in Australia.

To our great surprise, at six months after surgery we found that although sleep and behaviour improves, intelligence, memory, reasoning and language development do not. We now wish to study these same children at 3 years after tonsils and adenoids removal, as we believe that if the deficits that we described at 6 months are still present, they are likely now to be permanent. Given the degree of deficit that we have found in snoring compared to non-snoring children, even 6 months after the snoring group of children have been treated, if still present at 3 years post-surgery then it is likely that these deficits will affect the children's future learning potential and academic success. In turn, this would suggest that early identification and treatment of sleep-related upper airway obstruction is critical in preventing long-term deficits in children's daytime functioning and behaviour."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Kennedy","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025945","middle_name":"Declan","last_name":"Kennedy","source_individual_id":"5015683","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr John Kennedy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83693","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kurt Lushington","data":{"first_name":"Kurt","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020519","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lushington","source_individual_id":"5016085","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Kurt Lushington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82241","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Alfred Martin","data":{"first_name":"Alfred","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014724","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS3011072","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Alfred Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80684","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Cameron Van Den Heuvel","data":{"first_name":"Cameron","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005184","middle_name":"Jay","last_name":"Van Den Heuvel","source_individual_id":"RMIS70646","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Cameron Van Den Heuvel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78107","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61453","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Androgen receptor signalling in development and progression of prostate cancer","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Androgen receptor","Androgen signalling axis","Animal model","Prostate cancer","Tissue microarrays"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453662,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Aging","Prostate cancer","Treatment failure"],"scientific_title":"Androgen receptor signalling in development and progression of prostate cancer","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453662","simplified_title":"Androgen receptor signalling in prostate cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"753420.1","source_system":"Prostate cancer is a major health problem in Australia, being the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. Although there have been improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, there are no effective treatments for advanced (metastatic) disease that has spread to other parts of the body. Currently, the only therapy for advanced disease involves the reduction in circulating androgens such as testosterone by surgical or medical castration, i.e. androgen ablation. Because prostate cells are dependent on testicular androgens for their growth and survival, surgical or medical castration results in an initial tumour regression. However, tumours inevitably develop resistance to androgen ablation therapy and regrow. In this study we aim to provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of the role of androgen signalling in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. This will enable us to identify the most effective means of eliminating androgen-dependent prostate tumours and identify tumours with high metastatic potential. Our studies will indicate whether treatments targeting androgen signalling are a more effective strategy to inhibit prostate cancer growth while minimising undesirable side effects."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Lisa Butler","data":{"first_name":"Lisa","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029717","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"5013717","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Lisa Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84691","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028408","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS102344","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Villis Marshall","data":{"first_name":"Villis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026522","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Marshall","source_individual_id":"5030803","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Villis Marshall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83856","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61452","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Does women's nutrition during pregnancy influence metabolic health of their children?","data":{"media_summary":"nutrition in pregnancy","end_year":2009,"keywords":["glucose tolerance in children","insulin","longitudinal study","maternal nutrition","metabolic programming"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453655,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["diabetes (type 2)","fetal and peri-natal growth","insulin resistance in children","metabolichomeostasis","nutrition in pregnancy"],"scientific_title":"Does women's nutrition during pregnancy influence metabolic health of their children?","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Vivienne Moore","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453655","simplified_title":"Does women's nutrition during pregnancy influence metabolic health of their children?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"255752.6","source_system":"The occurrence of type 2 diabetes is increasing around the world, with the rising incidence among children and adolescents especially worrying. Widespread obesity has clearly contributed to this epidemic, but does not fully explain it. Diabetes develops over many years and obesity appears to exacerbate a pre-existing susceptibility. Our work focuses on understanding and preventing this initial susceptibility. Metabolic changes in the way the body produces and disposes of insulin, and responds to glucose, are seen much earlier in individuals who become diabetic. These metabolic defects are thought to be due, in part, to sub-optimal growth and development before birth (affecting the way the pancreas and liver function, for example). Poor nutrition before birth may be an important underlying cause. Animal studies reliably demonstrate that a poor quality diet of the pregnant mother can result in offspring that have impaired glucose tolerance and related metabolic problems. We now need to determine whether this occurs in humans. A limited amount of community-based research suggests this is possible. The balance between carbohydrate and protein in the mother's diet may be a key factor, and possibly the type of carbohydrate (high or low glycaemic). Weight before and during pregnancy could also be influential. We have been following a cohort of 500 children from before birth, through childhood. We collected detailed information on the mothers' diets during pregnancy. In this project, we plan to assess the glucose-insulin metabolism of the children at 8 years of age. We will then investigate whether diet of the mothers during pregnancy affects the metabolism of the children later on. Improving nutrition of pregnant women could lead to life-long improvement in metabolic health of the children. This study will contribute to the evidence-base about whether maternal diet is important, and give specific details about what kinds of changes are needed."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Phillips","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033172","middle_name":"Iw","last_name":"Phillips","source_individual_id":"RMIS224148","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Phillips"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85597","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Vivienne Moore","data":{"first_name":"Vivienne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032669","middle_name":"","last_name":"Moore","source_individual_id":"RMIS62015","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Vivienne Moore"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85458","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julie Owens","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021301","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Owens","source_individual_id":"5012294","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Julie Owens"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82469","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Jeffrey Robinson","data":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004281","middle_name":"Samuel","last_name":"Robinson","source_individual_id":"5012009","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"E/Pr Jeffrey Robinson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77863","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61451","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Pathophysiology of postprandial hypotension in the elderly - role of \"gastric\" and \"small intestinal\" mechanisms","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["3D ultrasound","ageing","blood flow","nutrition in the aged","postprandial hypotension"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453650,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["ageing","nutrition in the aged","postprandial hypotension"],"scientific_title":"Pathophysiology of postprandial hypotension in the elderly - role of \"gastric\" and \"small intestinal\" mechanisms","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Karen Jones","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453650","simplified_title":"Mechanisms associated with falls in blood pressure after meals in the elderly","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"471176.76","source_system":"A fall in blood pressure after a meal (known as postprandial hypotension) is an important clinical problem, particularly in the elderly, occurring in ~50% of nursing home residents and ~30% of healthy older subjects. Postprandial hypotension is associated with a substantial increase in the incidence of falls, stroke, as well as mortality. The mechanisms responsible for the fall in blood pressure after a meal are not well understood, although changes in gastrointestinal blood flow and the release of gut hormones, have been implicated. While ingestion of carbohydrate, particularly glucose, has been reported to decrease blood pressure most potently, there is inadequate and conflicting information about the effects of other nutrients such as fat and protein. Current therapies are less than optimal. Studies by our research group have established that the fall in blood pressure in response to meals is related to the rate at which nutrients enter the small intestine ie the fall in blood pressure is greater when the stomach empties more quickly. In contrast, gastric distension reduces the fall in blood pressure. Hence, treatment could be directed at facilitating gastric distension and-or slowing the rate of nutrient delivery into the small intestine. Our previous studies have not included any assessment of changes in blood flow to the gut after meals, or of the interaction between gastric distension and small intestinal mechanisms, and have involved healthy older subjects and patients with type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes rather than individuals with known postprandial hypotension. We now have the capacity to measure blood flow in the gut with ultrasound. The studies proposed in the current application represent a logical development from our previous work and have important implications for the management of postprandial hypotension."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christopher Rayner","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045020","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Rayner","source_individual_id":"RMIS3691650","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Christopher Rayner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88656","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christine Feinle-Bisset","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030645","middle_name":"","last_name":"Feinle-Bisset","source_individual_id":"RMIS1585350","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Christine Feinle-Bisset"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84964","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ian Chapman","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029881","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Chapman","source_individual_id":"RMIS11738","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ian Chapman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84734","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Karen Jones","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002495","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Jones","source_individual_id":"5015532","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Karen Jones"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77345","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Horowitz","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002272","middle_name":"","last_name":"Horowitz","source_individual_id":"5020423","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77291","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61450","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Anatomical Template Mapping System","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Arrhythmia","Atrial Fibrillation","Electrophysiology","Ventricular Tachycardia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453649,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Arrhythmia","Diagnositic Techniques","Digital Imaging","Electrophysiology"],"scientific_title":"Anatomical Template Mapping System","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Advanced mapping systems utilize online visualization of catheters, 3D geometry, and annotation of ablation sites. To date, all commercially available systems rely on proprietary equipment to locate catheter positions and reconstruct chamber shape from multiple site recordings. Thus, cost is prohibitive, limiting widespread availability. An alternative approach has emerged with the use of CT-MRI imaging and analysis. Novel techniques extract images of the endocardial surface from CT-MRI for use in electrophysiological mapping. This surface can be used as the chamber geometry instead of reconstruction based on expensive technology measuring spatial coordinates of the catheter tip inside heart. The proposed Anatomical Template Mapping System (ATMS) will generate maps of electrophysiological parameters derived from catheter recordings without the need for proprietary equipment. The physician will direct the virtual catheter position onto the 3D model of the chamber, obviating the need for equipment to map the spatial distribution of the catheters. The major advantage is that, without the need for specialized equipment, this method of mapping is substantially cheaper and can be used with any conventional electrophysiological mapping systems.

Delayed stomach emptying, which was thought to be an infrequent complication of diabetes, may contribute to a number of problems including symptoms such as nausea and bloating, and poor control of blood glucose concentrations. The blood glucose level itself also has a reversible effect on both stomach contractions and symptoms; when the blood glucose is abnormally high, the rate at which the stomach empties is slower, and symptoms, such as fullness, are greater. The rate of stomach emptying and the absorption of sugar from the intestine have a major influence on the rise in the blood glucose level after a meal. This is important because in people with diabetes it is desirable to maintain blood glucose levels as close as possible to normal to minimise the risk of complications such as eye and nerve damage. Specific modifications in diet and recently developed drugs which have actions similar to that of the hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1, may improve blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes by slowing the rate of gastric emptying. People with cystic fibrosis frequently develop diabetes which is often difficult to manage; this may result from abnormally rapid gastric emptying and impaired release of hormones. If so, pancreatic enzyme replacement, in the form of tablets, should prove effective. Our group has conducted research in this area for about 24 years and have performed the most comprehensive studies to date resulting in international recognition.

This brain plasticity is a fundamental property of the nervous system, where it is critical for learning and memory, but is also important for recovery from brain injury. The goal of the proposed studies is to examine the extent of brain plasticity when performing fine motor skills in older adults, and relate this to motor performance and learning in the elderly. We will use three complementary approaches that will employ novel techniques of magnetic brain stimulation to achieve this goal. These studies will be the first to ascertain a link between deficits in brain plasticity and impaired manual performance in older adults. Furthermore, these studies will be the first to examine interventions designed to promote brain plasticity and motor performance in older adults.

Unfortunately, bony metastases usually occur before pre-emptive treatments can be applied to prevent it. We have recently shown that recombinant soluble TRAIL is a potent anticancer agent that prevents cancer-induced bone destruction in a mouse model by directly targeting cancer cells within bone, and with no evidence of toxic side effects to normal tissues. Death receptor targeting by TRAIL, and bisphosphonates induce cancer cell apoptosis through different but overlapping signaling pathways. Therefore, combination of the two approaches may facilitate killing of tumour cells that resist death induction through either one of the pathways. Combination therapy may also reduce the probability of acquired resistance to either therapy. We propose that a combinatorial approach, using bisphosphonates to selectively target osteoclasts and TRAIL to selectively target cancer cells, would be an ideal therapeutic and safe approach to delay, slow or completely eliminate growth of cancer within bone."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andreas Evdokiou","data":{"first_name":"Andreas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024742","middle_name":"","last_name":"Evdokiou","source_individual_id":"RMIS24665","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andreas Evdokiou"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83358","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61446","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional and epigenetic consequences of maternal folate deficiency, supplementation and fetal growth restriction","data":{"media_summary":"type 2 diabetes","end_year":2009,"keywords":["DNA methylation","epigenetics","fetal development","insulin","maternal nutrition"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453640,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["folic acid nutrition","intrauterine growth restriction","loss of imprinting","pregnancy complications","type 2 diabetes"],"scientific_title":"Functional and epigenetic consequences of maternal folate deficiency, supplementation and fetal growth restriction","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Julie Owens","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453640","simplified_title":"Maternal folate and epigenetic state and health of offspring in later life","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"545183.42","source_system":"Growing slowly before birth or being born early and premature are very common. Both conditions greatly increase the risk of illness or death around birth and of the infant developing major conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later life. Despite their importance, we understand little of what causes fetal growth failure or prematurity or why they influence an individual's health throughout life. Recent findings suggest that low levels of folate in the mother, due to either dietary or genetic factors, may be involved in their origins and their long-term outcomes. Folate is a nutrient required regularly in small amounts for growth and maintenance of health. Folate supplementation in women is currently recommended before and in early pregnancy, but may have a role throughout the whole of pregnancy in promoting growth and health of the infant. Using experimental models, this project will determine if too little or too much maternal folate modifies the genetic code of the infant (called epigenetic changes), which leads to later metabolic disease and high blood pressure. These epigenetic changes are mild and subtle chemical modifications of DNA that persist in the cells of the infant altering their function. The efficacy of maternal folate supplementation in improving these outcomes for the small baby will also be tested in the models. Finally, the effect of folate status in the normal and small human infant on the epigenetic state of their placenta, cord blood white blood cells and mucous cells of the mouth will be tested. These outcomes will enable the design and testing of interventions with folate and related nutrients in the mother to improve the health of their babies before birth and subsequently throughout their lives. Because these pregnancy complications of being born small or early are common and account for much of the diabetes that occurs in later life, the health benefits from development of effective interventions may be large."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Marie Dziadek","data":{"first_name":"Marie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0036426","middle_name":"Anna","last_name":"Dziadek","source_individual_id":"5011531","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Marie Dziadek"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86442","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julie Owens","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021301","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Owens","source_individual_id":"5012294","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Julie Owens"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82469","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Jeffrey Robinson","data":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004281","middle_name":"Samuel","last_name":"Robinson","source_individual_id":"5012009","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"E/Pr Jeffrey Robinson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77863","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61445","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Does adenotonsillectomy change vascular function in children with sleep breathing disorders?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["adenotonsillectomy","child health","endothelial dysfunction","sleep breathing disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453637,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["child health","sleep disordered breathing","vascular function"],"scientific_title":"Does adenotonsillectomy change vascular function in children with sleep breathing disorders?","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr John Kennedy","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453637","simplified_title":"Vascular function in children with sleep breathing disorders, before and after treatment","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"522105.03","source_system":"Sleep breathing disorders affect 10% of all children and when severe, obstruction in the upper airways causes serious deficits in growth, development, brain function and heart health. But even mild snoring (without obstruction) may also cause poor health in the arteries that supply blood to the brain and heart, as well as the smaller arteries in the arms and legs. In both adults and children with conditions like diabetes and obesity, poor blood vessel health has been shown to greatly increase the future risk of heart attacks, angina and strokes. Children with severe sleep breathing disorders (such as sleep apnoea syndrome) are currently treated by removal of the tonsils and adenoids, which typically resolves snoring and improves sleep, but it is not yet known whether there are any benefits for blood vessel health. The earliest signs of blood vessel disease in children are abnormal function of the lining of the blood vessels (endothelial dysfunction) and thickening of the lining of blood vessels (intima media thickness). They precede the adult diseases of atherosclerosis - which causes heart attacks and strokes, and diabetic kidney and eye disease. These changes can be measured accurately and non-invasively using ultrasound imaging of arteries in the neck and arm. Our primary aim is to assess whether changes in blood vessel health occur in children with sleep breathing disorders across the range of severity, with a secondary aim to measure any changes in cardiovascular control during both sleep (when snoring occurs). Most importantly, by assessing children before and after surgery, we will be able to see for the first time whether treatment of childhood snoring improves blood vessel health. This study may have major implications for the clinical management of snoring children, who may require treatment at an earlier age to prevent poor blood vessel health and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases later in life."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Couper","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041789","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Couper","source_individual_id":"RMIS23780","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Couper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87844","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Kennedy","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025945","middle_name":"Declan","last_name":"Kennedy","source_individual_id":"5015683","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr John Kennedy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83693","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Alfred Martin","data":{"first_name":"Alfred","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014724","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS3011072","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Alfred Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80684","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Cameron Van Den Heuvel","data":{"first_name":"Cameron","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005184","middle_name":"Jay","last_name":"Van Den Heuvel","source_individual_id":"RMIS70646","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Cameron Van Den Heuvel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78107","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Mathias Baumert","data":{"first_name":"Mathias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000279","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baumert","source_individual_id":"RMIS4496643","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Mathias Baumert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76731","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61444","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"If childhood primary snoring resolves, do neurocognition and behaviour also improve?","data":{"media_summary":"Underlying neurocognitive deficits","end_year":2010,"keywords":["Behavioural problems","Child health","Cognitive deficit","Neurocognitive assessment","Sleep breathing disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453636,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Behaviour","Child health","Sleep disordered breathing","Snoring","Underlying neurocognitive deficits"],"scientific_title":"If childhood primary snoring resolves, do neurocognition and behaviour also improve?","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr John Kennedy","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453636","simplified_title":"If childhood primary snoring resolves, do neurocognition and behaviour also improve?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"568067.6","source_system":"Sleep breathing disorders (SBD) are common and affect around 10% of all children. Previous research however has shown that sleep disorders are often not recognised or considered important enough to report to general practitioners. Thus, the true incidence of sleep disorders in Australian children is not known. Nevertheless, even the mildest SBD, primary snoring, has been associated with significant deficits in daytime learning, memory, intelligence, attention and problematic behaviour. In severe cases of childhood SBD (i.e. sleep apnoea syndrome), removal of the tonsils and adenoids has been shown to improve the learning and behaviour problems. Thus there is increasing pressure on doctors to treat primary snoring in children with surgery to improve their intellectual functioning. However, recent evidence in children has shown that snoring may resolve naturally in up to 50% of cases over one to two years. In addition to the risks of surgery, the large number of children who may have a natural resolution of snoring suggestst that the pressure to treat primary snoring in may not be justified. This study will be the first to determine the prevalence of childhood snoring and associated problems in the Australian community. We also aim to discover whether snoring and the associated intellectual deficits persist over time during childhood. We will identify frequent snorers and healthy non-snorers in children aged 5-10 years old, using parental questionnaires. We will then study 75 snorers and 75 non-snorers in more detail, monitoring them with overnight sleep studies and questionnaires 2 years apart, to see if snoring, intellectual function and behavioural problems persist over time.

We have been able to show that repeat doses of corticosteroids before birth significantly reduces the risk of the baby developing respiratory difficulties after birth from 41.4% to 32.8%. However, we are not sure if this potentially important improvement will translate into better outcomes for the children as they grow older and reach school-age. As there are many examples of treatments given around the time of birth that have been shown to have some short-term benefits, but substantial long-term harms, we must be as certain as we can be that any advance in one small area of health is not counterbalanced by disadvantages in other health areas. This is particularly important to find out for repeat antenatal corticosteroids given the earlier conflicting reports from non-randomised studies. We plan to assess the 1085 survivors from our earlier clinical trial of repeat dose of prenatal corticosteroids when they are of early school age. We will assess their movement and other important areas of their brain function, as well as their school progress, blood pressure, lung function and general health and growth. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE RESEARCH If we find important improvements in health outcomes at school-age in children exposed to repeat corticosteroids, without any substantial couterbalancing adverse effects, repeat steroids will be recommended standard therapy in women who are likely to give birth to their baby very early.

Imbalances in female androgen activity could account for approximately 50% of female infertility, but exactly how androgens behave in women is not well understood. Making too much androgen is the most common hormonal problem experienced by women in their reproductive years, and it affects the ovary in a way that can cause infertility. Women with this problem have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Gaining weight increases the chance of having problems with fertility and increases the risk of diabetes and heart problems in women with PCOS. The cause of PCOS is unknown, but it can occur in families, which indicates that some genetic factor is involved. On the other hand, the concept that some women do not produce enough androgen is only beginning to emerge and remains a controversial topic among medical experts. Part of the problem with this notion is that normal female androgen levels are very difficult to measure accurately, so no one can say for certain how much is too little. A recent scientific study in female mice indicates that poor androgen action causes infertility early in life because the ovary is ageing too quickly. A similar thing could possibly occur in women, but this has never been scientifically explored. However, we have some early evidence that shows abnormally low androgen levels in infertile women with signs of early aging in the ovary. Our study aims to understand the role that androgens play in normal and abnormal ovarian function. A large part of this study involves investigation of the androgen receptor, a molecule that controls what androgens can do inside body organs. We think that abnormal activity of this receptor will be involved in ovarian diseases that cause infertility in women. This understanding may lead to new means of diagnosing and treating infertility in women."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028408","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS102344","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Theresa Hickey","data":{"first_name":"Theresa","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019602","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Hickey","source_individual_id":"RMIS4495795","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Theresa Hickey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81989","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Norman","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003703","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Norman","source_individual_id":"RMIS31138","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Norman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77692","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61441","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Determination of irradiation dose efficacy for use in impaction grafting at revision joint replacement","data":{"media_summary":"infection","end_year":2009,"keywords":["allograft irradiation","bioburden","joint disease","mechanical testing","revision hip replacement"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453624,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["bone graft","bone loss","clinical patient management","hip replacement","infection"],"scientific_title":"Determination of irradiation dose efficacy for use in impaction grafting at revision joint replacement","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Donald Howie","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453624","simplified_title":"Effective dose of irradiation that preserves the properties of bone graft for use at revision joint replacement","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"411517.43","source_system":"Primary hip replacement is a successful intervention for hip disease, but 10-15% of hip prostheses fail and require revision surgery within 10-15 years. At the time of revision, significant bone loss around the failed prosthesis is not uncommon. A bone reconstruction procedure, called impaction grafting, where donor bone is minced and placed in the areas of deficient bone before implanting the new prosthesis, has shown to give good results at more than ten years in some centres. A high incidence of early complications of this procedure have included loss of fixation within the bone. Fracture of the bone around prostheses has also reported in some centres. These events require more surgery, putting the patient at higher risk greater complications and longer rehabilitations. Recent improvements in surgical technique and donor bone preparation have improved results. A current debate questions whether the dose of irradiation can be reduced from 25 kGy, while maintaining sterility of allografts. The risk of bacterial contamination in allografts is low, and irradiation reduces the mechanical strength of the graft, contributing to complications when irradiated bone is used. The benefits of decontaminating the bone may be outweighed by the higher risk for failure due to poor bone quality and resulting prosthesis instability. We will use ISO standards to test the validity of radiation dose for sterilising bone ex vivo. In the absence of controlled human studies, our aim is also to compare the results of impaction grafting with non-irradiated bone versus bone irradiated at current doses used by Australian bone banks, and lower doses indicated by ex vivo testing. We will use a large animal model of revision hip replacement, with precise measures of prosthesis stability.

The PRESENILIN genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2, are the major sites for mutations causing inherited AD and are also implicated in cancer. Using the zebrafish embryo model we have discovered that, contrary to current thought, mutations that truncate presenilin proteins potently suppress normal presenilin activity. (They are so called, dominant negatives). This means that they are lethal for embryo development and explains why such mutations have never been found in inherited AD. Notably, this discovery could only be made using a subtle form of gene manipulation that is possible in zebrafish embryos. Our work has also established the first assay for the non-apoptotic (non-cell death) function of PSEN2 and has shown that PSEN2 activity is inhibited by truncated PSEN1. This is the first indication of possible interaction between PSEN1 and PSEN2 proteins at normal physiological expression levels. Loss of presenilin activity promotes cancer. Truncated presenilin proteins could be produced by errors in gene transcription (aberrant transcript splicing) common in cancerous cells. This suggests that truncated, dominant negative forms of presenilin produced through aberrant splicing (or mutation in precancerous cells) might be common in tumour formation. The proposed research will define the region of PSEN1 in which truncation leads to dominant negative activity. This will allow further examination of the role of presenilins in the cell signalling pathways involved in AD and cancer. We will also investigate the role that age-related truncation of presenilins in human cells can play in the formation of sporadic AD. This may reveal a common molecular link between the inherited and sporadic forms of this disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michael Lardelli","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031951","middle_name":"Trent","last_name":"Lardelli","source_individual_id":"RMIS12265","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michael Lardelli"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85262","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ralph Martins","data":{"first_name":"Ralph","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003212","middle_name":"Nigel","last_name":"Martins","source_individual_id":"RMIS145635","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ralph Martins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77556","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61439","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Understanding the function of the CCR7 chemokine receptor in breast cancer cells and tumours.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["breast cancer","cancer biology","metastasis","tumourigenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453612,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["chemokine","metastasis","murine model","signal transduction"],"scientific_title":"Understanding the function of the CCR7 chemokine receptor in breast cancer cells and tumours.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Shaun McColl","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453612","simplified_title":"CCR7 in breast cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"549446.74","source_system":"As much as 90% of cancer related deaths occur due to the development of metastatic tumours, and to be able to develop efficient therapies for malignant cancers it is necessary to uncover and study in detail the specific characteristics that allow cancer cells to disseminate from the site of primary tumour.

Tooth decay affects approximately 1 in 6 children by age of 3 years and 1 in 2 children by age of 5 years. The disease negatively influences all aspects of quality of life of child. Tooth decay is associated with infection, pain, and frequent hospitalisation. The proposed project is a follow-up of an randomised controlled trial (RCT), which started with enrolment of pregnant women. They were randomised into the test and control groups. Mothers in test group received 3 round of preventive oral health information in the form of anticipatory guidance, the first round at enrolment, the second and third at 6, 12 months of age of child respectively. The information was mailed to their home address. All children were examined at age of 20 months of age. The children in the test group had lower prevalence of tooth decay compared to children in control group, (test group 1,7%, control group 9.6%). While the oral health information was effective in preventing decay at 20 months, longer-term follow-up is highly desirable. Therefore, we plan to follow-up the oral health of the children at 5 - 6 years old. It is anticipated, that 75% mothers from the trial will be contactable and will continue with their participation in the study. A third comparative group of children at the same age will be drawn from database of the South Australian School Dental Services to check if the children in the trial are representative of all SA school children. All children will be examined by dentists or school dental therapists after they enter school. The prevalence of the tooth decay and its mangement will be examined and compared among children from test and control groups and children from community."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Gary Slade","data":{"first_name":"Gary","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0045464","middle_name":"","last_name":"Slade","source_individual_id":"RMIS2290716","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Gary Slade"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88759","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof A.

Disruption of this process is the cause of many bone-related diseases that affect millions of Australians and countless others worldwide. It is controlled by the complex interactions of a large number of systemic factors (hormones) and locally acting agents, such as chemokines and cytokines, the details of which are not fully understood. Each of these factors, however, is a potential therapeutic target. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, those that are associated with inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), are known to have key roles in both the physiology and pathology of bone. TWEAK is a recently described member of the TNF family of cytokines. We have shown that TWEAK is a novel mediator of inflammatory arthritis in mouse model systems and is therefore a likely candidate as a therapeutic target. We now have extensive preliminary data to suggest that TWEAK is involved in human RA, and also in the regulation of normal bone remodelling. TWEAK therefore may be implicated in a wide spread of bone diseases, including osteoporosis. We believe it is of great importance to perform a thorough analysis of TWEAK in bone biology, and we propose to do so."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Timothy Zheng","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017325","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Zheng","source_individual_id":"RMIS4342477","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Timothy Zheng"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81413","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017304","middle_name":"Christopher William","last_name":"Zannettino","source_individual_id":"RMIS362660","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81407","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins","data":{"first_name":"Gerald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005872","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Atkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS228986","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78304","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Haynes","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002107","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Haynes","source_individual_id":"RMIS18488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Haynes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77248","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61436","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells","data":{"media_summary":"Tissue Engineering","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Periodontics","Tissue Engineering","Tissue Regeneration"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453599,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Dentistry","Fibroblasts","Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Periodontics","Tissue Engineering"],"scientific_title":"Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dentistry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Peter Bartold","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453599","simplified_title":"Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"608741.76","source_system":"Dental diseases affecting the gums (periodontal diseases) are extremely prevalent in our society.

Not only do these studies enable researchers to more clearly determine the exact age of onset of disorder but they also give us insight into the background and hence possible risk factors that may have lead to the development of that disorder. Early identification of disorder can significantly reduce public health cost and reduce the burden on the community by enabling individuals to get help before their symptoms become too severe and unmanageable. Few long-term studies have investigated the combined role of pre-natal, developmental, parental characteristics, biological and childhood cognitive risk factors in the development of adult psychiatric dysfunction. Even fewer studies have examinined this interrelationship in a group of individuals who have been exposed to an environmental toxin such as lead. This study will follow-up 723 adults from the lead smelting city of Port Pirie who were originally recruited between 1979 and 1982.

New research suggests that a woman's genetic potential, her lifestyle and the physical and socioeconomic environment in which she lives, and her biological and social relationship with her male partner, all impact on the long term health of her baby. Abnormal events around the time of conception and in early pregnancy can predispose a newborn to later occurrence, in adult life, of conditions including heart disease, diabetes, obesity and stroke. These adverse events originate in the way that eggs and sperm develop, the uterus is prepared for implantation, the attachment of the early embryo to the lining of the uterus and subsequent growth of the placenta. This Program will study the early life events that promote or limit development of a baby's true potential for successful and healthy life. A better understanding of how lifestyle and environment interact with genes and biology to facilitate optimal growth of the fetus will underpin new preventative measures and therapeutic treatments for infertility, miscarriage and other reproductive disorders. The knowledge gained will inform health policy and clinical practise to improve reproductive health in all Australian women and promote healthy development in all Australian children. The team of researchers is a world-class group of clinicians, scientists and epidemiologists who have made major contributions to our understanding of this area. This team will interface with clinics and hospitals that engage with women prior to and during pregnancy, while having the influence to alter clinical and health practices as well as public health policies.

Therefore, this provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. However, the manner by which cells regulate sphingosine kinase is not well known. It is known that phosphorylation of sphingosine kinase increases the activity of this enzyme, and also causes a shift in its localisation the the plasma membrane. We have found that both of these processes are essential for the tumorigenic effects of sphingosine kinase, but very little is known about how these processes are achieved in the cell.

These have health benefits in adult conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease, and they are necessary for proper brain and eye development in infants. However, much of the population does not like to eat fish and also, world fish stocks are under stress. Thus, a sustainable alternative source of omega-3 fats needs to be explored. Some vegetable oils such as canola, echium, and flaxseed oils have omega-3 fats. However, these are not the same as the omega-3s in fish oil. In general, vegetable omega-3s are known as short-chain omega-3s whereas those in fish are long-chain. When the vegetable oil omega-3s are consumed in the diet, the body must convert them to the fish-type, or long-chain, omega-3s in order to gain the health benefits. Currently, human metabolism is poor at doing this conversion. Our studies suggest that the amounts and blends of fats in most diets are well below optimal for conversion to long-chain omega-3s in the body. In particular, our studies show that there may be no point in simply adding more vegetable omega-3 fats to the diet. This project will examine the enzymes that convert the short-chain to the long-chain omega-3 fats. In particular, it will examine how the dietary fats interact with each other in detrimental ways to suppress activity of the conversion enzymes necessary for long-chain omega-3 formation. Evidence for the health benefits of fish-based omega-3 fats is very strong and it is an approach to health that most people can undertake on their own. Our lack of knowledge of the best way to use plant-based omega-3 fats is a large impediment for a more sustainable and broader based use of omega-3 fats. The results from this study will begin to fill in this knowledge gap. The results will be useful across a range of activities that are determinants of the kinds of fat that we eat. These include oil seed breeding, food manufacture, and dietetics."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Rebecca Cook-Johnson","data":{"first_name":"Rebecca","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041747","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Cook-Johnson","source_individual_id":"RMIS4496049","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Rebecca Cook-Johnson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87828","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael James","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031542","middle_name":"John","last_name":"James","source_individual_id":"RMIS5607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael James"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85164","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Gibson","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leslie Cleland","data":{"first_name":"Leslie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018309","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Cleland","source_individual_id":"RMIS120886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leslie Cleland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81689","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Susan Lester","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0008623","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Lester","source_individual_id":"RMIS4496052","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Susan Lester"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79038","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61428","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Maintenance of bone strength in aged rats: the Vitamin D requirement","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Bone architecture","Hip fracture","Osteomalacia","Osteoporosis","Vitamin D"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453510,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Ageing","Hip fracture","Nutrition","Osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Maintenance of bone strength in aged rats: the Vitamin D requirement","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Howard Morris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453510","simplified_title":"Vitamin D requirement to make strong bones","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"543301.76","source_system":"Hip fracture remains the most devastating of the osteoporotic fractures particularly in women in whom the incidence increases to about 3% per annum by the ninth decade.

It is designed to inhibit the kinase activity of BCR-ABL, a mutant protein found in some cases of leukaemia, particularly chronic myeloid leukaemia. Blocking the kinase activity of BCR-ABL has proven to be highly effective therapy for most patients, achieving prolonged remissions and significantly improving survival. However resistance to imatinib is a problem, including failure to respond to imatinib, loss of response, and long term persistence of low levels of leukaemia. New ABL kinase inhibitors (AKIs) have been developed that are more potent than imatinib, but they also appear to be prone to resistance. One potentially important cause of resistance to AKIs is the ability of some leukaemic cells to modify their cellular pathways to reduce the effective concentration of the drug by either reducing its movement into the cell (influx) or increasing its movement out (efflux). We will investigate the mechanisms used by resistant leukaemic cells to reduce intracellular drug levels of these AKIs and test ways of countering these effects by blocking the proteins responsible for drug efflux or promoting drug influx. These studies will use our stored collections of leukaemic cells from responsive and resistant patients to determine the importance of specific influx and efflux pumps. It will help to identify patients where this form of resistance is limiting response. This may allow us to develop more effective AKIs that are less prone to these forms of drug resistance. We will also test whether other anti-cancer drugs have an impact on AKI drug transport because this could reduce the effectiveness of combination treatment. The effects on drug transport of concomitant administration of commonly used drugs together with AKIs will also be studied because this can reduce the effectiveness of AKis or in some cases improve their effectiveness by increasing their uptake and retention."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Junia Vaz De Melo","data":{"first_name":"Junia","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038518","middle_name":"","last_name":"Vaz De Melo","source_individual_id":"5018089","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Junia Vaz De Melo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86976","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Timothy Hughes","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013791","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Hughes","source_individual_id":"5015370","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Timothy Hughes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80415","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61426","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Clonal proliferation of hepatocytes and progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis B virus infection","data":{"media_summary":"Viral-induced cancer/oncogenesis","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Hepatocyte proliferation","Hepatocytes","In situ hybridization","Inverse nested PCR","Viral persistence"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453507,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Chronic hepatitis B virus infection","Cirrhosis of the liver","Hepatocellular carcinoma","Viral hepatitis","Viral-induced cancer/oncogenesis"],"scientific_title":"Clonal proliferation of hepatocytes and progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis B virus infection","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453507","simplified_title":"Clonal proliferation of hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B virus infection","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"420558.42","source_system":"Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can lead to either acute resolving, or chronic HBV infection. Chronic HBV infections are often associated with severe liver disease, and increased risk of liver cancer and occur worldwide in 350 million people. HBV infects hepatocytes, the major cell of the liver. Early during infection 100% of hepatocytes are infected. However, this percentage declines over time to 10-50% or less. The reasons for this are unknown. We suggest that changes in the liver cell population occur because of the immune response against infected hepatocytes. We hypothesize that the immune response kills infected hepatocytes and provides and growth advantage to hepatocytes that can no longer be infected with HBV. This leads to the clonal proliferation of HBV-negative hepatocytes that over time become the major cell population in the liver. We will study human liver tissue using molecular techniques to detect the HBV DNA that integrates randomly into cell DNA during HBV infection. We will then determine the copy number of specific integrated virus-cell junctions as a measure of hepatocyte proliferation. Sections of fixed liver will also be examined for changes in histology and frequency of HBV infection. These studies will determine if foci of HBV-negative hepatocytes are clonal. This finding would suggest that a major role of the immune system in the development of liver cancer is to restrict the genetic pool of hepatocytes. We hypothesise that liver cancer beings with a very specific survival advantage for hepatocytes that lack HBV replication and antigen expression, and that proliferation of these cells expands the pool of potentially altered HCC precursor cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr William Mason","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020669","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Mason","source_individual_id":"RMIS3737457","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr William Mason"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82282","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Hugh Harley","data":{"first_name":"Hugh","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019464","middle_name":"Alexander John","last_name":"Harley","source_individual_id":"RMIS2483793","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Hugh Harley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81955","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert","data":{"first_name":"Allison","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002447","middle_name":"Rae","last_name":"Jilbert","source_individual_id":"RMIS72170","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77334","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61425","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Immune therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus infection","data":{"media_summary":"Vaccine development","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Antiviral","Duck hepatitis B virus","Humoral and cellular immunity","Prime-boost vaccination","Recombinant fowlpoxviruses"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453506,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Antiviral therapy","Chronic hepatitis B virus infection","Chronic liver disease","Immunotherapy","Vaccine development"],"scientific_title":"Immune therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus infection","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453506","simplified_title":"Immune therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus infection","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"359085.05","source_system":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic infection leading to severe liver damage in many patients and increased risk of primary liver cancer. Worldwide ~350 million people have chronic HBV infection and, while a HBV vaccine is available that protects against new infections, current antiviral drug treatments for existing infection are largely ineffective. Thus, the aim of our project is to develop new treatments for chronic HBV infection using vaccination approaches. These therapies will be tested in ducks infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), a model for human HBV infection. In brief, DHBV-infected ducks will be treated with a new antiviral drug, Entecavir (ETV) developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which blocks virus replication. To accelerate clearance of infected cells before drug-resistant viruses can emerge, the ducks will also be treated in combination with different novel therapeutic vaccines designed to induce strong humoral and cell mediated immune responses. Based on outcomes in initial experiments, we will adjust the vaccination protocol in ETV-treated ducks to maximize reductions in the levels of DHBV in liver and bloodstream, rates of death and clearance of DHBV-infected hepatocytes. Our ultimate goal is to define a protocol for combination antiviral and vaccination treatments that allows elimination of HBV infection, or that achieves a level of control of infection that eliminates ongoing disease by reducing virus loads to virtually undetectable levels."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert","data":{"first_name":"Allison","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002447","middle_name":"Rae","last_name":"Jilbert","source_individual_id":"RMIS72170","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77334","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61424","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Resolution of acute hepatitis B virus infections","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Covalently closed circular DNA","Cytokine mediated effects","Hepatocyte death and proliferation","Histological techniques","Inverse nested PCR"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453505,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Hepatocellular carcinoma","Liver disease","Resolution of hepatitis B virus infection","Therapy for chronic infection"],"scientific_title":"Resolution of acute hepatitis B virus infections","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Infectious Diseases","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453505","simplified_title":"Resolution of acute hepatitis B virus infections","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"364185.05","source_system":"Though vaccination has had a major impact on the number of persons becoming infected, chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) still remains a major worldwide problem, with 350 million people chronically infected.

Current treatments for chronic HBV infection have a low success rate (~20%) and patients with chronic infection are expected to die prematurely due to chronic liver disease or primary liver cancer. Interestingly, exposure to HBV can lead to either acute resolving or chronic HBV infection. Like chronic infections, acute infections involve spread of virus to virtually every hepatocyte, followed by rapid clearance of the virus mediated by the host immune response. Our immediate aim is to study the resolution of acute HBV infections to determine how the stable intracellular viral genome, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), is cleared from the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. Our broad long-term aim is to develop new and effective treatments for chronic HBV infection based on a better understanding of how acute HBV infections are resolved by the host. Based on our previous work we believe that clearance of cccDNA requires hepatocyte death, together with compensatory proliferation of other infected hepatocytes. We will perform detailed studies in duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infected ducks to determine if hepatocyte death and compensatory proliferation are essential to clear the infection, or if mechanisms exist for clearance that do not involve cell destruction."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr William Mason","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020669","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Mason","source_individual_id":"RMIS3737457","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr William Mason"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82282","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert","data":{"first_name":"Allison","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002447","middle_name":"Rae","last_name":"Jilbert","source_individual_id":"RMIS72170","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77334","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61423","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of TWIST family basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription Factors in Bone Cell Commitment, Function and Repair","data":{"media_summary":"genetics of fracture","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Bone","Fractures","osteoblast","osteogenesis","stem cells"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453497,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["bone development","bone formation","bone growth and fracture healing","bone marrow stroma","genetics of fracture"],"scientific_title":"The role of TWIST family basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription Factors in Bone Cell Commitment, Function and Repair","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Stan Gronthos","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453497","simplified_title":"The role of factors that regulate early processes of bone cell development","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"485928.39","source_system":"In developed countries, projected estimates predict an alarming trend of a two to three fold increase in the number of fractures that require surgical intervention and rehabilitation therapy in the coming decades as a consequence of an aging population.

MM is a cancer of plasma cells, which in their normal non-cancerous form, reside in lymph nodes and produce antibodies against infectious agents. When they become cancerous, they migrate or home to congenial sites within the bone marrow (BM). This directed movement or homing occurs under the influence of a chemokine molecule called CXCL12 which acts as a calling card for plasma cells to leave the lymph node and migrate to the BM. Once within the BM, the cells rapidly grow in response to BM-derived growth factors. This rapid growth causes a depletion in oxygen availability within the tumour and it becomes hypoxic. In response to this hypoxia, the tumour expresses a gene called hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) which regulates the expression of many proteins, including the chemokine CXCL12. Our studies show that the abnormal expression of CXCL12 by the plasma cells acts to promote blood vessel formation within the tumour, which in turn leads to greater tumour growth. In addition, our studies suggest that abnormal CXCL12 expression also promotes the recruitment and activation of large numbers of osteoclast (OC) precursors form the peripheral blood. OC are cells which normally remove unwanted or damaged bone. This proposal will study the interplay between HIF and CXCL12 in the establishment and development of MM and the associated bone destruction."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Daniel Peet","data":{"first_name":"Daniel","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039025","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Peet","source_individual_id":"RMIS443359","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Daniel Peet"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87112","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stan Gronthos","data":{"first_name":"Stan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036999","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gronthos","source_individual_id":"5012434","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stan Gronthos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86577","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andreas Evdokiou","data":{"first_name":"Andreas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024742","middle_name":"","last_name":"Evdokiou","source_individual_id":"RMIS24665","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andreas Evdokiou"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83358","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017304","middle_name":"Christopher William","last_name":"Zannettino","source_individual_id":"RMIS362660","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81407","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Luen To","data":{"first_name":"Luen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005052","middle_name":"Bik","last_name":"To","source_individual_id":"RMIS379055","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Luen To"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78077","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61421","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular Mechanisms of Lymphangiogenesis in Development and Disease.","data":{"media_summary":"tumour metastasis","end_year":2009,"keywords":["angiogenesis","endothelial cells","lymphatics","macrophage","vascular development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453493,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["fetal hydrops/oedema","inflammatory diseases","lymphatic disease","lymphoedema","tumour metastasis"],"scientific_title":"Molecular Mechanisms of Lymphangiogenesis in Development and Disease.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

The transport of cells of the immune system that fight infection. Abnormalities in the development and function of lymphatic vessels are associated with a large number of human diseases. These include primary and secondary lymphoedema, inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and and asthma, and malignancies of the lymphatic vessels such as lymphangiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Lymphatic vessels are also critical for the progression of many forms of cancer, by virtue of the fact that tumour cells exploit lymphatic vessels as a transport route for metastases. Diseases in which lymphatic vessels are involved therefore impact on a significant proportion of the Australian population. Our current knowledge of the mechanisms by which the lymphatic vascular network is constructed during embryonic development, and deregulated in disease states, is extremely limited. Once the molecular mechanisms of disease origin are established, much needed novel therapeutics to treat patients suffering from lymphatic vascular diseases can be designed. Treatments targeted to prevent the aberrant growth of lymphatic vessels are vital to halt tumour metastasis and the progress of inflammatory diseases, while treatments targeted to stimulate the development of new lymphatic vessels are necessary to treat diseases in which lymphatic vessels are hypoplastic, such as lymphoedema.

To understand and treat cancers that result from aberrant apoptosis we need to know at a molecular level how apoptosis is regulated. Central to the apoptosis execution are a group of enzymes called caspases that target many cellular proteins for specific cleavage. In this proposal, we will investigate the function of one of the caspases (called caspase-2), in order to better understand its potential role in the apoptosis of cancer cells. A number of recent reports suggest that caspase-2 levels are reduced in many cancer cells. The human caspase-2 gene localizes to a chromosomal region frequently affected- deleted in leukaemia, and caspase-2 levels have been proposed to be predictors of remission and survival in patients with some types of leukaemia. We will study if loss of caspase-2 in cancer cells makes them resistant to killing by drugs and if mice lacking caspase-2 have an increased potential to develop cancer.

Two-thirds of patients will also develop brain disease. The lysosome is a component of each cell in the human body; its role it is to break down and remove waste from the cell. This involves a series of proteins (enzymes) that act in sequence. A LSD arises when the lysosome lacks the activity of one protein in this chain. This loss of protein activity means that the waste removal process is impaired. Waste begins to 'store', clogging the cell and interfering with its usual functions. This gives rise to devastating symptoms that worsen over time as storage increases. Brain disease in LSD has profound effects on the child: mental capacity declines, they become hyperactive and aggressive and progressively lose learned skills (e.g. walking, talking) and control of bodily functions. Mucopolysaccharidosis (or MPS) type IIIA is a LSD that affects the brain. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is an accepted treatment for many diseases, including cancer. However, unlike cancer and some LSD, BMT does not work in MPS IIIA children. The reasons for this are unknown. This project is important in understanding the basic mechanisms that prevent this form of therapy from working in these children. If we can understand what prevents its effectiveness, we can devise methods to overcome it and potentially offer MPS IIIA (and other LSD that do not respond to BMT) a viable treatment option.

Current treatments (other than lung transplant) can only slow the inevitable decline in lung health. Early death from lung failure occurs for many with CF. We have developed a gene transfer technique to introduce the corrective gene (CFTR) into CF-diseased airway cells. We have used airways in mice to test and develop this method, to determine if long-lasting genetic correction of the airway cells can be achieved. The gene is introduced into the airway as a single small dose of special delivery-particles (vector) that have been built using highly-modified components of the HIV-1 virus. If ultimately successful in humans with CF, the disease should be halted, or even cured. Our recent work indicates that we have been able to insert the gene into airway progenitor cells, confirming our hypothesis that long-lasting gene expression can be achieved this way. To know if the method would be safe and effective in humans, we must now test the technique in sheep (as a human-size lung) and in marmosets (as a human-like lung) before clinical trials could be considered. We will monitor animals for up to 3 years to be sure the effect of the gene is truly long-lasting, and we will document how the gene-transfer vector disappears from the body. We have also discovered a new way to examine the detail of the very thin fluid layer on the airway surface. This fluid is too shallow in CF airway (allowing bacteria to stick and start disease) and so a successful gene therapy should return the fluid to it's proper depth. This method uses X-ray light from a synchrotron, and we expect it will work without the need to sacrifice animals to measure the airway surface. If successful it also has potential to be used much like a normal X-ray in humans with CF, to test if a gene therapy has worked."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Parsons","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044718","middle_name":"Webb","last_name":"Parsons","source_individual_id":"RMIS199391","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Parsons"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88567","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Donald Anson","data":{"first_name":"Donald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035119","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Anson","source_individual_id":"RMIS9114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Donald Anson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86105","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Karen Siu","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0022156","middle_name":"Kit Wan","last_name":"Siu","source_individual_id":"5017569","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Karen Siu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82707","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Timothy Kuchel","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0008474","middle_name":"Rex","last_name":"Kuchel","source_individual_id":"RMIS5851176","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Timothy Kuchel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78989","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Greg Smith","data":{"first_name":"Greg","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004717","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"RMIS4312147","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Greg Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77984","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61416","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid analogues in the treatment of diabetic complications","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Fatty acids","Mesangial Cells","Protein C Kinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453464,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Diabetes","Hyperglyceamia","Nephropathy","retinopathy"],"scientific_title":"Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid analogues in the treatment of diabetic complications","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Antonio Ferrante","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453464","simplified_title":"Healthy fats for managing diabetes","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"418446.74","source_system":"Treatment of diabetes has become an even greater challenge to our community today.

They result from a reduction or total deficiency of an enzyme required for the removal of carbohydrate structures called glycosaminoglycans (gags). Gag degradation occurs inside the cell in specific organelles termed lysosomes and in the absence of the appropriate enzyme, undegraded gag accumulates in the cell. This leads to a range of clinical symptoms and multiple tissue failure. Symptoms common to more than one MPS type include mental deterioration, blindness, abdominal organ enlargement and bone growth problems leading to short stature and bone loss. My laboratory has had a long-term interest in developing treatment for MPS and our research led to the clinical implementation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for MPS VI in 2005. While providing the first effective, multi-tissue treatment for MPS, our research showed that several tissues were not responsive to ERT. These are the brain, cartilage and cornea, thus children on ERT regimens will still suffer from mental retardation, arthritis and blindness. With the goal of treating these particular tissues we have developed a new approach to MPS therapy called substrate deprivation therapy (SDT). Instead of adding back the missing enzyme, SDT acts by decreasing gag production which in turn reduces the level of accumulated gag in cells. SDT results in the correction of MPS cells in culture and reduces several key clinical symptoms in the mouse model of MPS IIIA. In this proposal we will extend our research to evaluate the effect of SDT on brain and bone-joint pathology. Evaluation of efficacy will take place in the MPS VII mouse which exhibits both brain and bone disease and in a new model of MPS IVA developed specifically for this study which exhibits a joint pathology unique amongst the MPS disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Sharon Byers","data":{"first_name":"Sharon","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029728","middle_name":"","last_name":"Byers","source_individual_id":"5013734","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Sharon Byers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84693","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61414","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigating the role of the UPF3B gene and nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) process in mental retardation.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cell biology","disease gene discovery","intellectual disability","molecular genetics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453457,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["children and adults","learning and memory problems","molecular basis of inherited disease"],"scientific_title":"Investigating the role of the UPF3B gene and nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) process in mental retardation.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurogenetics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof Jozef Gecz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453457","simplified_title":"NMD in Intellectual Disability","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"572710.94","source_system":"Intellectual disability is a frequent and important medical problem. Genetic and environmental factors contribute about equally to the aetiology of intellectual disability. Estimated 1-3% of population suffer from a form of intellectual disability. Among the genetic factors contributing to intellectual disability are genes, and their mutations, on one of the human chromosomes, chromosome X. We have been studying human X-chromosome genes for many years and discovered in excess of 20 novel genes causing various forms of intellectual disability. Surprisingly the number of genes, in which mutations cause various forms of intellectual disability is unexpectedly high. Just on the human X-chromosome we expect in excess of 200 such genes, which is nearly 30% of the gene content of this chromosome. We propose to study a novel gene, UPF3B, we recently identified to be mutated in a form of intellectual disability. The normal function of this gene and its protein is known to a certain extent. The UPF3B protein plays a role of a guardian of other genes in human (and also other species) cells. The role of the UPF3B protein is to prevent erroneous genetic information to be used for the building of proteins with potentially toxic effects to the organism. In our patients this process clearly malfunctions as a consequence of the damaged UPF3B gene. We propose to shed some more light in to the molecular intricacies of this process with the aim to better understand the mechanics of the process. Families, which participate in our studies and have this gene involved will benefit from the availability of direct test. Multiple other families around the world are also likely to benefit, now or in the future."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Douglas Brooks","data":{"first_name":"Douglas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029621","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Brooks","source_individual_id":"5013616","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Douglas Brooks"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84673","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Thomas","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028363","middle_name":"Quinton","last_name":"Thomas","source_individual_id":"RMIS537861","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Thomas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84333","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jozef Gecz","data":{"first_name":"Jozef","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025021","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gecz","source_individual_id":"RMIS7756","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jozef Gecz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83435","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Charles Schwartz","data":{"first_name":"Charles","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010130","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schwartz","source_individual_id":"RMIS4560341","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Charles Schwartz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79448","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Daniel Geschwind","data":{"first_name":"Daniel","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001752","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Geschwind","source_individual_id":"RMIS4560338","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Daniel Geschwind"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77148","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61413","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Hypnosis Antenatal Training for Childbirth (HATCh): a randomised controlled trial","data":{"media_summary":"postnatal depression","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Analgesia","Childbirth","Hypnosis","Pregnancy","Self-hypnosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":453446,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Hypnosis","Pregnancy","childbirth","labour pain","postnatal depression"],"scientific_title":"Hypnosis Antenatal Training for Childbirth (HATCh): a randomised controlled trial","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Allan Cyna","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/453446","simplified_title":"Hypnosis Antenatal Training for Childbirth (HATCh): a randomised controlled trial","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"222754.58","source_system":"Pain and fear associated with childbirth is commonplace.

In addition self hypnosis may reduce a mother's anxiety and the chance of postnatal depression. This trial will take place in the largest tertiary maternity unit in South Australia. Women > 34 and < 39 weeks pregnant, who are planning a vaginal birth with one baby lying head first, are eligible to participate. Those women with previous experience of using hypnosis for childbirth; poor English requiring a translator; active severe depression or psychosis under the care of a psychiatrist; or pre-existing pain will be excluded. The women will be allocated by chance into one of three groups; Group 1 participants receive antenatal hypnosis training in preparation for childbirth administered by a qualified hypnotherapist with the use of an audio compact disc on hypnosis for re-enforcement; Group 2 women will receive antenatal hypnosis training in preparation for childbirth using an audio compact disc on hypnosis administered by a nurse with no training in hypnotherapy; Group 3 participants continue with their usual preparation for childbirth with no additional intervention. Women assigned to hypnosis groups commence hypnosis training as near as possible to 37 weeks pregnancy. We plan to recruit 150 women - group. This is the largest well designed trial investigating antenatal hypnosis group preparation for childbirth in late pregnancy. If effective, antenatal hypnosis training would be a simple, inexpensive way to improve the childbirth experience, reduce complications associated with drugs and yield cost savings in maternity care.

Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is the most common form of leukaemia in adults resulting from an accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood as a result of sustained, abnormal cell growth and survival together with a block in normal blood cell formation. There is still a major research effort aimed at understanding the mechanisms that lead to AML formation and it is clear that multiple AML oncogenes and tumour suppressors remain to be identified. Identification of further events involved in AML is important as it will provide avenues for more specific and less toxic treatments. These are needed because current success rates for AML remain relatively poor. It is critical that research into the understanding of the pathways and events involved in AML keeps pace with the rapid development of new approaches for therapeutic agents. Together this will greatly increase the scope for therapeutic intervention over the next decade. In this application we investigate the role of a new molecular pathway in AML. Our studies have identified a gene of particular interest that we propose normally prevents AML formation and therefore is frequently turned off by the cellular changes that lead to AML. We propose that silencing of this gene is particularly important in those AML cases which have mutations in the cell surface receptor FLT3 (about 30% of AML cases). We will use a number of molecular and cell biology approaches to manipulate this gene in mouse cell lines, normal mouse cells and human AML cells. A better understanding of the role of this gene and the associated pathway involving FLT3 may generate new leads for therapeutic approaches."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard D'Andrea","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018543","middle_name":"J","last_name":"D'Andrea","source_individual_id":"RMIS11290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard D'Andrea"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81748","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Gonda","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007535","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Gonda","source_individual_id":"5014863","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Gonda"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78737","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61410","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Fish Oil in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Fish Oil","Knee osteoarthritis","Randomised clinical trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":451900,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Aging","Disability","Knee osteoarthritis"],"scientific_title":"Fish Oil in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rheumatology and Arthritis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Catherine Hill","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/451900","simplified_title":"Fish oil in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"702725.39","source_system":"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects about 30% of Australians over the age of 65, but also at younger ages. It causes joint pain and stiffness, especially on exercise. The cause is unknown but it results in loss of joint cartilage. There are few treatments available to stop the progression, which can finally result in need for an artificial joint. Most treatments such as paracetamol and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce pain but have no effect on cartilage. NSAIDs can have serious side effects such as stomach ulcers and increased cardiovascular events (such as heart attacks). Fish oil has possible benefits in OA as it decreases pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA, another type of arthritis with joint inflammation and swelling), less use of NSAID in patients with RA, and in laboratory experiments may reduce cartilage breakdown in OA. It is likely that fish oil will have few side effects and decrease blood cholesterol. Many people with OA are already taking fish oil, however, there is no studies to know if it is effective in OA. The aim of this proposal is to study the effect of fish oil on pain and progression of knee OA, by doing a randomised clinical trial. Participants with knee OA will be given either high dose fish oil or similar oil with low levels of fish oil. The study will run for 2 years and during that time, we will measure pain and blood levels of fatty acids (part of the fish oil) and cholesterol. At the beginning and end of the study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee, a knee xray, and bone density testing will be done. The outcomes of the study will be to determine if fish oil affects pain and function (measured by questionnaires) and progression of OA (measured by cartilage changes on MRI).

On the other hand, therapies that target the survival of malignant cells would be expected to pull the rug from underneath cancer by killing the malignant cells regardless of whether they are growing or not. We have identified a signalling device in normal blood cells that controls both the growth and survival of cells. This device is in effect a switch with 2 components both of which are normally turned on and off. These 2 components are differentially wired to to the cell transmitting unique signals.

This may be due to changes in our environment or diet. Over this period of time there has also been an increase in the dietary intake of n-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils and a corresponding decline in the intake of n-3 fatty acids from fish. Studies now indicate that there is a plausible link between these dietary changes and allergic diseases. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that the potential benefits of increasing n-3 fatty acids may be greatest during pregnancy and before allergic responses are established. Our project aims to minimise allergies in children from families where at least one parent has an allergy. We will assess whether dietary n-3 fatty acid supplementation of pregnant women will result in fewer children with allergies at 1 and 3 years of age. If the proposed intervention is successful, it would be a safe, cheap, acceptable and effective strategy to prevent allergies in children at high risk."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Susan Prescott","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044912","middle_name":"L.","last_name":"Prescott","source_individual_id":"5012270","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Susan Prescott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88624","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Maria Makrides","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032291","middle_name":"","last_name":"Makrides","source_individual_id":"5011980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Maria Makrides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Gold","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019247","middle_name":"Steven","last_name":"Gold","source_individual_id":"5014876","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Gold"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81908","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Gibson","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Joanna Hawkes","data":{"first_name":"Joanna","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013576","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Hawkes","source_individual_id":"5015120","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Joanna Hawkes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80360","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Heddy Zola","data":{"first_name":"Heddy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011337","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zola","source_individual_id":"5011635","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Heddy Zola"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79783","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60334","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells in Common Marmoset Renal Transplantation","data":{"media_summary":"transplantation tolerance","end_year":2007,"keywords":["dendritic cell","immunological tolerance","renal failure","transplantation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399374,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["dendritic cell","immune regulation","immunological intervention","renal transplantation","transplantation tolerance"],"scientific_title":"Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells in Common Marmoset Renal Transplantation","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nephrology and Urology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Patrick Coates","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399374","simplified_title":"Tolerogenic DC in Renal Transplantation","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"162756.6","source_system":"ORGAN TRANSPLANT PATIENTS currently need life-long immune suppressing drugs to prevent rejection, often using 15 medications a day, costing Australia $52M in 2002. These drugs increase risks of infection and cancer. 90% of patients develop some form of cancer over 30 years. They also cause non-specific side effects including high blood pressure, diabetes and osteoporosis. The average lifespan of a kidney transplant is 8-15 years. Major causes of kidney transplant loss are rejection and drug toxicity. TRANSPLANTS ARE REJECTED when a recipient's immune system sees the kidney as foreign. Immune suppressing drugs prevent rejection by stopping the reaction to foreign tissues, but this causes increased infection and cancer risk. IMMUNE TOLERANCE means the recipient's immune system sees a transplant not as foreign but as part of itself, no longer reacting to it. If tolerance could be achieved for transplants, patients wouldn't need to use immune suppressing drugs. Costs of immune suppression would be nil. Tolerance is the best long-term solution for patients needing transplants. Tolerance has been achieved in various ways in mice models. DENDRITIC CELLS can be used to induce tolerance as they can silence a recipient's immune system, preventing it from seeing transplant tissues as foreign. We have shown in mice that a single infusion of a certain type of dendritic cells caused prolonged transplant tolerance without needing immune suppression. This project aims to use dendritic cells to induce tolerance in a marmoset model - a required step before allowing this therapy to be done in humans. PRIMATES like MARMOSETS have close genetic identity to humans and are ideal transplant models as their immune systems react much more like humans than other animals. Marmosets are not an endangered species and are smaller, cheaper and easier to care for than other primates. Ultimately, experiments in other species would need repeating in primates before human trials could be done."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Patrick Coates","data":{"first_name":"Patrick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035930","middle_name":"Toby","last_name":"Coates","source_individual_id":"RMIS706079","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Patrick Coates"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86312","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60333","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effects of lead and socio-cultural factors on cognition and behaviour of children in Port Pirie and Broken Hill","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["children","effects of lead on children's cognition and behaviour","emotional and behavioural problems","epidemiology","intelligence"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399358,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["environmental lead exposure","lead and behaviour","lead and child development","lead and cognition"],"scientific_title":"Effects of lead and socio-cultural factors on cognition and behaviour of children in Port Pirie and Broken Hill","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399358","simplified_title":"Lead, intelligence, and behavioural problems in children","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"394825.2","source_system":"The effect of lead on children's 'intelligence' is controversial. Poorer IQ scores in children with higher exposure to lead, have been found reasonably consistently, - but there is disagreement on whether lead exposure is simply a common ASSOCIATE of poor IQ, or whether it actually CAUSES deficits. In 1994, the NHMRC prudently recommended a graded series of interventions to be implemented, depending on the proprtion of children in the community with blood lead concentrations in specific categories above 10 ug lead -100 ml of blood. The choice of this figure (10 ug-dl) was more pragmatic than scientific; there being very little data on the health effects of exposures below 10 ug-dl available at that time. A recent analysis of pooled data from past studies has now suggested there may be very large effects on child IQ at blood lead concentration BELOW 10 ug-dl. Health authorities will soon be lobbied intensely to spend vast sums on new lead abatement programs. Cities like Port Pirie and Broken Hill (where cooperative programs have achieved such significant reductions in lead exposure that a high percentage of their children now have blood lead levels below 10 ug-dl), will be forced to examine expensive options to avoid closure of the industries which provide their economic backbones, if this analysis proves to be correct. Our proposal argues that before committing to new and costly abatement programs, there is an urgent need to augment our evidence-base by conducting a new study ofchildren with lead exposures below 10 ug-dl, using more modern measures of intelligence. The study will pay closer attention to some of the socio-cultural and inherited determinants of child IQ which may have confounded the lead-IQ association in past studies, and will supplement IQ assessments (which are now considered to derive from a very old and narrow view of intelligence) with new tools for measuring 'intelligence' that may be less socio-culturally dependent."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Sawyer","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045279","middle_name":"Gifford","last_name":"Sawyer","source_individual_id":"RMIS26114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Sawyer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88717","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Theodore Nettelbeck","data":{"first_name":"Theodore","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038751","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Nettelbeck","source_individual_id":"5016655","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Theodore Nettelbeck"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87037","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicholas Burns","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000654","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Burns","source_individual_id":"5013707","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Nicholas Burns"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76837","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000187","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Baghurst","source_individual_id":"5013272","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76706","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60332","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Canine adenovirus-mediated gene therapy for CNS pathology in LSD","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Sanfilippo syndrome","animal model","gene therapy","lysosomal storage disorders","treatment of central nervous system pathology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399355,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["incurable, progressive, neurological disease","inherited metabolic disorders","treatment of lysosomal storage disorders"],"scientific_title":"Canine adenovirus-mediated gene therapy for CNS pathology in LSD","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Genetics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof John Hopwood","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399355","simplified_title":"Gene therapy to treat progressive brain disease in children","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"490029.35","source_system":"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are inherited diseases that affect about 1 in 7700 Australian children; all share common physical symptoms include heart and breathing difficulties, stiff joints, skeletal deformities, enlarged head, and a characteristic facial appearance.

They have pleiotropic effects and usually result in premature death. Although intravenous enzyme replacement therapy has been developed for a number of these disorders, this approach to therapy is invasive, very expensive, of limited efficacy, and is completely ineffective in treating brain pathology. The principal reason for this is the protected nature of the brain which prevents enzymes that are administered intravenously from entering. Therefore, alternative therapies must be considered in order to provide more effective therapy for the mucopolysaccharidoses, especially those that have significant brain pathology. Gene therapy is one such alternative therapy but this still faces the problem of introducing the therapeutic agent (in this case the gene encoding the requisite enzyme) into the brain. This project aims to provide a comparitive evaluation of two gene therapy vectors for their efficacy in treating all aspects of the pathology found in the mucopolysaccharidoses. Both vectors have the properties of being able to efficiently deliver genes to different cell types and result in the stable genetic modification of the target cell, making them ideal for long-term treatment.

At present there are few treatments which have any benefits for these patients and many must undergo lung or heart-lung transplantation. This project is desigened both to find out new information about the disease process that affects the lung blood vessels and to offer a strategy for new treatments. The project will use a crippled form of the cold virus to deliver genes to the lining of the lung blood vessels, then see what impact that has on the pressure within the vessels and the ways in which they respond to certain stresses. These studies will be carried out using laboratory animals.

The effects are consistent and quite strong and appear to be unrelated to blood cholesterol levels. The effects are more likely due to the possibility that fish oil, which contains n-3 fats, can suppress abnormal heart rhythms which can cause 'sudden cardiac death'. This has been shown in animal studies, and recently we have shown that they can also suppress abnormal heart rhythms in humans. Patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery are particularly susceptible to abnormal heart rhythms in the upper chambers of the heart in the days immediately following surgery. While these abnormal rhythms are rarely life threatening, they can result in increased post-surgical complications and a longer hospital stay with associated increased costs to the health system. In this study we will determine whether providing high dose fish oil for 3 weeks immediately preceding coronary bypass surgery, will result in a reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing post-surgical abnormal heart rhythms. We will also examine the effects of n-3 fats on the incidence of other complications following bypass surgery and also the length of hospital stay. In addition, we will gather data which will provide insight into the mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids produce their well documented benefits to patients with cardiovascular disease. The significance of this study is its ability to provide a protective strategy in heart disease in which the mechanism is understood, which is effective, and importantly, which will have the potential to provide savings to the health care system through a reduction in hospital stay."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael James","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031542","middle_name":"John","last_name":"James","source_individual_id":"RMIS5607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael James"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85164","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Prashanthan Sanders","data":{"first_name":"Prashanthan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027780","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","source_individual_id":"5011557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Prashanthan Sanders"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84171","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr James Edwards","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024672","middle_name":"Robert Murray","last_name":"Edwards","source_individual_id":"RMIS3020502","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr James Edwards"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83335","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Glenn Young","data":{"first_name":"Glenn","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023165","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Young","source_individual_id":"5018545","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Glenn Young"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82965","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Robert Metcalf","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020862","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Metcalf","source_individual_id":"RMIS2307329","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Robert Metcalf"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82339","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Gibson","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60326","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"How does inflammation of the gut change its sensory innervation?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Inflammation","Nerve-Gut Interactions","Sensory Neurons","Visceral Sensations"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399324,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Inflammatory Bowel Disease","Inflammatory Pain","Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Visceral Sensation"],"scientific_title":"How does inflammation of the gut change its sensory innervation?","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ashley Blackshaw","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399324","simplified_title":"Effects of inflammation on sensory pathways from the gut","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"613767.61","source_system":"A large number of patients that are referred to gastroenterologists for pain and discomfort from the bowel are offered no effective treatment. This has a large impact on quality of life and often involves invasive tests to rule out inflammatory or cancerous causes. These patients are classified as suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients who have diagnosable inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) where colonoscopy is positive may suffer similar symptoms but also have no treatment for this type of symptom. It is becoming apparent that a large subgroup of IBS patients have undergone prior infection or inflammation, and that there are in fact changes in the types of cells in biopsies from their gut. Thus there are common features to IBS and inflammation. These may provide a means for us to find new treatments for IBS and IBD symptoms. Mice develop similar microscopic changes in the colon after experimental inflammation to those seen in humans, so we can discover more from this model. We have recently established that there are several types of sensory nerve fibres from the mouse colon and rectum that convey information about contractions, distension and chemical mediators released from tissue to the central nervous system. These are almost certainly responsible for generating symptoms in patients. We aim in this project to discover how these sensory nerves change in their responsiveness to mechanical and chemical stimuli in experimental inflammation. Importantly we shall investigate the mediators that are present in the tissue which may activate sensory nerves and-or the receptors on sensory nerves that may be increased. These experiments we hope will provide a target at which to aim novel drug treatments for symptoms of IBS and IBD."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ashley Blackshaw","data":{"first_name":"Ashley","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029484","middle_name":"Laurence","last_name":"Blackshaw","source_individual_id":"5013485","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ashley Blackshaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84644","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Stuart Brierley","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023778","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Brierley","source_individual_id":"5013610","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Stuart Brierley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83109","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Amanda Page","data":{"first_name":"Amanda","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009504","middle_name":"Jayne","last_name":"Page","source_individual_id":"RMIS173004","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Amanda Page"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79283","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Simon Brookes","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006250","middle_name":"Jh","last_name":"Brookes","source_individual_id":"RMIS222558","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Simon Brookes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78401","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60325","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Intrinsic bone qualities in fragility fracture patients: mass, microarchitecture, mineralization and damage accumulation","data":{"media_summary":"Osteoporosis","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Bone","Bone Turnover","Fatigue Microdamage","Histomorphometry","Trabecular Bone"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399305,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Age Related Skeletal Disorders","Bone Loss","Fragility Fracture","Osteoarthritis","Osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Intrinsic bone qualities in fragility fracture patients: mass, microarchitecture, mineralization and damage accumulation","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399305","simplified_title":"Bone quality in fragility fracture patients","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"447027.01","source_system":"Osteoporosis drug therapies have been associated with a significant reduction in fragility fracture. Patients receiving osteoporosis drugs, which have different effects on BMD, may have similar reductions in fractures. Furthermore, patients with fragility fractures may have abnormalities in bone structural and material properties. Changes to the process of bone renewal, due to drug therapy, may explain why fracture risk decreases where no detectable change to the structure of bone has been detected. It has also been shown that when bone renewal is suppressed microdamage accumulates in bone tissue, leading to reduced bone toughness. The toughness of bone is of primary importance in relation to fragility fractures, and it has been shown that the fatigue strength and fracture toughness (work to fracture) reduce considerably with age. This proposed study would seek to elucidate the role of bone tissue-level properties in determining bone quality for human subjects: patients with fragility hip fractures on no osteoporosis drugs therapy, hip fracture patients on osteoporosis drugs therapies, and normal age- and sex-matched individuals. Our laboratory has extensive experience in the analysis of the structure of human bone tissue. Recently, we have developed novel and unique techniques to assess bone quality, using micro-CT, backscatter SEM imaging, confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. This multifaceted study will identify at the bone tissue-level the structural mechanisms (micro-architecture, mineralisation, and microscopic cracking) that are indicative of the efficacy of fragility fracture drugs. Better understanding of the mechanisms by which bones are less likely to fracture will enable better targeting of osteoporosis drug therapy to individuals at risk of fragility fracture."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Julia Kuliwaba","data":{"first_name":"Julia","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014287","middle_name":"Suzanne","last_name":"Kuliwaba","source_individual_id":"5015797","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Julia Kuliwaba"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80557","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari","data":{"first_name":"Nicola (Nick)","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007214","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Fazzalari","source_individual_id":"RMIS5831069","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78651","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60324","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Transcriptional control of programmed cell death","data":{"media_summary":"steroid hormone action","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Drosophila","caspases","cell death/apoptosis","control of gene expression","steroid hormones"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399303,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["cancer cell biology","developmental disorders","gene expression","hormone-dependent cancer","steroid hormone action"],"scientific_title":"Transcriptional control of programmed cell death","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399303","simplified_title":"How gene expression controls cell survival and cell death?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"509267.61","source_system":"Programmed cell death (PCD), also known as apoptosis, plays a fundamental role in cell and tissue homeostasis and its misregulation is implicated in many human diseases.

As hormones, in particular the steroid hormones, are directly linked to the pathogenesis of many forms of cancer, including breast, prostate and ovarian cancer, some of the most common malignancies afflicting the society, it is important to study the mechanism of hormonal control of apoptosis in order to identify components of the regulatory apparatus. Identification of precise factors that regulate PCD will not only provide basic understanding of hormone-controlled PCD, but any novel factors involved in the control of cellular levels of death activators or death inhibitors are potential targets for anticancer drug development. This proposal is based on our ongoing studies, which combine the powerful biochemical and cellular approaches with the in vivo studies in vinegar fly (Drosophila) to address complex issues that are often difficult to pursue by the direct use of mammalian systems.

Extensive apoptosis occurs during foetal development which is required to get rid of many excess cells produced during the growth of the embryo. Selective apoptosis is also essential for the formation of different tissues and organs in developing foetus. In the adult, apoptosis is required for proper functioning of the immune system, to remove virus infected and cancer cells and, in general, to maintain the correct number of cells in the body. As such, misregulation of apoptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of a wide array of diseases. To understand, manage and treat disorders that result from aberrant apoptosis, we need to know at molecular and cellular level, how apoptosis is brought about and how it is regulated. We have been studying these processes in detail for several years. Central to the apoptotic execution of cell death are a group of proteases called caspases, that target many cellular proteins for specific cleavage. The activation of caspases is the crucial step in the initiation of apoptosis and therefore each cell has developed complex ways to control this process. If we understand how these regulatory mechanisms operate, we can then formulate strategies that are targeted towards pathologies involving abnormal apoptosis. In this proposal we will use vinegar fly as a model to study the function of caspases in development. We believe that results from this proposal will have several major benefits. Firstly, they will provide important insight into the mechanisms of developmental apoptosis thereby filling many gaps in our current knowledge. Secondly, the study will endeavour to identify new molecules-pathways that lead to caspase activation.

This liver disease is primarily a result of the host immune response to liver cells (hepatocytes) infected with HCV. As part of this immune response there in an increase in the number of immune cells that infiltrate the liver. To date we do not fully understand the mechanims that attract these cells to the liver but a class of molecules called chemokines is the most likely candidate. Thus a greater understanding of the chemokines expressed in the liver, their modulation and role in attracting immune cells to the liver in HCV-related liver disease will help us understand the basic mechanisms of liver disease with the possibility of development of novel therapeutic strategies. In pilot studies we have shown that the chemokine interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC) is significantly increased in the liver of persons infected with HCV. I-TAC is a member of the CXCR3 ligand chemokine family that attracts lymphocytes to sites of inflammation and as such may play an important role in hepatitis C. We have also shown that hepatocytes express I-TAC and that HCV can upregulate expression of I-TAC in a laboratory model of HCV replication. This proposal plans to determine the molecular mechanisms of I-TAC expression in response to HCV replication and to investigate if I-TAC expression is unique for hepatits C or a general feature of viral infections of the liver. We also plan to determine the the role of I-TAC and other CXCR3 ligand family members in a mouse model of viral hepatitis through the use of CXCR3 ligand antagonists. These experiments will enhance or knowledge of the role of the CXCR3 ligands in hepatitis C and viral hepatitis in general."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ming Qiao","data":{"first_name":"Ming","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044952","middle_name":"","last_name":"Qiao","source_individual_id":"RMIS3159697","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ming Qiao"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88639","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Beard","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029360","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Beard","source_individual_id":"RMIS1033698","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Beard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84611","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Shaun Mccoll","data":{"first_name":"Shaun","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020717","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Mccoll","source_individual_id":"RMIS15917","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Shaun Mccoll"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82300","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60318","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of Cyp2e1, alcohol and HCV in modulation of hepatocyte homeostasis HCV replication and resistance to interferon","data":{"media_summary":"viral replication","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Cyp2e1","Hepatic Stellate Cells","Hepatitis C virus replication","alcoholand oxidative stress","anti-viral action of interferon"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399284,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["alcoholic liver disease","gene expression","hepatic fibrosis","viral hepatitis","viral replication"],"scientific_title":"The role of Cyp2e1, alcohol and HCV in modulation of hepatocyte homeostasis HCV replication and resistance to interferon","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology and Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr MICHAEL BEARD","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399284","simplified_title":"The role of alcohol, Cyp2e1 and hepatitis C virus in liver cell biology","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"455520.54","source_system":"Liver disease caused by alcohol consumption and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are major national health problems. Liver disease caused by HCV is greatly accelerated by alcohol consumption, however, the connection between the biochemical events initiated by alcohol, HCV and inflammatory pathways resulting in liver disease are not well understood. Preliminary studies have identified a link between an important alcohol-metabolising enzyme, Cyp2e1, HCV replication, oxidative stress and a powerful mediator of liver injury called tumour necrosis factor alpha. Furthermore we have shown that alcohol metabolism by Cyp2e1 results in an increase in HCV replication and negatively impacts on the anti-viral action of interferon. The studies contained within this proposal aim to build on these exciting new insights by attempting to identify new mediators and mechanisms of liver disease as a consequence of Cyp2e1 expression, alcohol and HCV replication. We will also examine the molecular mechanisms by which alcohol potentiates HCV replication.

Insulin-like growth factors-I and -II act via cell surface receptors (IGF-1R). Much effort has been applied to blocking the action of insulin-like growth factors via IGF-1R. However, recently a second mechanism has been identified by which the insulin-like growth factors are involved in cancer. Insulin-like growth factor-II can also promote cancer growth and survival via an alternative form of the insulin receptor. We will join with our international collaborator to bring together a team of biochemists and protein structural biologists who are world leaders in understanding protein interactions in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor systems. As relatively little is known about this alternate pathway we propose to define the mechanism of binding of insulin-like growth factor-II to the alternate insulin receptor isoform. Using a combination of well-established and novel techniques we will map the interaction.

Disturbingly, the incidence of revision hip surgery in Australia is now more than 15%, meaning that, despite the impressive success of joint replacement surgery, a significant number of arthroplasties fail. It is becoming more common for young, active individuals to receive joint replacement surgery to improve their quality of life. This, combined with increasing life expectancy, and the known higher rate of failure of joint replacements in younger patients, means that the morbidity of a failed replacement, and the mobidity and associated mortality of revision surgery, will become an increasingly important health issue, with a major impact upon health budgets. The overwhelming majority of hip and knee prostheses have metal or ceramic on polyethylene bearing surfaces. It is now apparent that most implants fail due to bone loss around them leading to loosening, and evidence is accumulating that polyethylene wear particles are a major contributing factor to this process. It is therefore vital that we obtain better understanding of the causes of implant failure in order to extend the life of these implants and this project is designed to do so."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Donald Howie","data":{"first_name":"Donald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037378","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Howie","source_individual_id":"RMIS18497","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Donald Howie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86682","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Tania Crotti","data":{"first_name":"Tania","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0036088","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Crotti","source_individual_id":"RMIS705909","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Tania Crotti"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86353","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins","data":{"first_name":"Gerald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005872","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Atkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS228986","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78304","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Haynes","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002107","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Haynes","source_individual_id":"RMIS18488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Haynes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77248","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60309","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Studies on the role of the p101 component of the Class 1B PI 3-Kinase in cell migration and activation.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Activation","Lymphocyte","PI 3 kinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399161,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["CTL","Cell migration","Immunity"],"scientific_title":"Studies on the role of the p101 component of the Class 1B PI 3-Kinase in cell migration and activation.","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Shaun McColl","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399161","simplified_title":"p101 and lymphocyte migratioctivation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"457267.61","source_system":"This research will determine the biological role of a protein of unknown function that is likely to participate in movement of white blood cells through the body.

Furthermore, most authorities predict that the need for informal care will grow as the population ages and as government policies continue to emphasize de-institutionalisation and care in the community. A significant group of these informal caregivers are mothers caring for children with chronic disabilities. These mothers have long been known to have higher rates of psychosocial problems than other mothers. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these problems arise. This is a significant omission, as the potential benefit of home-based care for children with chronic disabilities will only be realised if caregivers remain healthy. It seems unlikely that caregivers will be able to provide effective care for children if their own health has been compromised by the demands of caring for the children's disabilities. The present study will provide new information about the relationship between the caregiving time mothers must spend caring for children with chronic disability, and maternal psychological adjustment and health-related quality of life. A better understanding of the mechanisms which give rise to maternal psychosocial problems in this population is important for two reasons. First, information in this area is an essential prerequisite for the development of effective support to reduce the problems experienced by primary caregivers and ensure they can play an effective ongoing role in the care of children with chronic disability. Second, at a theoretical level there is a great need to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which environmental stressors give rise to mental health problems, particularly depression, in the general population."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Sawyer","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045279","middle_name":"Gifford","last_name":"Sawyer","source_individual_id":"RMIS26114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Sawyer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88717","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Bittman","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035404","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Bittman","source_individual_id":"RMIS3062891","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Bittman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86174","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Annette La Greca","data":{"first_name":"Annette","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008493","middle_name":"M","last_name":"La Greca","source_individual_id":"RMIS3867330","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Annette La Greca"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78998","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000187","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Baghurst","source_individual_id":"5013272","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76706","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60306","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The beyondblue schools research initiative: A two-year follow-up.","data":{"media_summary":"Risk factors for depression","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Adolescents","Depression","Mental health","School-Based Intervention"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399149,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Adolescents","Depression","Prevention","Risk factors for adolescent health","Risk factors for depression"],"scientific_title":"The beyondblue schools research initiative: A two-year follow-up.","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Sawyer","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399149","simplified_title":"The beyondblue schools research initiative: A two-year follow-up.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"827285.23","source_system":"The prevalence of Depressive Disorders among children and adolescents was estimated in the Australian National Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey to be 3.7%.

These findings emphasise the importance of finding alternative approaches to help the large number of young people with depression who do not receive help from professional services. This application seeks funding to evaluate the beyondblue Schools Research Initiative. The key features of the initiative are the development of a strong partnership between the health and education sectors and a focus on both individual-level and school-level risk factors. This has enabled us to provide a much longer duration of intervention than previous studies, to test the intervention in several different Australian States, and to utilise a broadly based intervention that includes a range of approaches, each of which have the potential to help reduce adolescent depression. The significance of the project lies in its potential to identify effective interventions which can reduce rates of depression experienced by adolescents, and the quality of the ongoing research partnership we have established across the education and health sectors.

Currently there is little information as to how the human oocyte and embryo develops. This study will address the current lack of knowledge by extending the information gathered in animal models to establish how the human oocyte communicates with its surrounding cells and how this communication is important for development. We will also study how the developing embryo maintains its physiology and metabolism and the relationship between the ability to control metabolic balance and viability will be established. All of the questions outlined in this proposal can be performed without disturbing the oocyte and developing embryo by analysing the surrounding cells and the spent media. Therefore, all of these questions can be answered non-invasively. The outcome of this proposal will be an increased understanding of how the physiology and development of the human oocyte and embryo is maintained. However, importantly this data will then provide information as to the relationship of these parameters to developmental competence. Therefore, it will be possible to establish a range of markers that can be used to predict the developmental competence of a human embryo. Currently multiple embryos are routinely transferred in an IVF cycle resulting in an increase in multiple gestation pregnancies and their associated complications. The information generated in this study will provide information enabling markers to be used to identify the most viable embryo from a cohort, which is essential if single embryo transfer is to be universally adopted in an IVF program."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Darryl Russell","data":{"first_name":"Darryl","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033549","middle_name":"Lyndon","last_name":"Russell","source_individual_id":"5017313","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Darryl Russell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85684","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Davies","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030274","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Davies","source_individual_id":"RMIS62012","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Davies"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84850","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michelle Lane","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026134","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lane","source_individual_id":"RMIS2282530","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michelle Lane"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83760","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60303","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"How does disruption of circadian rhythms induce diabetes?","data":{"media_summary":"sleep deprivation","end_year":2008,"keywords":["circadian rhythm","gene knockout","gene regulation","glucose metabolism","insulin resistance"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399131,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Type 2 diabetes","cardiovascular risk factors","environmental health","glucose homeostasis","sleep deprivation"],"scientific_title":"How does disruption of circadian rhythms induce diabetes?","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr David Kennaway","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399131","simplified_title":"How does disruption of circadian rhythms induce diabetes?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"631782.28","source_system":"Increasing evidence suggests that disturbed circadian rhythms initiate and amplify metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The increasing and already high proportion of workers engaged in shiftwork, and increased frequency of disruption of these rhythms in the population more generally, implicate this body system as contributing to the growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes and related disorders in our community and world-wide. While we are now beginning to understand how our rhythms are synchronised to night and day, how this rhythmicity is linked to our organs in the normal and common disease states such as diabetes is poorly understood. The discovery of a special set of genes, called clock genes that function in all of the cells in our bodies and strongly influence the function of our organs such as the liver, pancreas and heart has been particularly important. We hypothesise that both environmentally (exogenous) and genetically (endogenous) induced disruption of circadian rhythms causes metabolic dysfunction. This is due to altered central and peripheral clock gene expression rhythms, which in turn alter metabolic rhythms and impair glucose homeostasis.

The study is important, as older people are more likely to access the general practitioner than a specialist for respiratory problems. Spirometry in general practice is not common and is of variable quality. The most common approach to diagnosis by the general practitioner is a diagnostic trial of medication to provide evidence of asthma. This can be broken down into four elements of: entry criteria to a therapeutic trial; choice of drug in a therapeutic trial; length of time for a therapeutic trial, and; assessment criteria in a therapeutic trial. No evidence-based guidelines are available to assist the general practitioner in each of these stages making the therapeutic trial a safety and effectiveness issue of major importance, especially in the older person. The purpose of the study proposed is to conduct a randomised controlled trial in a representative population sample of older people to determine the evidence-based components of a diagnostic therapeutic trial for the guidance of general practitioners. The study will also assess which diagnostic questions and medical tests provide greatest assistance to the general practitioner in diagnosing asthma in the older person."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Renuka Visvanathan","data":{"first_name":"Renuka","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028599","middle_name":"","last_name":"Visvanathan","source_individual_id":"5018112","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Renuka Visvanathan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84405","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Beltrame","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017678","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Beltrame","source_individual_id":"5013436","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Beltrame"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81517","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Adams","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005726","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Adams","source_individual_id":"5013104","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Adams"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78264","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David.H.

In healthy individuals this prevents the immune system from attacking the cells and tissues of the body, food proteins, and the beneficial bacteria of the gut. However in autoimmune disease the system becomes imbalanced, allowing reactions to benign antigens, causing diseases such as diabetes, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. One of the key players in the maintenance of a healthy immune system is a specialized set of T cells known as T Regulatory cells. These cells are rare, at 1-4% of all T cells, yet are potent modulators of other T cells, and can prevent the activation of a T cell if it is reacting to a self-antigen. If they can control the cause of autoimmune disease, and patient Treg cells can be manipulated, it may be possible to use them therapeutically. Recently the switch that is required to generate regulatory cells was identified from patients with a rare autoimmune disease called Immunodysregulation, polyendocrynopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome or IPEX. A mouse disease, Scurfy, with similar symptoms, is caused by the same mutations. The mutated gene encodes a protein, FoxP3, and this protein is able to bind to other genes in T cells and regulate their function. Without this protein, there are no T regulatory cells, resulting in autoimmune disorders. At this time there is very little known about how the FoxP3 gene is able to make a T cell become a regulatory T cell, and nothing is known about the genes that are turned off and on to facilitate this. If we can understand better the role of this protein, FoxP3, in the generation and maintenance of T cells with regulatory function, we may better be able to diagnose and treat autoimmune diseases, and this knowledge will have broad application to many autoimmune disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Frances Shannon","data":{"first_name":"Frances","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022055","middle_name":"","last_name":"Shannon","source_individual_id":"5017453","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Frances Shannon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82684","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard D'Andrea","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018543","middle_name":"J","last_name":"D'Andrea","source_individual_id":"RMIS11290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard D'Andrea"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81748","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Simon Barry","data":{"first_name":"Simon","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011646","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Barry","source_individual_id":"5013363","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Simon Barry"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79861","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Heddy Zola","data":{"first_name":"Heddy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011337","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zola","source_individual_id":"5011635","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Heddy Zola"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79783","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60300","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Substance P antagonists as a novel therapeutic intervention in stroke","data":{"media_summary":"transient ischaemic attack","end_year":2008,"keywords":["brain ischaemia","neurogenic inflammation","neuroprotection","oedema","stroke"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399121,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["brain damage","central nervous system injury","oedema","stroke","transient ischaemic attack"],"scientific_title":"Substance P antagonists as a novel therapeutic intervention in stroke","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Robert Vink","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399121","simplified_title":"Substance P antagonists in stroke","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"318267.61","source_system":"Stroke is the major cause of disability in adults over 45 years of age in Australia. The economic and social cost of stroke is enormous with billions of dollars spent each year on the management and rehabilitation of stroke patients. Despite the enormity of this public health problem, no effective treatment currently exists. A number of studies have now demonstrated that much of the morbidity following stroke is associated with the breakdown of the blood brain barrier, development of oedema, and subsequent brain damage in areas surrounding the central region of the stroke. These events develop over hours to days following the stroke and are known as secondary injury. This delayed progression of injury suggests that appropriate pharmacologic intervention can prevent, or at least attenuate, this secondary injury process with a resultant improvement in outcome. Nonetheless, few interventions are available that can limit this development. Our own recent studies have demonstrated that regions in brains which demonstrate the presence of stroke also exhibit signs of neurogenic inflammation, which has been associated with oedema formation, oxidative damage and cell death in other tissues. Although a number of neuropeptides have been implicated in this process, it is thought that substance P release is closely associated with these pathophysiological processes. Thus, inhibiting substance P binding may offer a novel therapeutic approach to attenuating oedema formation and the development of neurologic deficits following stroke. This proposal will utilise a combined biochemical, pharmacologic and behavioural approach to characterize the role of neurogenic inflammation in the development of oedema and neurologic deficits following stroke. Moreover, we will develop a novel pharmacotherapy that can potentially be used in the treatment of clinical stroke."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Vink","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0046032","middle_name":"","last_name":"Vink","source_individual_id":"5018118","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Vink"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88913","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Blumbergs","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029507","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Blumbergs","source_individual_id":"RMIS11120","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Blumbergs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84647","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Faden","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001488","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Faden","source_individual_id":"RMIS996536","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alan Faden"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77077","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60299","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Stretch Induced Pulmonary Vein Remodelling: Implications for the Initiation and Maintenance of Atrial Fibrillation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Arrhythmia","Atrial Fibrillation","Electrophysiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399116,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Arrhythmias","Atrial Arrhythmias","Atrial Fibrillation","Congestive Heart Failure"],"scientific_title":"Stretch Induced Pulmonary Vein Remodelling: Implications for the Initiation and Maintenance of Atrial Fibrillation","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

It is a chaotic rhythm disorder of the top chambers of the heart that results in frequent hospitalization for falls, chest pain, palpitations, heart failure and stroke. In addition, it is associated with an increased mortality. Evidence suggests an important role of the pulmonary veins (PV; veins draining blood from the lungs back to the heart) in the initiation and maintenance of AF. However, why these structures promote AF remains unknown. Several conditions predisposing to the development of AF are associated with atrial stretch (such as heart failure). These conditions have documented abnormalities within the atria but the changes that occur within the PVs are unknown. It has even been suggested that pulsatile stretch, as caused by blood flow, in the appropriately predisposed patient, may be enough to trigger AF. As such there has been an intensive search to identify the abnormalities that occur within the PVs. In patients with AF, the PVs demonstrate distinctive electrophysiological properties compared to those without AF. However, the effect of stretch, a common predisposing factor, on the electrophysiological properties of the PV is not known. Preventing electrical activity from the PVs interacting with the heart by ablation has provided a glimpse at our ability to cure AF. However, further improvements in our procedural technique, the ability to prevent the occurrence of this rhythm disorder, and the development of noninvasive strategies to cure AF, hinges on the better understanding of the mechanisms initiating and maintaining this condition. In particular, the electrophysiological changes within the PVs that predispose patients to the development of AF need to be investigated. This series of studies will evaluate the effect of acute and chronic stretch on the PVs in humans to determine why these structures promote AF."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Prashanthan Sanders","data":{"first_name":"Prashanthan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027780","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sanders","source_individual_id":"5011557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Prashanthan Sanders"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84171","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60298","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Macrophage-regulated tissue remodelling in endometrial receptivity for embryo implantation and pregnancy success","data":{"media_summary":"placenta","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Cellular interactions","Immunology not elsewhere identified","Obstetrics and Gynaecology","Pregnancy","Reproduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399105,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["endometrium","endothelial cell","implantation","macrophage","placenta"],"scientific_title":"Macrophage-regulated tissue remodelling in endometrial receptivity for embryo implantation and pregnancy success","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Sarah Robertson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399105","simplified_title":"Macrophage regulation of embryo implantation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"456779.35","source_system":"Infertility and recurrent miscarriage affect 60-80 million couples globally, including 15% of couples in Australia.

We have discovered in mice that disruption in the populations of immune cells called macrophages within the uterine endometrial lining can reduce the receptivity of the endometrum to embryo implantation, and can lead to fetal growth retardation and impaired health after birth. The purpose of this project is to delineate the precise functions of macrophages in interacting with other cells in the endometrium to facilitate attachment of the embryo, its invasion into maternal tissues, and its access to an adequate blood supply as the placenta develops during early pregnancy. We will employ state of the art experimental strategies including genetic models to deplete endometrial macrophage populations in mice, and will then study the implications for changes in endometrial tissue structure and function. Furthermore we will investigate the long term consequences of early macrophage perturbations for the fetus and neonate after birth.

Underlying this diversity in cellular functions are a quorum of fundamental cellular responses that include cell survival, cell proliferation (growth) and cell differentiation (commitment to a more mature cell identity). Diffusible factors (called growth factors) are important in regulating these cellular responses. This is achieved through growth factor binding to specific proteins (called receptors) on the surface of cells which in turn activate signalling cascades that convey messages within the cell instructing a specific response. We have identified a new mechanism that allows a growth factor receptor to convert analogue inputs (in the form of growth factor stimulation) to a digital output (where a cell responds in a decisive fashion). This analogue-to-digital conversion is encoded by a molecular switch embedded in growth factor receptors that toggles between two alternate positions to promote either cell survival alone or cell survival as well as cell differentiation-proliferation. In this manner, these molecular switches have binary (either-or) characteristics and provide a new explanation for the independent regulation and coordination of different cell functions. These findings have implications for understanding how specific cellular responses such as cell survival, proliferation and differentiation can be regulated and perhaps harnessed to improve tissue regeneration after damage (e.g. in stroke, heart attack trauma) or in understanding how things go wrong in diseases such as cancer where cell survival, proliferation and differentiation become deregulated"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Mark Guthridge","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031058","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Guthridge","source_individual_id":"5015004","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Mark Guthridge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85046","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6931","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Modulation of T cell surface receptors that are dependent on extrinsic tyrosine kinases.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["CTLA-4","T cells","costimulation","receptor signalling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":375170,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Modulation of T cell surface receptors that are dependent on extrinsic tyrosine kinases.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Claire Jessup","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/375170","simplified_title":"Modulation of T cell surface receptors that are dependent on extrinsic tyrosine kinases.","sub_type":"CJ Martin Biomedical ECF","total_budget":"372009.5","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Claire Jessup","data":{"first_name":"Claire","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019913","middle_name":"Frances","last_name":"Jessup","source_individual_id":"5015522","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Claire Jessup"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82069","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6907","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Seminal plasma cytokines as novel fertility diagnostics in men","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["cytokine","infertility","male reproduction","pregnancy","sperm function testing"],"nhmrc_grant_id":399106,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Seminal plasma cytokines as novel fertility diagnostics in men","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Sarah Robertson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/399106","simplified_title":"Cytokine diagnostics in human semen","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"101000","source_system":"Infertility and recurrent miscarriage affect 60-80 million couples globally, including 15% of couples in Australia.

moment control the proper growth and maturation of an organism during development, and are responsible for the organism's homeostasis and proper response to environmental changes as an adult. Many gene expression programs are highly complex and controlled by regulating the activation of individual genes as they are copied from DNA to RNA. However, this activation is just the start of the process to produce an active protein. In higher organisms, these RNA copies almost always contain interruptions called introns, which must be excised from the RNA. Also, protein factors bound to specific RNAs can dictate whether the RNA is used to make protein or not, and these factors can also affect the localisation of the RNA to a specific sub-cellular destination, giving rise to highly localised protein expression. Evidence suggests that neurons are a cell type that rely heavily on mechanisms of RNA regulation. During development neurons become highly polarised, acquiring an axon which can elongate and find distant synaptic targets. While much is known about how axon growth cones respond to various guidance cues, the mechanisms by which the axon is able to translate this guidance cue information into structural changes which allow the growth cone to expand or collapse is largely unexplored. Recent evidence suggests that accurate growth cone guidance is absolutely dependent upon local protein synthesis. The functional corollary of this finding is that axon guidance requires RNA localisation and control of protein synthesis of RNAs in the growth cone. This phenomenon of spatial gene regulation within an individual cell is a central research interest for understanding how the brain functions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kirk Jensen","data":{"first_name":"Kirk","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019910","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Jensen","source_individual_id":"RMIS3092417","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Kirk Jensen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82068","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6196","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Oral Health Research for the Australian Population","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Child Health","Dental Health Surveys","Dental service Utilisation","Determinants of Oral Health","Oral epidemiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349537,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Oral Health Research for the Australian Population","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Gary Slade","higher_grant_type":"Capacity","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349537","simplified_title":"Oral Health Research for the Australian Population","sub_type":"Population Health Capacity Building Grant","total_budget":"2501265","source_system":"This program will build capacity and expertise in Australia s population health research workforce.

Projects will range from analysis of inflammation caused by periodontal (gum) disease in the Australian population, to evaluation of school dental services provided over the last 30 years. Team investigators will work on these surveys to tackle public health problems confronting four distinct dental generations of Australians: �1) people in the oldest tooth loss generation who have lost, on average, half of their natural teeth; 2) the amalgam generation of middle-aged adults who had unprecedented numbers of cavities that are now filled - treatment that requires extensive maintenance and repair; 3) the younger fluoride generation that has historically-low rates of dental decay; 4) and today s pre-schoolers among whom there is disturbing evidence that oral disease is becoming concentrated within the most disadvantaged segments of the population.

Although there have been several new treatments for heroin addiction, methadone maintenance remains the most effective way to minimize the harms associated with heroin addiction. The current research proposal seeks to test a new approach to setting of methadone dose, using monitoring of methadone blood levels, effects and side-effects in determining when to increase doses, and when to switch to alternative therapies. This provides an objective method of planning treatment that focuses on suppressing heroin use. The potential subjects of the study are the 50% of patients who continue to use heroin regularly during treatment. All will undergo assessment involving measurement of blood levels of methadone, testing of effects and side-effects of methadone, and monitoring of safety. Half will be randomly allocated to usual care, and half to therapeutic drug monitoring, with dose adjustments according to the results of testing. At 3 and 6 months all subjects will undergo repeat test sessions. It is hypothesized that those in the experimental group will be using less heroin (confirmed by hair testing). It is expected that the study will also identify a small group of subjects with genetically different opioid receptors, who will require very high doses of methadone to be stabilized. The study will allow a detailed analysis of how best to monitor dose adequacy; the relationship between withdrawal symptoms, methadone blood levels, and heroin use, and will provide the first clear investigation of the relationship between changes in methadone blood concentration and certain potentially dangerous changes in the electrical activity of the heart. The intended outcome of this research project is a model for a higher standard methadone program that is more effective in reducing the problems of heroin use in our community."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jason White","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022947","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"White","source_individual_id":"RMIS1018187","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jason White"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82913","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr James Bell","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0011731","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bell","source_individual_id":"RMIS5918","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr James Bell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79877","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Somogyi","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004750","middle_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Somogyi","source_individual_id":"RMIS7262","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Somogyi"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77990","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6194","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Upregulation of chemokine receptor expression and function on CD4+ T cells in primary and secondary immune responses","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Chemokine","Lymphocyte","Migration"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349533,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Immunity","Inflammation","Transplantation"],"scientific_title":"Upregulation of chemokine receptor expression and function on CD4+ T cells in primary and secondary immune responses","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Shaun McColl","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349533","simplified_title":"Chemokine receptors and lymphocyte migration","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"469500","source_system":"This research will begin to determine the significance of changes in the amount of recently-discovered proteins on the surface of cells called T lymphocytes.

Bacteria (germs) that stick to teeth in dental plaque are the primary cause of gum disease. However, the amount of damage caused to the gums depends heavily on the body's immune system which fights infection throughout the body. Like many other health conditions, gum disease occurs at a higher rate in people in a relatively low socioeconomic-position (SEP) compared to people from high SEP. Studies of other health conditions have shown that psychosocial stress (eg. job strain, financial stress) disproportionately affects people in low SEP groups. Stress, in turn, is known to alter the body's defense mechanisms, including the immune system, contributing to higher rates of conditions such as heart disease. Researchers have used the term allostatic load to describe this failure of the body's defense system under stress. Stress has also been suggested as a contributing factor in gum disease. This study will investigate whether this sequence of events producing allostatic load also plays a role in gum disease. We will study a random sample of 610 Australian adults from the full range of SEP backgrounds. We will ask them about their experience of daily stress, and measure their levels of gum disease and dental plaque. We will also collect samples of fluid from around their gums to measure quantities of two chemicals that indicate the activity of immune defense mechanisms in the gums. We will analyze these results to determine whether stress affects the body's responses to dental plaque, and whether that response accounts for differences in levels of gum disease between SEP groups. Results from this study will pinpoint the role of common bodily defense mechanisms in the development of gum disease. These results may help to identify sources of stress that, if controlled, could reduce rates of gum disease and other conditions affected by allostatic load."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Gary Slade","data":{"first_name":"Gary","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0045464","middle_name":"","last_name":"Slade","source_individual_id":"RMIS2290716","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Gary Slade"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88759","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anne Sanders","data":{"first_name":"Anne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016046","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Sanders","source_individual_id":"5017340","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Anne Sanders"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81045","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Bartold","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005985","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bartold","source_individual_id":"RMIS5803397","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Bartold"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78334","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6192","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Relaxin signalling in the endometrium and the regulation of early pregnancy","data":{"media_summary":"intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)","end_year":2007,"keywords":["G protein coupled receptors","embryo implantation","endometrial differentiation","pregnancy","relaxin"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349502,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cancer and related disorders","early pregnancy loss","endometriosis","infertility","intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)"],"scientific_title":"Relaxin signalling in the endometrium and the regulation of early pregnancy","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Richard Ivell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349502","simplified_title":"Relaxin supports female fertility","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"466125","source_system":"Relaxin is a hormone, that is made in the ovary and the uterus, and plays a very important role in supporting the growth and development of the uterus so that the young embryo can implant properly. In fact, early pregnancy loss is associated with altered levels of relaxin in the blood. Very little is known about how relaxin works in the uterus. This project aims to address this important function, and makes use of cultured uterine cells prepared from tissues taken from women undergoing hysterectomy for fibroids or similar illnesses. When these cells are grown in culture, we can mimic in vitro many of the events that occur in early pregnancy, causing the cells to differentiate and grow just as they would in vivo. Relaxin appears to exert its important effects on these cells by causing the concentration of the second messenger cAMP in the so-called stromal cells to increase greatly and in a sustained manner. It is this cAMP which is then responsible for many of the changes which are essential for healthy pregnancy. A knowledge of the molecular mechanisms behind these effects would help us firstly to understand how the uterus becomes receptive to an implanting embryo, and may explain why some women lose their babies in early pregnancy, or develop some of the negative symptoms associated with placental development such as growth restriction and preeclampsia. Relaxin appears to stimulate cells through the mediation of a new type of cell surface receptor, called LGR7. Whilst structurally this receptor looks like those for many other hormones, belonging to the group of so-called G-protein coupled receptors, it does not behave like these in natural uterine cells. Instead it appears to make use of completely new signaling pathways inside the cells. This project aims to unravel and understand these new pathways, thus providing information not only of importance for diagnosis and treatment of early pregnancy problems, but also of relevance for all other similar receptors."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Ivell","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037477","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ivell","source_individual_id":"RMIS1216074","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Ivell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86708","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6191","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of afferent input in the development of focal task specific dystonia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["afferent input","focal dystonia","motor cortex","plasticity","transcranial magnetic stimulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349498,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cortical reorganisation","dystonia","rehabilitation of motor function"],"scientific_title":"The role of afferent input in the development of focal task specific dystonia","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Michael Ridding","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349498","simplified_title":"Afferent input in focal dystonia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"213000","source_system":"The term dystonia is used to describe a condition that is characterised by abnormal muscle activation patterns.

Depending upon which part of the body is affected, dystonia may be classified as generalised (affecting two or more body segments), hemi (involving one side), segmental (involving adjacent body parts or a segment), or focal (affecting one part of the body). Many of the focal dystonias are also task specific and the aim of this proposal is to investigate these task-specific focal dystonias. Task-specific focal dystonia is common in the community and causes considerable suffering and loss of productivity. For example, writer's cramp (a common form of task specific focal dystonia) is probably the commonest cause of writing difficulty in patients in whom this is the sole complaint. No treatment regimen has been shown to be effective in alleviating it's often debilitating symptoms. The aim of these studies is to further define the pathophysiological changes seen in task-specific dystonia and investigate the mechanisms responsible for their generation. Using the techniques of transcranial magnetic stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation we will investigate the organisation of the motor cortex in this condition and examine the influence of afferent input on intrinsic cortical circuitry. We hypothesise that the motor regions of the brain are more sensitive to the particular repeated patterns of sensory information reaching the brain during repetitive movement and this results in abnormal alterations in organisation that may be responsible for the symptoms of dystonia.

Not only do Australian adults have comparatively poor oral health in the lead-up to midlife, but also socioeconomic inequalities in dental decay are more pronounced at this stage of life than at any other stage before or after. This study proposes to look at how oral health in young adults in shaped by their experiences across childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. This approach is based on recent evidence that points to the importance to adult health of the early years of life. In this life course perspective, the poorer health of disadvantaged individuals is seen to result from ongoing and cumulative exposure to difficult and disadvantaged circumstances across their life course. This study will trace and follow up a cohort of almost 10, 000 South Australians for whom social, familial, economic and dental behavioural information was collected in 1991-92 when these individuals were aged from five to 15 years. Now aged from 19 to 29 years, these individuals will be invited to attend a dental examination and complete a survey that will provide information on health behaviours and life circumstances shown to be important determinants of general and oral health status. One purpose will be to explore reasons for the comparatively poorer oral health status of Australian adults. A second purpose will be to investigate the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in oral disease at different life stages.

So far, no studies have been conducted,anywhere in the world, which have objectively examined the medical effects of 'ecstasy' in the dance clubs where it is used. Because of this, there is a lot of speculation on whether the animal based or hospital based studies are valid and relate to normal recreational use of this drug. This has led to a degree of suspicion by users and health professionals as to the medical problems claimed to be associated with the drug. This project extends a pilot study we undertook which has highlighted that in a recreational setting it is likely that specific individuals are susceptible to damage by 'ecstasy'. The purpose of this project is to examine this in detail, and identify who, and why some young persons are at risk of immediate life threatening outcomes from 'ecstasy' use or may develop brain damage later. The intended outcome is to provide clear evidence of adverse effects and why they occur. This evidence may be used to improve harm minimisation and treatment programs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jason White","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022947","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"White","source_individual_id":"RMIS1018187","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jason White"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82913","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Rodney Irvine","data":{"first_name":"Rodney","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013861","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Irvine","source_individual_id":"RMIS25405","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Rodney Irvine"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80436","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6186","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Risk of birth defects in children born following infertility treatment","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Birth defects in ART children","Obstetrics","Paediatrics","Reproductive Medicine","Safety of infertility treatment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349475,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Birth defects","Long term outcomes of infertility treatment","Neonatal care","Safety of Infertility treatments"],"scientific_title":"Risk of birth defects in children born following infertility treatment","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Michael DAVIES","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349475","simplified_title":"Birth defects and infertility treatment","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"191962.5","source_system":"The development of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility treatment has advanced at a tremendous pace since late 1970's. The use of ART is becoming increasingly frequent, with Australia having one of the highest rates of use internationally. Over 4,000 births result from ART annually in Australia. At the same time, minimally invasive infertility treatment-ovulation induction and insemination, remains a main option for some infertile couples and also generates several thousand births annually. A fundamental concern for those involved in infertility treatment is the health of the children born following the treatment. Evidence from many studies indicates that compared to the general population, ART babies are more likely to be a twin or triplet, have a low birth weight, be born premature, and suffer higher rates of perinatal death and cerebral palsy. These issues are gradually being addressed by transferring a single embryo in a cycle. Of greater concern is the recent reporting by a Western Australian team that the risk of major birth defects is doubled in ART children. This is a highly significant finding that has raised concern in patients and clinicians. It is imperative to verify the findings through replication in a larger study. It is equally important to identify whether the increased risk is due to potentially modifiable treatment factors or patient factors related to their infertility. This innovative study will therefore also separate patient characteristics and type of treatment, and partition the risk attributable to various factors. The health of children from infertility treatments is of fundamental concern and has become an important public health issue. This study will direct future basic research in embryology and clinical services where there is a continual need to balance technical innovation and efficacy with treatment safety. The long-term benefit will be improvement of the health status of Australian families."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Annabelle Chan","data":{"first_name":"Annabelle","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041535","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chan","source_individual_id":"RMIS2341533","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Annabelle Chan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87777","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Eric Haan","data":{"first_name":"Eric","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031063","middle_name":"Albert","last_name":"Haan","source_individual_id":"RMIS231552","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Eric Haan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85048","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Davies","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030274","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Davies","source_individual_id":"RMIS62012","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Davies"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84850","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Jim Wang","data":{"first_name":"Jim","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0028659","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wang","source_individual_id":"RMIS456743","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jim Wang"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84423","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michelle Lane","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026134","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lane","source_individual_id":"RMIS2282530","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michelle Lane"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83760","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6185","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["cells","extracellular matrix","follicle","hormones","ovary"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349473,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349473","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"789824","source_system":"I am a basic scientist with an interest in the cellular biology of the ovary, and the roles of the matrix between cells of the ovary in controlling fertility and hormone synthesis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers","data":{"first_name":"Raymond","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027648","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Rodgers","source_individual_id":"5017235","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84138","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6184","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single   previous caesarean section","data":{"media_summary":"Women's health","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Decision making","Evidence based clinical practice","Newborn infant","Prospective cohort","Women's health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349460,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Infant, newborn","Patient preference","Perinatal mortality and morbidity","Vaginal birth after previous caesarean","Women's health"],"scientific_title":"Planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single   previous caesarean section","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349460","simplified_title":"Planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single   previous caesarean section","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"741750","source_system":"In Australia over 1 in 5 women give birth by caesarean section.

Women are randomised to one of the two treatment groups. Half the women will receive a weekly intramuscular injection of corticosteroids up to the time of birth or 32 weeks gestation, whichever is earlier, whilst the risk of very preterm birth remains. The other half of the women will receive a saline placebo injection. Chance will decide which treatment the women receives. In this study all children who survive to 2 years corrected age will be assessed to see if they have any problems with their health, growth and development. In particular we will assess how well they can walk, talk, understand, see and hear. The trial will be able to assess whether repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids are helpful or not for infants at risk of being born very preterm by comparing the short term effects on infant health after birth and whilst in hospital with the effects on the child's later health, growth and development.

The majority of tumours are now small and potentially organ-confined. The use of nomograms, algorithms based on preoperative clinical features of these patients (serum PSA level, Gleason grade, clinical stage) has facilitated this process, but is imperfect as 20-30% of patients experience disease relapse within 5-7 years. Tumours with similar preoperative clinical features have markedly different outcomes, reinforcing the inadequacy of current approaches to determining whether or not an individual patient has organ-confined disease. A new approach is to incorporate into the standard diagnostic nomograms, biological features from preoperative core biopsy linked to the process of disease relapse, and which independently predict patient outcome risk group. Our preliminary studies using a small hypothesis-generating cohort of patients with early stage prostate cancer determined that elevated levels of androgen receptors (AR) in malignant epithelial cells and reduced levels of AR in peritumoral stromal cells independently predict disease relapse after surgery. In this project, AR measurements will be analysed in independent cohorts of patients derived from two Australian institutions to determine whether the predictive value is maintained across multi-Institutional cohorts. Selected androgen-regulated markers of tumour growth and spread (proliferative, apoptotic, metastatic) will be examined in microarrayed postoperative tissue samples. The postoperative markers will be examined for independence of prediction of relapse. Independent markers will be examined for ability to increase predictive efficacy in standard diagnostic nomograms. Levels of the two markers with greatest predictive value will be measured in preoperative core biopsies and tested for predictive ability as a prelude to clinical practice."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Carmela Ricciardelli","data":{"first_name":"Carmela","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039311","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ricciardelli","source_individual_id":"5012271","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Carmela Ricciardelli"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87188","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028408","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS102344","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Villis Marshall","data":{"first_name":"Villis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026522","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Marshall","source_individual_id":"5030803","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Villis Marshall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83856","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Horsfall","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013741","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Horsfall","source_individual_id":"RMIS102338","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Horsfall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80403","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6181","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.","data":{"media_summary":"muscular diseases","end_year":2007,"keywords":["calcium channels","excitation-contraction coupling","fatigue","muscle contraction","skeletal muscle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349456,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["muscle contraction","muscle damage","muscle fatigue","muscle weakness","muscular diseases"],"scientific_title":"Role of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Giuseppe Posterino","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349456","simplified_title":"Cellular oxidants and antioxidants on skeletal muscle contraction.","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"163250","source_system":"Excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling is a term used to broadly describe the sequence of cellular events that starts with an electrical signal at the surface membrane of a muscle cell and which then ultimately leads to muscle contraction. Although the overall sequence is known, there remain many gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms involved not only related to normal muscle function but to how this function may be impaired by excessive exercise and disease. Many cellular metabolites contribute towards the normal control of muscle contraction, while others contribute to its impairment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which includes nitric oxide (NO) and related molecules, are metabolic factors often referred to as cellular oxidants. They are thought to have an essential role in controlling normal muscle function. Paradoxically, they are also implicated in the impairment of muscle function associated with fatigue, disease and aging. How these molecules both control normal muscle activity and also contribute to impairment of such function remains unclear. Thus, the central aim of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which the cellular oxidants, NO and other ROS, both control normal E-C coupling in skeletal muscle fibres and how they contribute to muscle fatigue. Clearly, understanding how skeletal muscle normally contracts is essential in order to better understand how muscle function can become impaired with exercise, disease and age. The work from this study will provide insight into both normal muscle physiology and how muscles fatigue and ultimately provide new methodologies and drugs that may combat fatigue, disease and age related changes to muscle function."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Giuseppe Posterino","data":{"first_name":"Giuseppe","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0033228","middle_name":"","last_name":"Posterino","source_individual_id":"RMIS679439","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Giuseppe Posterino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85611","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6180","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neuroplasticity and hand motor skill","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Neuroplasticity","hand","motor cortex","motor unit","transcranial magnetic stimulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349452,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["dystonia","rehabilitation of hand function","stroke"],"scientific_title":"Neuroplasticity and hand motor skill","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Michael Nordstrom","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349452","simplified_title":"Cortical control of the fingers in humans","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"218000","source_system":"Experience drives changes in the connections between neurons in the brain.

The proposed research is consistent with this priority as we will achieve a better understanding of the cortical control of human jaw muscles, which serves as the foundation for understanding conditions in which their function is impaired, and the development of rational therapies for these conditions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to activate the motor cortex and corticobulbar descending pathway to the jaw muscles. The AIM 1 study will provide important new information about the functional organisation of the motor cortex in the control of jaw muscles during speech. This information is needed to improve understanding of dysarthria, a common disturbance of speech due to impaired muscular control following unilateral cortical stroke, and less common conditions involving speech motor control such as spasmodic dysphonia (a cranial dystonia) and dysprosody (disturbance of speech articulation and rhythm found in Parkinson s disease). The AIM 2 and 3 studies will provide a comprehensive characterization of cortical inhibitory mechanisms that are an important but poorly understood component of the cortical control of jaw muscles. This information is necessary to understand normal function, and the mechanisms of disturbances to jaw muscle function with neurological disease or injury. The AIM 4 studies will show whether impaired cortical inhibition contributes to the pathophysiology of two poorly understood disorders affecting jaw muscles (bruxism and oromandibular dystonia). Current therapies for these conditions are unsatisfactory, due to a limited understanding of the mechanisms involved. If cortical inhibition is abnormal in these conditions this will lead to novel treatment therapies (e.g., drugs to correct the imbalance, or strategies to induce plastic change in the cortex)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Kemal Turker","data":{"first_name":"Kemal","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0045934","middle_name":"","last_name":"Turker","source_individual_id":"RMIS24245","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Kemal Turker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88889","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Timothy Miles","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0014991","middle_name":"","last_name":"Miles","source_individual_id":"RMIS8338","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Timothy Miles"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80761","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Philip Thompson","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0010642","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thompson","source_individual_id":"RMIS337164","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Philip Thompson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79587","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Nordstrom","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003701","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Nordstrom","source_individual_id":"RMIS14824","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Nordstrom"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77691","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6178","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Tooth emergence and oral streptococci colonisation: a longitudinal study of Australian twins","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Dental Development","Dental Genetics","Oral Biology","Oral Health","Twins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349448,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Dental Caries","Dental Development","Dentistry","Oral Health"],"scientific_title":"Tooth emergence and oral streptococci colonisation: a longitudinal study of Australian twins","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dentistry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Grant Townsend","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349448","simplified_title":"Tooth emergence and oral health in twins and their families","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"521600","source_system":"We plan to include over 500 Australian families of twins in this 5-year study and to collect records of tooth emergence, cheek cells for DNA analysis, dental plaque samples for microbiological analysis, as well as other information from questionnaires. Firstly, we want to learn how genetic and non-genetic factors influence the timing and sequence of emergence of primary (baby) teeth. Most children get their baby teeth between the ages of 6 months and 2.5 years, but sometimes they appear earlier, even at birth, and some children don't get all their baby teeth until about 4 years. By studying identical twins and non-identical twins we will be able to work out whether genetic factors are most important in determining this variation or whether other factors such as diet or illness also play a significant role. Secondly, we want to find out whether there is a relationship between the timing of emergence of the primary teeth and the growth of bacteria in the mouth that may lead to dental decay. It seems that the most likely source of the bacteria that can cause dental decay is a baby's mother and that children infected before three years of age are more likely to get dental decay subsequently. We will determine when decay-producing bacteria first appear in the mouth and check whether the same types of bacteria are present in twins and their mothers. This information will enable us to sort out whether the process that allows bacteria to become established around the teeth has a strong genetic basis or not. If we can gain a better understanding of how genetic and environmental factors influence dental development, we will be in a better position to manage individuals with altered tooth emergence that can lead to crowded teeth. Furthermore, if we can demonstrate a link between tooth emergence, growth of oral bacteria, and development of dental decay, we should be able to determine the most effective time to introduce preventive measures to control dental disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Grant Townsend","data":{"first_name":"Grant","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045897","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Townsend","source_individual_id":"5017965","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Grant Townsend"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88877","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Theo Gotjamanos","data":{"first_name":"Theo","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036917","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gotjamanos","source_individual_id":"RMIS221448","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Theo Gotjamanos"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86558","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Toby Hughes","data":{"first_name":"Toby","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025628","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Hughes","source_individual_id":"5015368","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Toby Hughes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83601","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Neville Gully","data":{"first_name":"Neville","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013394","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Gully","source_individual_id":"RMIS2348126","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Neville Gully"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80319","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof W.

collectively as lysosomal storage disorders (LSD). As a result of the deficiency of specific enzymes or proteins involved in the breakdown of sphingolipids (fats), there is an accumulation of this material in affected cells. These diseases can affect liver, spleen, kidney, bone and the central nervous system. Gaucher disease is the prototype for the sphingolipidoses and, in this project, we will use this disease as a model for this group of disorders. Gaucher disease in the most prevalent LSD with an incidence of 1:56,00 births, worldwide there are approximately 2300 affected individuals born each year. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Gaucher disease has been successful in the treatment of the non-neuropathic form of the disease. However ERT is expensive ($200,000-400,000 pa). There are approximately 50 Australian patients undergoing ERT at a cost of at least $10 million per annum. However, due to the high cost of treatment, many people do not qualify for ERT, despite having serious medical problems. Worldwide, there are approximately 4000 people currently receiving ERT for Gaucher disease at a total drug cost of over $1.0 billion pa. However, based on birth rates and life expectancies there are over 80,000 Gaucher patients in the world. With the current cost of ERT it is likely that over 90% of these will never receive ERT. If therapy is to be made available for the majority of affected individuals, cheaper alternatives will be required. In this project we will use cellular models of Gaucher disease to study the processes leading to the disease and to develop alternative, cheaper therapies for this disease and other types of sphingolipidoses, for which no therapies currently exist."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Meikle","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038512","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Meikle","source_individual_id":"RMIS26385","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Meikle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86973","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Hopwood","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019701","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Hopwood","source_individual_id":"RMIS2987678","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Hopwood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82019","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Maria Fuller","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013121","middle_name":"","last_name":"Fuller","source_individual_id":"RMIS2275256","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Maria Fuller"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80244","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6169","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"PROTEIN PROFILING FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND MONITORING OF LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS AND OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES","data":{"media_summary":"screening","end_year":2007,"keywords":["diagnostic techniques","lysosomal enzymes","newborn infant","protein profiling","proteomics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349411,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["developmental/genetic disease","diagnostics tests and procedures","lysosomal storage disease","monitoring effectiveness of treatment","screening"],"scientific_title":"PROTEIN PROFILING FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND MONITORING OF LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS AND OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Diagnostic Applications","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"BIOTECHNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Peter Meikle","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349411","simplified_title":"PROTEIN PROFILING FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF GENETIC DISEASE","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"469500","source_system":"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are a group of more than 45 progressive genetic diseases, that result from the absence or impaired function of a specific enzyme in each of the body's cells. Lysosomes rid the cell of excess waste. Impaired enzyme function halts this process and waste begins to accumulate (or 'store') in the cell. Disease severity and patient longevity is variable, but severely affected patients often die by their mid-teens. LSD can affect the skeleton and joints, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, the brain, the eyes, the ears and the airways. As affected children become older, symptoms worsen. Patients often require frequent hospitalisation, and medical and surgical intervention. Approximately 10 to 15% of the general population are affected or carriers of an LSD. In Australia, one LSD child is born in every 5,000 live births. Diagnosis often takes several years, and families often have other children before their affected child is diagnosed. LSD are, therefore, a considerable burden to not only the families but also to the health care system. The goal of the Lysosomal Diseases Research Unit is Diagnosis at birth and effective therapy for lysosomal storage disorders. To this end we have been working toward the development of a newborn screening program for LSD and improved methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of therapy in this group of diseases. In this project we propose to develop and evaluate the use of protein profiling (looking at many diagnostic markers at the same time) to achieve these goals. The technology developed in this project will have potential application beyond LSD. Lysosomal dysfunction has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; in addition lysosomal proteins are reported to be involved in the spread of some cancers and may be useful markers for early detection. We will collaborate with other research groups to further develop protein profiling in these areas."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michael Fietz","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042366","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Fietz","source_individual_id":"RMIS226943","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michael Fietz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87991","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Meikle","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038512","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Meikle","source_individual_id":"RMIS26385","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Meikle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86973","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Douglas Brooks","data":{"first_name":"Douglas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029621","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Brooks","source_individual_id":"5013616","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Douglas Brooks"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84673","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Hopwood","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019701","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Hopwood","source_individual_id":"RMIS2987678","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Hopwood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82019","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6168","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Improving the safety characteristics of lentiviral vectors.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Gene therapy","Insertional mutagenesis","Lentiviral vectors","Retroviral vectors","Self inactivating"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349402,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Genetically influenced disease","Inherited disease"],"scientific_title":"Improving the safety characteristics of lentiviral vectors.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Therapy","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOTECHNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Donald Anson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349402","simplified_title":"Safer vectors for gene therapy","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"296250","source_system":"Gene therapy holds great promise for the treatment of many types of disease including inherited disorders, cancer and cardiovascular disorders. However, the potential of gene therapy has in many cases been limited by the lack of suitable technologies for gene delivery. We have developed a novel gene delivery vehicle from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Although this vehicle has many of the characteristics desired of a gene therapy vector its derivation from a retrovirus, particularly one with such an unenviable reputation, raises obvious safety concerns. In order to properly address this issue it is necessary that the vector is carefully designed and properly tested. This project aims to continue our rational, systematic and stepwise approach to the development of our vector with the aim of producing a vector that can be used with a high degree of confidence in its safety, such that it is suitable for clinical usage. Given the highly desirable properties of these vectors, and the wide range of diseases where their use is being considered, the availability of such a vector will have great significance for the widespread practical application of gene therapy. Indeed, several of the projects we are developing with our vector will in all likelihood lead to lead to clinical trials and it is clear that the conduct of these trials will depend on the availability of a suitable vector."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Donald Anson","data":{"first_name":"Donald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035119","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Anson","source_individual_id":"RMIS9114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Donald Anson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86105","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6166","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"How does the environment cause stress to oocytes and embryos and what are the consequences to fetal outcomes?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["ART","in vitro","oocyte stress","pre-compaction stage"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349389,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"How does the environment cause stress to oocytes and embryos and what are the consequences to fetal outcomes?","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Michelle Lane","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349389","simplified_title":"How does the environment cause stress to oocytes and embryos and what are the consequences to fetal outcomes?","sub_type":"RD Wright Biomedical CDF","total_budget":"336125","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michelle Lane","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026134","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lane","source_individual_id":"RMIS2282530","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michelle Lane"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83760","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6165","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Australasian randomised clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open surgical treatment of colon cancer: Follow-up.","data":{"media_summary":"Safety of laparoscopic versus open resection of colon cancer","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Colon cancer","Laparoscopic resection versus open resection of colon cancer","Prospective randomised multicentered controlled trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349381,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["3 and 5 year survival following resection of colon cancer","Colon cancer","Disease free interval following resection of colon cancer","Port site metastases in laparoscopic resection of colon canc","Safety of laparoscopic versus open resection of colon cancer"],"scientific_title":"Australasian randomised clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open surgical treatment of colon cancer: Follow-up.","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Surgery","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Mr Peter Hewett","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349381","simplified_title":"Australasian Laparoscopic Colon Cancer Study (ALCCaS): Follow-up.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"233000","source_system":"Colon cancer is one of the most common solid tumours in western society. The usual initial treatment is excision of the cancer by an operation done through a cut down the midline of the abdominal wall. Over the past 15 years, minimally invasive technology has changed the approach to many surgical operations. A good example of this is an operation to remove the gall bladder. This is now routinely done using a laparoscope (telescope) which is introduced at the umbilicus. An image on a video screen of the gall bladder is then used to guide instruments to remove the gall bladder without making a large incision in the abdominal wall. This is called a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety of a laparoscopic assisted approach in the removal of colon cancer is yet to be determined. This study will compare the long term and short term outcomes of people who have colon cancers removed whether by laparotomy ( a cut in the midline of the abdominal wall) or by a laparoscopic assisted approach (telescope)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael

disease of the lungs principally caused by cigarette smoking. COPD is very common and causes a great deal of debility and mortality in our community. COPD is also linked to an increased risk of lung cancer and carviovascular disease. It is estimated to cost Australians at least $800 million dollars per year in health related costs. Despite its importance, there is a limited understanding of how COPD develops and treatment options are limited. We have identified large numbers of dying cells in the airways of people with COPD and we believe that these play a critical part in the cause and-or progression of the illness. This project will determine whether the increased rates of cell death are the result of the COPD process or part of the actual cause of the disease. This knowledge will enable us to address the urgent need to predict the risk of developing COPD in current and ex- smokers. Cells obtained from the lungs of healthy controls, current- ex smokers without COPD and current- ex smokers with COPD will be studied. The effects of current treatments for COPD on these cells as well as testing novel treatments will also be studied, paying particular attention to the effects on cell death. In this way we hope that new therapies will be identified to improve the health and well-being of those with COPD."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Greg Hodge","data":{"first_name":"Greg","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0043074","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hodge","source_individual_id":"5015282","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Greg Hodge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88162","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Holmes","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031369","middle_name":"","last_name":"Holmes","source_individual_id":"RMIS219010","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Holmes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85122","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Reynolds","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021691","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Reynolds","source_individual_id":"5017186","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Paul Reynolds"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82577","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Sandra Hodge","data":{"first_name":"Sandra","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007906","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hodge","source_individual_id":"5015290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Sandra Hodge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78835","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6159","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Oesophageal, gastric and small intestinal motility in critical illness","data":{"media_summary":"Trauma","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Absorption","Critical illness","Enteral nutrition","Oesophageal and Upper Gastrointestinal Motility","Pathophysiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349329,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Critical iIlness","Head injury","Malnutrition","Sepsis","Trauma"],"scientific_title":"Oesophageal, gastric and small intestinal motility in critical illness","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Intensive Care","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Robert Fraser","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349329","simplified_title":"Motility and absorption in critical illness","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"494250","source_system":"A major concern in critically ill patients is the provision of adequate nutrition to facilitate recovery from devastating insults.

The applicants, with the support of the NH and MRC, have had a longstanding interest in motility disorders of the gut and have made important contributions to knowledge about both the causes and treatments of the disturbances that occur in the oesophaus, stomach and small intestine. In the previous grant (207753) these studies have provided the most comprehensive studies to date of the motor abnormalities associated with gut dysfunction in critical illness which have important implications for treatment.

In the kidney, ENaC activity is responsible for maintaining sodium balance, blood volume and blood pressure. In the lung ENaC function is required for fluid clearance. Abnormal regulation of ENaC is associated with conditions such as hypertension, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary oedema. Delineating the molecular basis of the regulation of ENaC is vital in understanding disease mechanisms and in defining targets for novel therapeutics for the treatment of disorders that arise due to sodium imbalance. Furthermore, ENaC and the molecules involved in the channel regulatory cascade are potential candidate genes in defining the genetic causes of human hypertension and salt wasting disorders. Previous studies from our laboratories and by other groups have shown that Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 proteins are key players in regulating ENaC activity. Our recent NHMRC supported work has identified another important protein, Grk2, as a regulator of ENaC. The work proposed in this application is an extension of our recent findings and will enable us to fully define how Nedd4-Nedd4-2 and Grk2 regulate the activity of ENaC."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Cook","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012444","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Cook","source_individual_id":"5014030","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Cook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80065","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sharad Kumar","data":{"first_name":"Sharad","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008480","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kumar","source_individual_id":"RMIS11591","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78992","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Anuwat Dinudom","data":{"first_name":"Anuwat","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006983","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dinudom","source_individual_id":"RMIS71462","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Anuwat Dinudom"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78596","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6156","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Immune-regulation by milk extracts in vitro as well as in vivo in an animal model of formula feeding","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["biotechnology","growth factors","immune development","infant nutrition"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349307,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Immune-regulation by milk extracts in vitro as well as in vivo in an animal model of formula feeding","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Irmeli Penttila","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349307","simplified_title":"Immune-regulation by milk extracts in vitro as well as in vivo in an animal model of formula feeding","sub_type":"Industry ECF","total_budget":"369500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Irmeli Penttila","data":{"first_name":"Irmeli","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015529","middle_name":"Auli","last_name":"Penttila","source_individual_id":"5011377","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Irmeli Penttila"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80917","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6155","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A Randomised Trial of DHA in Pregnancy to Prevent Postnatal Depressive Symptoms and Enhance Neurodevelopment in Children","data":{"media_summary":"pregnancy","end_year":2008,"keywords":["child development","dietary fatty acids","docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)","maternal nutrition","postnatal depression"],"nhmrc_grant_id":349301,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["child development","dietary fatty acids","nutrition in pregnancy","postnatal depression","pregnancy"],"scientific_title":"A Randomised Trial of DHA in Pregnancy to Prevent Postnatal Depressive Symptoms and Enhance Neurodevelopment in Children","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Maria Makrides","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/349301","simplified_title":"DHA to Optimise Mother Infant Outcome (DOMInO)","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"1649000","source_system":"Postnatal depression strikes 12-17% of women in the year after giving birth.

Enriching diets with DHA has also been associated with improvements in visual and neural abilities of young infants. Normally, DHA is obtained through the mother's diet and is then passed onto the developing baby whilst in the womb. However, the amount of DHA that is delivered to the baby in pregnancy is high, and in most cases is far higher than most Australian mothers get in their diets. In this study we will test whether supplementing the diets of pregnant women with DHA results in women suffering less depressive symptoms and children with better development scores.

This cushion or matrix plays an active role in egg release, transport and fertilization. Proper formation of this cushion just before egg release is therefore essential for efficient female fertility. This project examines the role of newly identified proteins and protease enzymes that are involved in the formation and function of the matrix cushion around eggs.

Hence, the purpose of this proposed research is to document the nature, distribution and determinants of oral health among South Australian 29 year olds so as to identify points of intervention to maintain Australian's improved oral health further into adulthood. The specific aims of the research are to document the oral health of a cohort of 29 year olds describe their dental life history and key proximate influences on their oral health identify significant determinants of their oral health to compare the cohort with a representative SA sample of the same age. This project will approach some 3,763 29 year old adults who participated in earlier research as 13 year olds in 1988-89. It will also compare these adults with a random sample of 557 further 29 year olds from the SA Electoral Roll. Participants will be interviewed and then dentally examined, providing a range of key outcome measures on oral health status and explanatory factors from when they were 13 years old, their dental history and circumstances as 29 year olds. The research project is expected to provide detailed documentation of the prevalence and severity of oral disease and its distribution in an adult cohort, and exploration of the dental life history and current determinants of the oral disease observed. It is anticipated that the strength of hypothesised relationships of determinants will have direct policy implications."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Brennan","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023769","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Brennan","source_individual_id":"RMIS376265","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Brennan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83104","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof A.

Under low oxygen (hypoxia) individual cells switch on a number of different genes required to increase red blood cell production and blood flow, and decrease oxygen consumption. This may be under environmental situations such as high altitude, but is also an important part of many human diseases, such as heart attack and stroke (where a clot stops blood flow and oxygen delivery) or cancer (where tumours require oxygen for growth). We have known for sometime that a few key proteins are activated by hypoxia, such as the HIF proteins, and these act as a master switch to turn on numerous other genes. However, the actual oxygen sensors have remained a mystery. Recent research by others and myself has identified a number of the oxygen sensors, which are hydroxylase enzymes that require oxygen. Under normal conditions with ample oxygen they modify the HIF proteins and keep them inactive, but when oxygen is limiting they can't modify the HIFs and the unmodified HIF is active. So far four different oxygen sensors have been identified, but there is strong evidence for more sensors, and they are likely to modify more targets than just the HIFs. This project aims to identify new oxygen sensing hydroxylases and novel targets, and determine what they each do. I already have some preliminary information as to what some of the other oxygen sensors might be and also some of their likely targets. This work should greatly enhance our understanding of how the body responds to hypoxia, both under normal conditions and during disease. These oxygen sensors might also be very useful drug targets. For example, drugs that inhibit these enzymes should increase the activity of the HIF proteins and facilitate a more rapid response by the body to a heart attack or stroke, and thus limit the damage, whereas drugs that activate the enzymes would inhibit the HIFs and be useful in limiting tumour growth."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Daniel Peet","data":{"first_name":"Daniel","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039025","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Peet","source_individual_id":"RMIS443359","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Daniel Peet"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87112","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5319","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification and function of posttranslational modifications in the Dioxin Receptor/Arnt transcription factor","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["intracellular receptor","mass spectrometry","posttranslational modification","transcription factor","xenobiotic metabolism"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299053,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["environmental pollutants","toxicity","tumour promotion"],"scientific_title":"Identification and function of posttranslational modifications in the Dioxin Receptor/Arnt transcription factor","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Murray Whitelaw","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/299053","simplified_title":"Analysing amino acid modifications during activation of the dioxin receptor","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"448500","source_system":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are prevalent environmental pollutants which cause a wide range of deleterious health effects.

While in many cases PAHs are oxidised to compounds which are water soluble and excretable (and therefore harmless), some substrates, such as benzo[a]pyrene found in cigarette smoke, can become inadvertently transformed into carcinogens. Other pollutants such as dioxin are resistant to metabolism and are extremely toxic.

Although there have been improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, there are no effective treatments for advanced (metastatic) disease that has spread to other parts of the body. Currently, the only therapy for advanced disease involves the reduction in circulating androgens such as testosterone by surgical or medical castration, i.e. androgen ablation. Because prostate cells are dependent on testicular androgens for their survival, surgical or medical castration results in an initial tumour regression. However, tumours inevitably develop resistance to current forms of androgen ablation therapy. Inappropriate activation of androgen signalling by non-testicular androgens or other agents may stimulate tumour growth following androgen ablation. In this study, we aim to identify and characterise determinants of the specificity and sensitivity of activation of the androgen receptor, which is the primary mediator of androgen action. Current androgen ablation treatments for prostate cancer only target the availability of androgenic ligands. We propose that it is also necessary to target the androgen receptor itself, because it can be activated by ligands other than testicular androgens. Therefore, we will also evaluate a panel ofagents that target different aspects of the androgen signalling axis, combined with androgen ablation using a cyclical approach to prevent or delay disease progression."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Lisa Butler","data":{"first_name":"Lisa","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029717","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"5013717","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Lisa Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84691","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028408","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS102344","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Villis Marshall","data":{"first_name":"Villis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026522","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Marshall","source_individual_id":"5030803","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Villis Marshall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83856","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5316","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of mechanoelectric feedback in cardiac arrhythmogenesis","data":{"media_summary":"ventricular fibrillation","end_year":2006,"keywords":["arrhythmia","cardiac contraction","electrophysiology","ion channels","stretch"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299042,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["atrial fibrillation","cardiac arrhythmia","heart disease","ion channel dysfunction","ventricular fibrillation"],"scientific_title":"The role of mechanoelectric feedback in cardiac arrhythmogenesis","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

It used to be thought that the electrical and mechanical functions of the heart muscle were essentially separate: the electrical activity triggered contraction something like pulling the trigger of a gun- once events were in motion, the electrical events played no further role. However, in recent years it has become apparent that this is an over-simplification of the real situation. In fact, the electrical activity of the heart is influenced strongly by the degree and timing of stretch to which the heart muscle is subjected, a process called Mechano-electric feedback. Since it can be demonstrated in isolated tissues, mechano-electric feedback must be an intrinsic property of the heart muscle. It has been shown in isolated heart preparations that passive stretch produces electrical disturbances in the normal action potential shape and propagation and that these electrical disturbances can be powerful enough to generate severe arrhythmias. There are paralells in human diseases. For example, atrial arrhythmias are common in older people, and it seems that these may be due to chronic stretch of the atria, as a consequence of high blood pressure. In addition, in those patients recovering from a heart attack, it seems likely that the damaged part of the heart muscle subjects the surrounding tissue to unusual mechanical stresses, and may trigger arrhythmias. This project aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying this mechano-electric feedback, in an attempt to understand some types of arrhythmias. Using molecular biology techniques, we will look at the gene expression of a novel type of stretch-activated potassium channel in both healthy and diseased animal hearts, with the aim of seeing if changes in the level of expression of these channels is correlated with changes in the response of the heart to stretch."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Saint","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033585","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Saint","source_individual_id":"RMIS5653","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Saint"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85694","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5315","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification of factors essential for oocyte viability","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["embryo development","oocyte competency","oocyte maturation","pregnancy establishment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299037,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["fetal growth","infertility","multiple births","polycystic ovarian syndrome"],"scientific_title":"Identification of factors essential for oocyte viability","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Michelle Lane","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/299037","simplified_title":"Quality of in vitro matured oocytes","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"220500","source_system":"Approximately 2% Australia children are now conceived using in vitro fertilisation technologies, allowing infertile couples to bear their own children. However, a major consequence of IVF techniques is multiple pregnancies (i.e. twins and triplets) which is a major health risk to mothers and their infants. Furthemore, IVF increases birth defects, which are mostly attributed to the increased multiple pregnancies, but is also observed in pregnancies involving a single infant. It is essential that IVF techniques are developed that enables the transfer of a single embryo to the mother resulting in the birth of a single healthy baby, without the ethical concerns of surplus embryo disposal. Women receiving IVF are required to adminster hormones that stimulate the eggs in their ovaries to mature to the point where they can be fertilised by their partner's sperm. These hormones, called gonadotrophins, override the body's own ovarian stimulating system and cause many eggs to mature and be collected for fertilisation, instead of normally just one. In this way, the best embryo(s) can be selected for transfer back to the mother, and other embryos can be frozen and stored for later use. However, large doses of gonadotrophins has consequences. They can be dangerous to some patients who are sensitive to their potency, and stimulate a massive response. They also reduce the quality of eggs and subsequent embryos, which reduces the chances of a pregnancy. All this can be avoided if eggs can be collected from ovaries in an immature state and maturation achieved in the laboratory. However, although attempted, this has not been a successful technique, primarily because we don't understand the process of human egg maturation. Our research will investigate the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of non-human eggs and embryos resulting from eggs that are grown and matured in the laboratory, to develop techniques for the successful maturation of human eggs in the laboratory."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michelle Lane","data":{"first_name":"Michelle","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026134","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lane","source_individual_id":"RMIS2282530","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Michelle Lane"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83760","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5314","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Acute bronchitis in general practice: what factors predict a poor outcome and can antibiotics help?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Epidemiology","General Practice","Infectious Disease","Primary Health Care","Respiratory Disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299032,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Acute Bronchitis","Acute respiratory illness","Use of antibiotics in the community"],"scientific_title":"Acute bronchitis in general practice: what factors predict a poor outcome and can antibiotics help?","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Nigel Stocks","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/299032","simplified_title":"Acute bronchitis in general practice: can antibiotics help some patients?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"393750","source_system":"In Australia acute bronchitis is one of the commonest reasons for patients to attend their general practitioner. It can have considerable impact on patients lives with patients coughing on average for two weeks, with a third spending some time in bed and a quarter not returning to their usual activities for many weeks. If they attend a general practitioner (GP) it is likely they will receive antibiotics. But researchers believe that antibiotics are over prescribed for this condition and the emergence of bacterial resistance is a real concern to health authorities. GPs are therefore being urged to reduce the prescription of antibioics for this common condition. But surveys by the National Prescribing Service (NPS) indicate that this is one area where GPs find it difficult to meet national recommendations. In part this may be because GPs do not wish to undertreat or miss a serious respiratory illness. Also results from randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of antibiotics for acute bronchitis suggest some benefit from treatment, at least in some patients. However it is not clear who these patients are and how much benefit they would get from receiving antibiotics. This creates a great deal of uncertainity for GPs who then opt for a 'just in case prescription' for everyone presenting with acute bronchitis. Our study will re-examine the symptoms, and clinical findings of patients presenting to their GP with acute cough and explore the impact of this common illness on patients lives. We will determine who does and does not benefit from antibiotics, and give guidance to GPs about the symptoms, clinical findings and investigations that predict a poorer outcome. Evidence from this study will be incorporated into treatment guidelines for acute bronchitis leading to more rational and effective management of this common problem."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Turnidge","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045946","middle_name":"Douglas","last_name":"Turnidge","source_individual_id":"5012496","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Turnidge"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88896","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Antony Veale","data":{"first_name":"Antony","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0034455","middle_name":"","last_name":"Veale","source_individual_id":"RMIS2287775","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Antony Veale"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85918","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nigel Stocks","data":{"first_name":"Nigel","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028186","middle_name":"Philip","last_name":"Stocks","source_individual_id":"RMIS987555","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nigel Stocks"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84279","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Crockett","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012547","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Crockett","source_individual_id":"5014123","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alan Crockett"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80097","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5313","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Relationships Between Human Osteoblasts and Haemopoietic Cells in Bone Remodelling","data":{"media_summary":"osteoporosis","end_year":2006,"keywords":["bone remodelling","differentiation","osteoblasts","osteoclasts","vitamin D"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299031,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["bone formation","bone turnover","osteoarthritis","osteoclastic bone resorption","osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Relationships Between Human Osteoblasts and Haemopoietic Cells in Bone Remodelling","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Gerald Atkins","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/299031","simplified_title":"The role of human osteoblasts in osteoclast formation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"436450","source_system":"Bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, currently afflict more than 4 million Australians.

We are seeking to better understand the factors that regulate bone remodelling, and particularly the cells involved in this process. Physiological bone remodelling results from the intimate collaboration between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts stimulate the formation of osteoclasts and also produce new bone at resporption sites. However, the way that the same type of cell can perform both these tasks, is not clear. Our studies are designed to increase our understanding of the development of human osteoblasts and of the factors that cause them to be sequentially pro-osteoclastic and then pro-osteogenic.

There is currently no evidence about exactly how practices can best be organized to provide this systematic care, in a way which improves the process of care and the health outcomes for patients. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of changing aspects of practice organization and structure, such as setting up registers of asthma patients, providing recalls or reminders to patients to come in for regular review, having the GPs provide education and self-management skills to patients, focusing on the contributions which practice staff can make to the process, and initiating quality assurance measures such as audit and feedback to the GPs about their quality of care. We anticipate that these changes will provide positive benefits for the patients, but will also investigate what it costs the practices, patients and government to bring these changes about, within the perspective of efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Preecclampsia may be life-threatening in up to 3% of all pregnancies and is a major cause of maternal death in pregnant women in Western countries. This project will examine the effect of treatment of the pregnant guinea pig with insulin-like growth factor-II on placental cell invasion and the capacity of the placenta to deliver nutrients to the fetus. We will also determine whether the effects of this treatment are mediated by a specific membrane receptor on the cell surface of the invading placental cells.

Until recently, it was assumed that CP was a result of foetal asphyxia during birth. However, recent studies suggest that asphyxia around the time of birth accounts for less than 6% of all CP cases. In the remaining cases the neuropathology becomes established during pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that maternal infection (bacterial and possibly viral), and also inherited fetal clotting disorders are often implicated in the development of CP. It is now possible to test stored dried blood spots from babies who subsequently developed CP.

Current treatments can only limit the gradually-increasing lung disease and is costly. Our new gene therapy technique introduces a correcting gene into affected airway cells, and it has already worked in the first tests in mice bred with CF. Airways in mice are used to test whether the effect is reliable, effective, and lasts long enough to be useful. The gene is introduced into the airway using special virus delivery-particles, after conditioning the airway to make it receptive to the particles. The method works in normal mice and in CF mice; it gives long lasting gene transfer from a single dose and seems to affect all airway cell types. The gene transfer may also be occurring in airway stem cells, i.e. the mother cells from which grow all the cells of the airway surface. Until now, no-one else has been able to produce prolonged gene transfer in this way, nor arrange gene transfer into stem cells in live airways. There are now a number of things that we must investigate before we could conduct safety and effectiveness trials in larger animals, or consider moving into clinical trials in humans. We need to understand exactly how our conditioning agent works and is it safe; measure how long the gene correction can last actually in our animals; decide if we can we re-dose animals (if needed) without losing effectiveness because of inflammation or immune responses that might occur; and decide how important the airway stem cells are in producing the length of the gene transfer. Because it has been difficult to measure gene correction in CF airways, we will also test new ways we have developed to measure how well the gene correction works in CF airways. The findings of this project will allow us to develop our method to where we can test it in larger animals, to provide a strong, long-lasting gene correction that will be safe for testing in human clinical trials."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Parsons","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044718","middle_name":"Webb","last_name":"Parsons","source_individual_id":"RMIS199391","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Parsons"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88567","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Donald Anson","data":{"first_name":"Donald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035119","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Anson","source_individual_id":"RMIS9114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Donald Anson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86105","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5302","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of modified IGF-binding proteins as novel anti-cancer chemotherapeutics","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Breast Cancer","Cell proliferation","Growth factor","IGF","Prostate Cancer"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298975,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Development of modified IGF-binding proteins as novel anti-cancer chemotherapeutics","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof John Wallace","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298975","simplified_title":"Development of novel anti-cancer chemotherapeutics","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"77375","source_system":"We propose to enhance the effectiveness of current anti-cancer treatments by co-administering a protein to sequester growth factors that promote the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy.

The clinical outcome for patients with this disease is extremely poor, with median survival of only 6-9 months. The latest developments in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and radical surgery have done little to improve the overall survival rate. New approaches to therapy are thus required. Oncolytic therapy using conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) is a novel and promising approach to cancer treatment. This strategy relies on selective viral replication in (and therefore death of) tumour cells but not normal cells. In principle, mesothelioma is an attractive target for this therapeutic approach owing to its propensity to remain localised to the pleural space until late in the disease. However, for any CRAd strategy to succeed, viral replication must be limited to the tumour cells so as not to cause unnecessary toxicity to normal tissues. This level of specificity can potentially be achieved by using cell-specific promoters to control the expression of viral genes essential for replication. To date however, there have been no reports evaluating candidate mesothelioma-specific promoters in adenoviral vectors. Furthermore, other issues such as tumour a lack of viral receptors or tumour-associated fibrosis could limit viral spread through a mesothelioma mass and reduce the efficacy of the approach. In this proposal we will contruct and test CRAds which are controlled by promoters which we believe will be highly active in mesothelioma, but very poorly active in other tissues. We will test the ability of these new agents to kill mesothelioma cells in tissue culture, in pieces of mesothelioma tumours removed from patients, and in animal models. If successful, this approach could offer new hope for mesothelioma patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Holmes","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031369","middle_name":"","last_name":"Holmes","source_individual_id":"RMIS219010","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Holmes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85122","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Reynolds","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021691","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Reynolds","source_individual_id":"5017186","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Paul Reynolds"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82577","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Lake","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008500","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Lake","source_individual_id":"RMIS171055","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Lake"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79002","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5298","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of mechanotransduction in primary visceral afferents","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Mechanotransduction","Nerve-Gut Interactions","Sensory Neurons","Visceral Sensation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298942,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Functional gastrointestinal Diseases","Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease","Gastrointestinal motor abnormalities","Visceral Pain"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of mechanotransduction in primary visceral afferents","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ashley Blackshaw","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298942","simplified_title":"Gut feelings - the basis of detection of mechanical forces","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"253500","source_system":"Mechanotransduction is the process whereby mechanical stimuli are converted into signals in sensory nerves. This forms the basis of touch, hearing, position sense and many aspects of internal perception. It also constitutes a major component of pain. Our group aims to discover the molecular basis of mechanotransduction in mammals, and in particular how it relates to signaling of events in the digestive system. We and our collaborators have been among the first to explore this question, and have found that three genes are responsible for many aspects of mechanotransduction. Each gene is transcribed to produce a channel or pore in the membrane of sensory nerve fibres which responds to mechanical forces by allowing ions to enter and induce electrical signals. Our early findings in mice with disruption of individual genes indicate that a complex positive and negative interaction of these channels must underlie normal mechanotransduction. However, these channels must represent only a part of the transduction mechanism, with extracellular and intracellular anchors inevitably playing a major role. The identity of such anchoring proteins in mammals is currently emerging, and we are fortunate to have access to mice deficient in specific genes that will provide information about candidates for this role. Through our studies on mechanotransduction in the digestive system in parallel with our collaborators' studies on mechanotransduction in skin we shall not only identify the fundamental mechanisms of mammalian mechanotransduction, but also reveal which components of mechanotransducers are peculiar to the gut. Such peculiarities provide molecular targets for therapy of diseases in which alteration of mechanosensory signaling is itself an aim."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ashley Blackshaw","data":{"first_name":"Ashley","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029484","middle_name":"Laurence","last_name":"Blackshaw","source_individual_id":"5013485","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Ashley Blackshaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84644","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Stuart Brierley","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023778","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Brierley","source_individual_id":"5013610","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Stuart Brierley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83109","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Amanda Page","data":{"first_name":"Amanda","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009504","middle_name":"Jayne","last_name":"Page","source_individual_id":"RMIS173004","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Amanda Page"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79283","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5297","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular and cellular mechanisms of skeletal disease mediated by plasma cell dyscrasias","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["aberrant bone remodelling","cytokine activation of osteoblast and osteoclast function","haematological cancer which is metastatic to bone","osteosclerotic and osteolytic bone disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298935,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["cancer cell-mediated osteolysis","cancer cell-mediated osteosclerosis","haematological malignancy","orthopaedic osteolysis"],"scientific_title":"Molecular and cellular mechanisms of skeletal disease mediated by plasma cell dyscrasias","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Haematology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Andrew Zannettino","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298935","simplified_title":"Skeletal disease mediated by haematological malignancy","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"432750","source_system":"Osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions of bone are common sequelae of primary and secondary bone cancers, including cancers of hematological origin. There is now strong evidence that tumor cells perturb the local balance between bone resorption and formation, and in cases of osteolysis, cause increased osteoclast (OC)-mediated bone resorption without a matching amount of bone formation. This proposal arises from our extensive clinical and basic science experience with multiple myeloma (MM) in addition to other skeletal tumors, and our strong background in both OC and osteoblast biology. MM is a hematological malignancy characterised by plasma cell dyscrasia, which typically causes progressive and severe destruction of the skeleton, with accompanying bone pain, fracture and finally, hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Two related diseases, MGUS and POEMS, have been chosen for study because of their key similarities and differences with MM, and are likely to shed new light on the activities of MM in the bone. MGUS does not cause identifiable bone defects, whereas POEMS can give rise to both osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions. Comparison of these conditions will uniquely enable us to examine why these seemingly related neoplasms are able to mediate disparate skeletal disease states. Primarily, and since there are few curative therapies for MM at present, our proposed studies are designed to identify targets for therapy that will treat the most serious manifestation of this disease, namely its destruction of bone tissue."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017304","middle_name":"Christopher William","last_name":"Zannettino","source_individual_id":"RMIS362660","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81407","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins","data":{"first_name":"Gerald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005872","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Atkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS228986","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78304","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Luen To","data":{"first_name":"Luen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005052","middle_name":"Bik","last_name":"To","source_individual_id":"RMIS379055","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Luen To"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78077","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5296","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Vitamin D Depletion and Femoral Bone Loss","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Bone architecture","Hip fracture","Osteomalacia","Osteoporosis","Vitamin D"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298933,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Ageing","Hip fracture","Nutrition","Osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Vitamin D Depletion and Femoral Bone Loss","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Howard Morris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298933","simplified_title":"Vitamin D requirement for skeletal health","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"399750","source_system":"Hip fracture remains the most devastating of the osteoporotic fractures particularly in women, in whom the incidence increases to about 3% per annum by the ninth decade.

Thus, it has become a primary focus of inquiry to understand how estrogen specifically functions in breast cancer but not in normal tissues. Estrogen serves different functions involving a series of biochemical reactions called signal transduction pathways that can couple estrogen to a specific function, such as cancer formation. We have recently found that a enzyme named sphingosine kinase (SK) activation triggers a novel signal transduction pathway in regulation of cell growth and tumour formation, and that this pathway was activated by estrogen in human breast cancer cells.

Ageing is associated with a reduction in appetite and food intake, which has been called the anorexia of ageing. After about age 70, on average, this is associated with loss of body weight, mainly of muscle. The physiological anorexia and weight loss of ageing predispose to pathological weight loss and malnutrition, which is associated with increased morbidity and death rates. High rates of under-malnutrition have been reported among older institutionalised people in the USA and Australia, with lesser, but still substantial, numbers of community-dwelling older people also undernourished. We found recently that 43% of 250 older recipients of domiciliary care services living in their homes in Adelaide were either malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, and had significantly worse outcomes than their well-nourished counterparts over the following year, including increased falls and hospitalisations. Little research has been done to identify underlying causes and develop treatments for this problem. Recent studies, including ours, have shown that upper gastrointestinal (GI) factors (stomach mechanics, rate of gastric emptying, GI hormones including ghrelin, cholecystokinin [CCK] and amylin) have important effects on appetite and food intake, and are often affected by ageing in ways that reduce food intake The proposed studies will investigate this upper GI control of appetite and its contribution to the anorexia of ageing. We will investigate the effects of ageing on gastric factors, including ghrelin release, the satiating effects of CCK and amylin, and the appetite stimulating effects of ghrelin. The expected outcome of this project is a greater understanding of the causes of the anorexia of ageing, enabling the logical development of effective prevention and treatment strategies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ian Chapman","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029881","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Chapman","source_individual_id":"RMIS11738","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ian Chapman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84734","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Horowitz","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002272","middle_name":"","last_name":"Horowitz","source_individual_id":"5020423","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77291","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5291","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional characterisation of N4WBP5 and N4WBP5A, novel Nedd4-interacting proteins","data":{"media_summary":"Lysosomal storage disease","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Nedd4","Nedd4-binding proteins","Protein trafficking","Ubiquitin","Vesicle transport"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298921,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Disease mechanisms","Genetic disorders","Hypertension","Lysosomal storage disease"],"scientific_title":"Functional characterisation of N4WBP5 and N4WBP5A, novel Nedd4-interacting proteins","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298921","simplified_title":"The role of novel proteins in intracellular trafficking","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"480750","source_system":"The proteins that make up a cell must be correctly localised in order to perform their normal function. Specialised cellular activities are carried out in distinct compartments within a cell and proteins must correctly localise in them and traffic between them. Intracellular protein trafficking is a highly regulated process involving many components. Recent findings have shown that intracellular trafficking is regulated in many cases by distinct protein modifications. One such modification is tagging of a small protein called ubiquitin to proteins that are being trafficked. A focus of research in our laboratory is the study of a protein, called Nedd4, which directly tags proteins with ubiquitin. We have recently identified two novel proteins that interact with Nedd4 and localise to distinct subcellular compartments that are sites for the correct sorting and delivery of proteins trafficking within the cell. The main aim of our proposal is to characterise how these proteins function. We propose that these proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking and that they may function by targeting Nedd4 to the cellular trafficking machinery. This may be required for Nedd4 to tag molecules with ubiquitin that are involved in intracellular trafficking. Our experiments will test the functional relationship between Nedd4 and the novel proteins and determine the particular trafficking pathways in which these proteins are involved. Defects in cellular processes regulated by Nedd4 and other similar proteins cause a number of human diseases including an inherited form of hypertension and a specific group of cancers. In addition, a large number of human diseases result directly from defects which disrupt intracellular trafficking pathways. The results of this study will provide further insight into this essential cellular process and may ultimately contribute to the development of therapies for diseases resulting from defects in intracellular trafficking."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Alan Munn","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038670","middle_name":"Leslie","last_name":"Munn","source_individual_id":"RMIS1725772","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Alan Munn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87019","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sharad Kumar","data":{"first_name":"Sharad","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008480","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kumar","source_individual_id":"RMIS11591","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78992","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5290","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Characterization of the role of substance P in oedema formation following stroke.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["ischaemia","neurogenic inflammation","neuropeptides","oedema","stroke"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298917,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Characterization of the role of substance P in oedema formation following stroke.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Renee Turner","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298917","simplified_title":"Characterization of the role of substance P in oedema formation following stroke.","sub_type":"Dora Lush Biomedical Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"73514.95","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Renee Turner","data":{"first_name":"Renee","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045944","middle_name":"Jade","last_name":"Turner","source_individual_id":"5018015","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Renee Turner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88895","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5289","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"evaluation of canine adenoviral vectors as a potential therapy for LSDs that affect the brain","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Adenoviral vectors","CNS","Gene therapy","Lysosomal storage","Metabolic disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298915,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"evaluation of canine adenoviral vectors as a potential therapy for LSDs that affect the brain","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Therapy","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"BIOTECHNOLOGY","cia_name":"Miss Adeline Lau","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298915","simplified_title":"evaluation of canine adenoviral vectors as a potential therapy for LSDs that affect the brain","sub_type":"Dora Lush Biomedical Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"74232.14","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Adeline Lau","data":{"first_name":"Adeline","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020278","middle_name":"Allison","last_name":"Lau","source_individual_id":"RMIS2666401","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Adeline Lau"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82175","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5288","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of beta-catenin and its regulator FAM in haemopoietic stem cell function","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Embryonic Stem Cells","Stem Cells","cre induced gene knockout","haemopoiesis","ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298903,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation","blood disorders","ex vivo stem expansion of stem cells","stem cell therapy"],"scientific_title":"Role of beta-catenin and its regulator FAM in haemopoietic stem cell function","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Adult HSC reside in the bone marrow and it is generally accepted that these rare cells cycle slowly and maintain themselves by a process involving self renewal. The cellular physiology that underlies HSC self renewal is still to be defined and no single factor has been described which is able to induce substantial proliferation and expansion of HSC in a defined system while maintaining critical stem cell properties. Like other SC, a critical characteristic of the rare HSC population of cells is their ability to maintain their unique stem cell properties in vivo (the process of self-renewal) while generating more committed cells which will form large numbers of differentiated and specialized mature blood cells. Recent evidence that HSC can repair other organs under some circumstances raises the possibility that this adult SC population could provide an alternative to embryonic stem cells for many stem cell therapies. If this is the case the therapeutic application of HSC becomes significantly broader. Critical to development of such applications will be an understanding of HSC self renewal and development and new approaches to expand this limited cell population. Major progress in this area will require the definition of both the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that control HSC maintenance and self-renewal. Any findings in this area will have major clinical significance and be of enormous benefit to the community. Here we focus on the role of a known intrinsic regulator of SC behaviour (beta-catenin) with the aim of establishing its role in the maintenance of HSC and its regulation by a novel cofactor (FAM). We will determine if the level of beta-catenin is critical in the maintenance and-or differentiation of haemopoietic stem cells and what role FAM plays in this regulation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Paul Simmons","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0027958","middle_name":"","last_name":"Simmons","source_individual_id":"RMIS7581","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Paul Simmons"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84214","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard D'Andrea","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018543","middle_name":"J","last_name":"D'Andrea","source_individual_id":"RMIS11290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard D'Andrea"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81748","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephen Wood","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005522","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Wood","source_individual_id":"RMIS192803","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephen Wood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78205","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5287","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Nutrition"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298902,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nutrition and Dietetics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Maria Makrides","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298902","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"602500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Maria Makrides","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032291","middle_name":"","last_name":"Makrides","source_individual_id":"5011980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Maria Makrides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85361","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5286","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Function of the Flightless protein in wound repair and scar formation in skin","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["conditional gene targeting","cytoskeletal components","scar formation","transgenic animals","wound healing"],"nhmrc_grant_id":298900,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["basic science","wound healing and scarring","wound reepithelialsation"],"scientific_title":"Function of the Flightless protein in wound repair and scar formation in skin","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dermatology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Allison Cowin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/298900","simplified_title":"Mechanisms of skin wound repair and scar formation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"472750","source_system":"Scarring is the inevitable outcome of wound repair and can cover a spectrum of conditions, from normal fine lines to unsightly, restrictive and deforming scars. Each year in the world over 100 million patients acquire scars, primarily from surgical procedures. Many of these scars cause considerable problems. Over 4 million burn scars occur every year, 70% of them in children. Poor wound healing is a major clinical problem and can result in loss of movement and deformity. These are especially important considerations for children, where their growth places extra demands on healing wounds and grafts, necessitating regular surgical adjustment. Scarring is an area of largely unmet medical need and development of new treatment strategies would have significant impact on public health. Changes in cell adhesion, shape and movement are important processes in wound repair. A framework of filaments, much like guy-ropes that support a tent, help coordinate these events. Remodelling of these filaments, shortening or extending them and making new connections, allows cells to change shape and respond to stimuli. This is a crucial event in repairing wounds and the proteins that perform this are fundamentally important to wound repair. We have discovered a protein in skin, known as Flightless, that is involved in this filament remodelling process. The goal of this project is to determine what Flightless does in wound repair. By changing the amount of this protein and comparing its effect in non-scarring and scarring animal wound healing models we can gain insight into its role in wound healing and scar formation in humans. The development of new animal models in this research and the discovery of the role of Flightless in wound repair will provide exciting new opportunities to improve wound repair and reduce scarring, with significant impact on public health."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Hugh Campbell","data":{"first_name":"Hugh","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023944","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Campbell","source_individual_id":"RMIS2297671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Hugh Campbell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83146","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Allison Cowin","data":{"first_name":"Allison","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012512","middle_name":"June","last_name":"Cowin","source_individual_id":"RMIS12622","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Allison Cowin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80084","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Barry Powell","data":{"first_name":"Barry","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004056","middle_name":"Crampton","last_name":"Powell","source_individual_id":"5011689","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Barry Powell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77799","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5285","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional analysis of the X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH) gene SOX3","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["X-linked genetic disorder","gene dosage","pituitary development","transgenic mouse models"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284545,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["congenital hypopituitarism","failure to thrive","familial growth hormone deficiency"],"scientific_title":"Functional analysis of the X-linked Hypopituitarism (XH) gene SOX3","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

This organ is located at the base of the brain and regulates these bodily functions through the release of six different hormones. Formation of the pituitary gland occurs during development of the foetus. This process requires a specific set of genes that shape the pituitary and allow the hormone-secreting cells to arise. Changes in these pituitary formation genes results in dysfunction of the pituitary (hypopituitarism) in newborn babies. In severe cases, where the pituitary has failed to form completely, these babies are extremely ill and in some instances do not survive. We are studying families with an inherited form of hypopituitarism in which only male children are affected. This disorder is due to the presence of an extra piece of genetic material (DNA) on the X chromosome. We have recently discovered that one of the duplicated genes, SOX3, causes this disorder. The overall aim of this proposal is to understand how SOX3 causes hypopituitarism by generating a mouse model for this disorder. Analysis of this mouse model will help us to understand the clinical features of hypopituitarism and may allow us to identify previously uncharacterised anatomical defects associated with this disorder. Ultimately,we hope to develop new and improved therapies for hypopituitarism using this mouse model."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Thomas","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028363","middle_name":"Quinton","last_name":"Thomas","source_individual_id":"RMIS537861","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Thomas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84333","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5183","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of sphingosine kinase and endothelial cell activation in autoimmun diseases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Diabetes","Endothelial cells","Inflammation","Rheumatoid arthritis","Sphingosine kinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":278806,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"The role of sphingosine kinase and endothelial cell activation in autoimmun diseases","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Claudine Bonder","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/278806","simplified_title":"The role of sphingosine kinase and endothelial cell activation in autoimmun diseases","sub_type":"Peter Doherty Biomedical ECF","total_budget":"308579","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Claudine Bonder","data":{"first_name":"Claudine","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023693","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Bonder","source_individual_id":"5013532","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Claudine Bonder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83085","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5035","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Motor unit synchronisation and neuromuscular performance","data":{"media_summary":"Spinal cord injury","end_year":2006,"keywords":["control of force","cross-correlation","motor unit synchronisation","muscle strength","tremor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":274307,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Disuse/Immobilisation","Parkinsons Disease","Pathological tremors","Spinal cord injury"],"scientific_title":"Motor unit synchronisation and neuromuscular performance","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Motor Control","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"HUMAN MOVEMENT AND SPORTS SCIENCE","cia_name":"Dr John Semmler","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/274307","simplified_title":"Motor unit synchronisation and neuromuscular performance","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"198500","source_system":"The fine control of force is important for many everyday tasks such as writing, grasping objects between index finger and thumb, and fastening buttons.

The goal of these studies is to explore the boudary conditions of the adaptive nature of the nervous system to examine how coordinated motor unit activity influences these aspects of neuromuscular performance. The outcomes of these experiments will identify if altering muscle activity influences the control of movement by altering single motor unit activity. These results will have direct application to the interpretation of abnormal movement control and tremor that is observed in certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

The system usually works well. Invading agents (the 'non-self') are detected and attacked by the immune system's patrolling killer T cells. These normally beneficial cells are called T cells because they were formed and educated in an organ called the thymus, which kick-starts our immune system in childhood, but falls into inactivity by adolescence. Sometimes the education system in the thymus goes wrong and it releases T cells that mistakenly attack 'self' instead of 'non-self'. This causes autoimmune diseases, such as type1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The Euro-Thymaide project aims to determine why and how self-attacking T cells are mistakenly released from the thymus into the body. Usually such errant T cells are detected and destroyed within the thymus, before they have the opportunity to escape and cause autoimmune diseases. The ultimate objective is to learn about the thymus recognition process and help the immune system detect and destroy faulty T cells that patrol the body, thereby preventing the onset of autoimmune diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Hamish Scott","data":{"first_name":"Hamish","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045331","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Scott","source_individual_id":"RMIS577378","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Hamish Scott"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88727","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4878","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Equipment Grant"],"nhmrc_grant_id":264518,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Ms Vada Osborn","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/264518","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"550228","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Vada  Osborn","data":{"first_name":"Vada ","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0009479","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Osborn","source_individual_id":"RMIS973288","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Vada  Osborn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79276","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4822","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Targeting protein kinase C in diabetes management using novel polyunsaturated fatty acids","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["diabetes","fatty acids","nephropathy","protein kinase C"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250483,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Targeting protein kinase C in diabetes management using novel polyunsaturated fatty acids","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biotechnology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Antonio Ferrante","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250483","simplified_title":"Novel polyunsaturated fatty acids that inhibit disease in diabetes","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"150000","source_system":"PKC regulates a diverse range of cellular processes in an isozyme-specific manner.

More importantly, inhibition of PKC_ with the PKC_-specific inhibitor, LY333531, blocks the actions of glucose. Recently, our research group designed and synthesised a family of novel polyunsaturated fatty acids. One of these, MP5 (_-oxa- 21:3n-3), inhibited high glucose-induced activation of PKC? in cultured mesangial cells as well as in glomeruli of diabetic rats in a relatively selective manner.

The specific aims are to: 1. Characterise the effects of MP5 on glucose- or advanced glycosylation end product-stimulated activation of protein kinase C (PKC). 2. Determine whether esterification of MP5 into diacylglycerol is essential for the action of MP5 3.

For example, dopaminergic neurons are lost progressively in Parkinson's Disease. A potential method of treatment is 'cell therapy' which envisages transplantation of cells back to the site of cell loss, and restoration of function. Application of the cell therapy approach is limited by the unavailability of cells for transplantation. Embryonic stem (ES) cells provide a potential solution to this problem because they can be grown in unlimited numbers and differentiated to any kind of cell that is found in the embryo or adult. In this application we propose to continue our work on controlling the differentiation of ES cells to neural lineages. Production of dopaminergic neurons will be a particular focus. We will establish conditions that enable the production of these cells in a manner that is therapeutically relevant and predicted to be acceptable to regulatory authorities. Cells will be tested by transplantation into adult rats to assess their therapeutic potential, in particular persistence, integration and differentiation within the brain environment. Research required to achieve the production of transplantable cells will also provide basic information about the mechanisms by which the mammalian embryo allocates cells, specifically cells of the nervous system, to specific lineages during embryogenesis. This information will be important for the production of other neural cell types, which have therapeutic potential for treatment of diseases like stroke, motor neuron disease and spinal cord injury."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Rathjen","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033337","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Rathjen","source_individual_id":"RMIS192806","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Rathjen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85632","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4414","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The effect of iron supplementation in pregnancy on child cognitive development","data":{"media_summary":"pregnancy","end_year":2004,"keywords":["child development","iron","maternal nutrition","pregnancy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250431,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["child development","iron deficiency","maternal and child health","maternal nutrition program","pregnancy"],"scientific_title":"The effect of iron supplementation in pregnancy on child cognitive development","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nutrition and Dietetics","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Maria Makrides","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250431","simplified_title":"Iron in pregnancy and child cognitive development","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"91562.5","source_system":"During fetal life the brain grows very rapidly and animal studies have shown that inadequate iron nutrition of mothers during pregnancy can result in permanent structural and developmental problems in the offspring.

It may be that the critical period where iron nutrition influences later development is in fetal life (during pregnancy). We have the opportunity to test whether iron nutrition in fetal life influences childhood development by assessing the cognitive abilities of children who were in our earlier study of iron supplementation in pregnancy.

Such forms of arthritis are referred to collectively as polyarthritis. There is a strong evidence that RA has an immunological basis and that abnormal recognition of components of the joints by T lymphocytes orchestrates the inflammation that is characteristic of the disease. We believe that dispersal of disease-causing activated T lymphocytes in the blood accounts for the involvement of many joints. We have used a model of polyarthritis in rats to study the nature of the activated T lymphocytes, where they come from, how they are delivered to the blood stream and how they enter the joints. This project focuses on the crucial tissues that line the joints. We want to understand how the disease-causing activated T cells cause inflammation and how the immune system reacts to restrain them. We can undertake this work because we have developed three unique tools. Firstly, we can transfer arthritis with activated T lymphocytes and, therefore, study their behavior in an otherwise normal body. In this way, we can see how the body responds to the presence of disease causing cells. Secondly, we have introduced a genetic marker, which is essential if one wishes to distinguish the separate activities of the donor' and host cells. Thirdly, we can collect cells from the diseased paws, allowing us to examine their activities in vitro as well as in vivo. This model offers the opportunity to study the activities of the disease-causing cells and to identify points at which the disease cycle can be broken. It will allow us to design and-or test new treatments aimed at these points."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Graham Mayrhofer","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044096","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mayrhofer","source_individual_id":"RMIS155314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Graham Mayrhofer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88428","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leslie Cleland","data":{"first_name":"Leslie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018309","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Cleland","source_individual_id":"RMIS120886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leslie Cleland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81689","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4412","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effect of lipid mediators and dietary fats in bone remodelling","data":{"media_summary":"osteoporosis","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Bone","Dietary fatty acids","Osteoclast","Osteoporosis","Prostaglandins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250411,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["chronic inflammation: rheumatoid arthritis","dietary fatty acids","dietary intervention","osteopenia","osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Effect of lipid mediators and dietary fats in bone remodelling","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Leslie Cleland","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250411","simplified_title":"Dietary fats and osteoporosis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"380250","source_system":"Osteoporosis in a major public health problem which directly affects about 10% of the population, which is currently around 2 million Australians. With aging of the population, it is projected that this proportion will increase to more than 13% over the next 20 years. When it is considered that the direct hospital and residential care costs attributable to osteoporotic fractures currently approaches $2 billion per annum, low-cost interventions for increasing bone strength which are easily applied to the elderly population have enormous potential for health benefits in Australia. Thus study will examine the effects of dietary omega-3 fats, of the kind found in fish and fish oil, on the biology of bone metabolism and on bone strength. The results will provide information which may be used in developing simple drug or dietary strategies for large-scale use for increasing bone mass and strength in the elderly population. A strength of the study arises from the combination of research expertise in (a) dietary fats, and (b) molecular biology of bone cells, and (c) animal models of bone metabolism which are amenable to dietary interventions. This combination is unique, but builds on well established systems which hitherto have existed in separate research paradigms. The Chief Investigator has considerable experience in development of diets enriched in omega-3 fats which are practical and suitable for daily use on a long-term basis. This adds considerably to the potential significance of the outcomes because, if favourable effects of omega-3 fats are observed and are characterised with regard to mechanisms, the results can be rapidly translated into large-scale clinical use."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Howard Morris","data":{"first_name":"Howard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032696","middle_name":"Arthur","last_name":"Morris","source_individual_id":"5011839","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Howard Morris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85470","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leslie Cleland","data":{"first_name":"Leslie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018309","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Cleland","source_individual_id":"RMIS120886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leslie Cleland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81689","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4411","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gestational diabetes: treatment with metformin compared to insulin","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Gestational Diabetes","Insulin","Metformin","Randomised controlled Trial","neonatal outcome"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250403,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["carbohydrate metabolism","hyperinsulinaemia","neonatal health","pregnancy"],"scientific_title":"Gestational diabetes: treatment with metformin compared to insulin","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr William Hague","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250403","simplified_title":"Metformin in Gestational diabetes (the MIG trial)","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"257400","source_system":"Gestational diabetes (GDM) is diagnosed when women have elevated blood sugar levels detected in pregnancy. Treatment aims to keep the mother's blood sugar normal and to prevent extra sugar transferring to the baby, as this can lead to elevated insulin levels, and subsequent complications, in the baby. Initial treatment is by diet, but more than 30% of women need further treatment with insulin injections. Metformin, which can be taken by as a tablet, is an alternative to insulin that is used widely outside pregnancy for people with diabetes. There are good data to support the safety of metformin in pregnancy. We plan to test that metformin is not only safe but also an effective alternative to insulin for women with GDM. Metformin works by reducing resistance to insulin, which is a key factor for the development of GDM and also for high blood pressure complications. We hope to demonstrate a reduction in these complications with metformin treatment. Metformin is associated with less weight gain than insulin and we hope to demonstrate an associated reduction in the risk of diabetes following pregnancy in women with GDM treated with metformin. It is likely that metformin crosses the placenta, and if so, it may reduce elevated insulin levels in the baby. The study will measure insulin levels in the cord blood, hoping to demonstrate that more babies have normal insulin levels in pregnancies treated with metformin."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof William Hague","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031071","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Hague","source_individual_id":"5015026","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof William Hague"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85050","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeremy Oats","data":{"first_name":"Jeremy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021193","middle_name":"Nicolle","last_name":"Oats","source_individual_id":"5016770","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jeremy Oats"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82432","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ross Haslam","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019503","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Haslam","source_individual_id":"RMIS207731","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Ross Haslam"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81965","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Peter Davoren","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018591","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Davoren","source_individual_id":"RMIS1590864","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Peter Davoren"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81764","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4410","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of cortical plasticity and facilitation of functional recovery following stroke","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["afferent stimulation","human","motor cortex","sensory cortex","stroke rehabilitation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250394,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cortical plasticity","motor function","sensory function","stroke rehabilitation"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of cortical plasticity and facilitation of functional recovery following stroke","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Michael Ridding","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250394","simplified_title":"Induced functional recovery following stroke","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"427500","source_system":"Specific regions of the human brain have been shown to reorganise following damage to the brain or peripheral nerves. This reorganisation is seen in both young and older subjects and is thought to be useful in helping to restore function. For example, following a stroke a patient may, initially, be unable to move one arm. However, in the following weeks and months some function may return. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for this improvement. However, it is likely that at least some of the improvement is due to reorganisation within the sensorimotor cortex. Following the stroke the control of the arm may be taken over by adjacent undamaged regions of the brain. This reorganisation allows impressive functional recoveries to occur. We have preliminary evidence to support the idea that patterns of activity generated in peripheral nerves (afferent input) following stroke may be crucial for the development of the organisational changes seen within the brain. We have shown that by applying specific patterns of sensory input we are able to produce organisational changes within the motor cortex of control subjects. Also, we have been able to induce similar changes in stroke patients. These changes have been accompanied by improvements in motor control. These novel and exciting findings support our hypothesis that by applying certain patterns of afferent input to patients following stroke we will be able to facilitate functional recovery by maximising reoganisation within the cortex. In the present project we will establish the organisation patterns in the brain of stroke patients and contrast the findings with control subjects. Secondly we will investigate the potential for facilitating recovery of stroke patients by the application of specific patterns of afferent input. These novel experiments may lead to important therapeutic developments that will benefit the large population of patients suffering strokes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Ridding","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027593","middle_name":"Charles","last_name":"Ridding","source_individual_id":"5017184","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Ridding"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84124","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Timothy Miles","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0014991","middle_name":"","last_name":"Miles","source_individual_id":"RMIS8338","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Timothy Miles"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80761","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Philip Thompson","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0010642","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thompson","source_individual_id":"RMIS337164","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Philip Thompson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79587","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4407","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Inhibition of estrogen signalling by androgen receptors: a potential mechanism for suppression of breast cancer growth.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Androgen receptor","Breast cancer","Estrogen receptor","HER2/neu","Ligand-independent activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250373,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Advanced breast cancer","Androgen therapy of breast cancer","Inhibition of estrogen signalling"],"scientific_title":"Inhibition of estrogen signalling by androgen receptors: a potential mechanism for suppression of breast cancer growth.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250373","simplified_title":"Inhibition of estrogen signalling and breast cancer cell growth by the androgen receptor.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"525000","source_system":"Breast cancer is a major health problem in Western countries including Australia, where it is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Breast cells require female sex hormones, called estrogens, for their growth and survival and consequently most current treatments for breast cancer aim to block the actions of these hormones in breast cancer cells. However there is still a large proportion of women who do not respond to these therapies or have an initial response but subsequently develop resistance. Evidence from our laboratory and others indicates that the male sex hormones, androgens, also play an important role in breast cancer. Androgens oppose the effects of estrogens in breast cancer cells, and inhibit their growth. Historically androgens were used to treat patients with advanced breast cancer, with good results, but the masculinising side effects (eg excess hair growth and acne) of these hormones led to a discontinuation of their use since the 1960s. The major objective of our current studies is to determine how androgens can stop breast cancer cells from growing by investigating the effects of the androgen receptor, which mediates the growth regulatory effects of androgens, in breast cancer cells. We believe that a better understanding of this signalling pathway could potentially lead to new treatments for breast cancer that act more specifically to inhibit cancer growth without the unpleasant side effects of androgenic drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Lisa Butler","data":{"first_name":"Lisa","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029717","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Butler","source_individual_id":"5013717","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Lisa Butler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84691","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028408","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS102344","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Stephen Birrell","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000412","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Birrell","source_individual_id":"RMIS229478","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Stephen Birrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76762","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4406","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The effect of adenotonsillectomy on neurocognitive functioning in children with upper airway obstruction","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Neurocognitive Assessment","Paediatric","Sleep","Sleep breathing disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250369,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Adenotonsillectomy","Neurocognitive and Behavioural Deficits","Obstructive Sleep Apnoea in Children","Snoring"],"scientific_title":"The effect of adenotonsillectomy on neurocognitive functioning in children with upper airway obstruction","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr John Kennedy","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250369","simplified_title":"Does the treatment of upper airway obstruction in children improve daytime functioning","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"185850","source_system":"Upper airway obstruction during sleep affects up to 3% of all children and is very frequently unrecognised.

However, there is little information on the effects of less severe degrees of upper airway obstruction in children but recent work suggests that reduced academic performance may also be present in children with relatively mild degrees of upper airway obstruction. In particular, the areas most affected appear to be intelligence, memory, behaviour and attentional capacity . Currently it is unclear whether these deficits are due to sleep disruption or reduced nocturnal oxygen levels. The treatment of upper airway obstruction is the removal of adenoids and tonsils, however, it is unknown whether or not this improves the child's intellectual capacity. This study aims to be one of the first to critically evaluate the impact of upper airway obstruction during sleep on children's intelligence, memory, behaviour and attentional capacity, and the improvements wrought by the removal of the child's tonsils and adenoids."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Kennedy","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025945","middle_name":"Declan","last_name":"Kennedy","source_individual_id":"5015683","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr John Kennedy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83693","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kurt Lushington","data":{"first_name":"Kurt","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020519","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lushington","source_individual_id":"5016085","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Kurt Lushington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82241","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000187","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Baghurst","source_individual_id":"5013272","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Baghurst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76706","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4405","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Understanding the role of nociceptin in PMNL-mediated inflammation in vivo","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["colitis","inflammation","neuropeptide","neutrophil"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250360,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["colitis","hyperalgesia","inflammatory disease"],"scientific_title":"Understanding the role of nociceptin in PMNL-mediated inflammation in vivo","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pathology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Shaun McColl","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250360","simplified_title":"A novel role for nociceptin in vivo","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"474750","source_system":"This work will study the role of a type of protein in white blood cell movement into tissues, a process called inflammation.

Extensive apoptosis occurs during foetal development which is required to get rid of many excess cells produced during the growth of the embryo. Selective apoptosis is also essential for the formation of different tissues and organs in developing foetus. In the adult, apoptosis is required for proper functioning of the immune system, to remove virus infected and cancer cells and in general to maintain the correct number of cells in the body. As such, misregulated apoptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of a wide array of diseases such as autoimmune diseases, many forms of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), heart disease, ischaemia and other conditions. To understand, manage and treat disorders that result from aberrant apoptosis, we need to know at molecular and cellular level, how apoptosis is brought about and how it is regulated. We have been studying these processes in detail for several years. Central to the apoptotic execution of cell death are a group of proteases that target many cellular proteins for specific cleavage. The activation of these proteases is the crucial step in the initiation of apoptosis and therefore each cell has developed complex ways to control this process. In the present proposal, we aim to study regulation of caspases that are involved in developmental apoptosis. Furthermore, we plan to identify proteins that are responsible for the regulation of caspase activation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sharad Kumar","data":{"first_name":"Sharad","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008480","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kumar","source_individual_id":"RMIS11591","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78992","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4402","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of Periprosthetic Bone Loss","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["bone loss/measurement by CT","cytokines and cell mechanisms","orthopaedic prosthesis/measurement of wear","polyethylene particles"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250344,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["natural history of bone loss","periprosthetic osteolysis/factors responsible","prosthesis loosening, migration, failure"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of Periprosthetic Bone Loss","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Findlay","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250344","simplified_title":"The factors that cause bone loss around orthopaedic hip prostheses","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"368000","source_system":"We will seek to address an important clinical problem in orthpaedics, namely the bone loss that commonly occurs around joint replacement prostheses. Termed peri-prosthetic osteolysis (PO), this bone loss can result in the loosening and ultimate failure and need for revision of the artificial joint components. PO is thought to be caused by the body's reaction to wear particles generated from the articulating surface of the prosthesis. However, it has not previously been possible to accurately explore the relationship between prothesis wear and PO, or the progression of PO, because of a lack of techniques to image and measure the volume of PO around metal prosthesis components. We have developed a means to accurately and reproducibly measure the volume of bone loss, using CT, and will do so longitudinally in joint replacement patients to obtain the first information about the progression of PO. New computer based methods will be used concurrently to relate prosthesis wear and migration parameters to PO. Patients who come to surgery for replacement of failed prostheses will be investigated further by analysis of the tissues involved in the bone loss around prostheses. Basic science experiments will seek to understand the underlying causes of PO and the findings will be important in interpreting the clinical results. An animal model will be used to seek approaches to inhibiting the pathological response to wear particles. The significance of these studies is that they will lead to improved outcomes for joint replacement patients, increasing the interval to revision surgery, which is both extremely costly and brings an attendant morbidity and mortality."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Donald Howie","data":{"first_name":"Donald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037378","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Howie","source_individual_id":"RMIS18497","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Donald Howie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86682","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Margaret Mcgee","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0026624","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Mcgee","source_individual_id":"RMIS1590217","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Margaret Mcgee"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83882","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Haynes","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002107","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Haynes","source_individual_id":"RMIS18488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Haynes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77248","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4401","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"human genetics and biology","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Genetics","Nervous system"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250340,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"human genetics and biology","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurogenetics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof Jozef Gecz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250340","simplified_title":"human genetics and biology","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"572000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jozef Gecz","data":{"first_name":"Jozef","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025021","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gecz","source_individual_id":"RMIS7756","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jozef Gecz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83435","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4400","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gastroduodenal motility and glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus","data":{"media_summary":"postprandial hypotension","end_year":2005,"keywords":["diabetes mellitus","duodenum","motility","radioisotopic methods","stomach"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250335,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["diabetes mellitus","gastrointestinal symptoms","gastroparesis","glycaemic control","postprandial hypotension"],"scientific_title":"Gastroduodenal motility and glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250335","simplified_title":"Effects of diabetes on stomach function. - The role of the stomach and glucose absorption in blood glucose control","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"393750","source_system":"The recent application of novel techniques to evaluate gastrointestinal motor function has established that the rate which the stomach empties food is abnormally slow in ~50% of people who have insulin-dependent (type 1) or non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes. Delayed stomach emptying was thought to be an infrequent complication in diabetes; much less common than damage to the eyes, kidneys or nerves. Abnormal stomach emptying may contribute to a number of problems in diabetes, including symptoms such as nausea and bloating, and poor control of blood glucose concentrations. It is now recognised that the blood glucose level itself has a reversible effect on both stomach contractions and symptoms. For example, when the blood glucose is abnormally high (hyperglycaemia), the rate at which the stomach empties food into the intestine is slower and symptoms, such as fullness, are greater. The rate of stomach emptying and the absorption of glucose from the intestine affect the rise in the blood glucose level after a meal; this is an important issue because it is desirable to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range to minimise the risk of both the development and progression of the complications of diabetes. In many people with diabetes eating a meal results in a substantial fall in blood pressure, which may cause fainting and falls. By slowing gastric emptying the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure is minimised. Our group has been the recipient of ongoing support from the NH and MRC for approximately 18 years to conduct research in this area. As a result we have performed the most comprehensive studies to date and developed new methods to evaluate stomach and intestinal function in people with diabetes, resulting in international recognition. The studies proposed in the current application represent a logical development from our previous work and have important implications for the management of diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andr Smout","data":{"first_name":"Andr","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045516","middle_name":"Jpm","last_name":"Smout","source_individual_id":"RMIS1613007","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andr Smout"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88777","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christine Feinle-Bisset","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030645","middle_name":"","last_name":"Feinle-Bisset","source_individual_id":"RMIS1585350","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Christine Feinle-Bisset"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84964","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Melvin Samsom","data":{"first_name":"Melvin","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0021921","middle_name":"","last_name":"Samsom","source_individual_id":"RMIS1613004","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Melvin Samsom"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82643","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Karen Jones","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002495","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Jones","source_individual_id":"5015532","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Karen Jones"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77345","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Horowitz","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002272","middle_name":"","last_name":"Horowitz","source_individual_id":"5020423","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77291","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4399","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The influence of acupuncture on reducing women's pain from primary dysmenorrhoea: a randomised controlled trial","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Acupuncture","Health care evaluation","Randomised clinical trial","Women's health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250325,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Complementary medicine","Dysmenorrhoea","Women's health"],"scientific_title":"The influence of acupuncture on reducing women's pain from primary dysmenorrhoea: a randomised controlled trial","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Primary Health Care","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250325","simplified_title":"How effective is acupuncture with reducing women's pain from primary dysmenorrhoea?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"310875","source_system":"Dysmenorrhoea refers to painful uterine cramps during menstruation. It is a common condition that affects as many as 50 percent of women. Severe menstrual pain can lead to an absence from work, or attending school, or interference with day to day lives. This condition is commonly treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the oral contraceptive pill. Studies suggest that between 30-50 percent of the adult population use some form of complementary medicine. Acupuncture, the insertion of fine needles, into specific areas of the body is increasingly being used to treat a number of conditions. It has been indicated in several non-clinical studies and two small clinical trials to be effective with treating dysmenorrhoea. Evidence from the Cochrane systematic review of acupuncture to treat primary dysmenorrhoea concluded acupuncture may be helpful. This study assesses whether women with dysmenorrhoea can be successfully treated using acupuncture. Women experiencing dysmenorrhoea with no underlying pelvic pathology will be offered the opportunity to take part in the trial. Women interested in taking part will be randomly allocated into one of two groups. One group of women will receive acupuncture, a second group will receive control (sham) acupuncture. The second study group involves the insertion of needles away from acupuncture points. Women will receive the treatment intervention for three menstrual cycles and then followed up for a further six months. Women will be asked to report on the pain they experience during menses and to report any time taken off from work or school, disruption with day to day activities, or the need for additional pain relief.

The earlier that a baby is born, the greater chance it has of having some developmental delay and general inability to cope at school. This has implications for the child, the families and the health system. One of the many dietary factors implicated in the development of neural abilities in premature infants is an omega-3 fatty acid called DHA. This compound is present in breast milk and most preterm formulas and is found in high concentrations in the brain and retina. In the last third of pregnancy the developing baby would normally accumulate DHA at a rapid rate. So it seems reasonable to assume that a baby outside the mother, that is born premature, would also need to accumulate DHA at this same rate. The problem is that none of the milks currently given to premature infants have DHA in high enough concentration to supply this amount of DHA to the baby. For example, breast milk and preterm formulas contain only a third of the DHA required. In order to provide this amount for the premature infant, breast milk containing DHA at about 1% of the total fat is required. Fortunately the level of DHA in breast milk can be increased to this level by supplementing the mothers diet with fish or olis like tuna oil. This study hopes to show that premature babies who receive DHA in amounts similar to that supplied in the womb will develop better than babies who receive low amounts of DHA."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Andrew Mcphee","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044217","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Mcphee","source_individual_id":"5016412","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Andrew Mcphee"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88458","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Karen Simmer","data":{"first_name":"Karen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039707","middle_name":"Norrie","last_name":"Simmer","source_individual_id":"5017517","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Karen Simmer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87299","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Maria Makrides","data":{"first_name":"Maria","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032291","middle_name":"","last_name":"Makrides","source_individual_id":"5011980","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Maria Makrides"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Scott Morris","data":{"first_name":"Scott","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0026872","middle_name":"","last_name":"Morris","source_individual_id":"RMIS1608632","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Scott Morris"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83957","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Gibson","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Davis","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006885","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Davis","source_individual_id":"RMIS76774","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Davis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78566","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4396","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel mechanisms of genotoxicity: bioactivation of carboxylic acid drugs by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Comet assay","DNA damage","UDP-glucuronosyltransferase","bioactivation","toxicology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250320,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["novel mechanisms of drug induced DNA damage","potentiation of genotoxicity by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases","prediction of the genotoxic potential of drugs"],"scientific_title":"Novel mechanisms of genotoxicity: bioactivation of carboxylic acid drugs by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Toxicology (incl.

Part of this testing involves ensuring that, within the body, they are not converted to chemically reactive forms able to damage DNA, since DNA damage can lead to cell toxicity or the development of cancer. Our laboratories have recently identified a new mechanism by which the body converts drugs to reactive chemicals called ester glucuronides. We have shown that some ester glucuronides can damage DNA. A large number of different drugs have the potential to form ester glucuronides. However, we do not know whether all ester glucuronides cause DNA damage or, if only some do, what properties determine their DNA damaging potential. In addition, most of the current pre-clinical screening of drugs can not detect DNA damage caused by ester glucuronides. We believe this lack of knowledge is of serious concern. Therefore, this project aims to: i) screen a large number of drugs for ester glucuronide-mediated DNA damage; ii) develop some preliminary methods of predicting the DNA damaging potency of these reactive chemicals; and iii) develop a screening test that may be more suitable for detecting DNA damage by ester glucuronides during pre-clinical testing.

The disease is incurable once it spreads beyond the confines of the prostate gland. Hormonal treatments can keep the cancer at bay for a number of years until they are no longer effective. Hormonal treatments cause shrinkage of prostate cancer because they interfere the function of the male hormone, testosterone, which encourages growth of prostate cancer. Hence, there is a need for other treatments that may improve the quality of life and survival of prostate cancer patients. It appears that a cancer patient can make immune cells known as T cells, which can recognise his own tumour but which are prevented from destroying the tumour. Using a mouse model of prostate cancer, we wish to understand how prostate tumours act to prevent immune destruction in circumstances that are common to the treatment of human prostate cancer. For example, hormonal treatments produce dead prostate cancer cells that will be cleared by the body's professional scavenger cells in a way that suppresses an active immune response against the tumour. To learn how the removal of dead cells suppresses the immune response, we propose to perturb the normal clearance of dead prostate cells by at least two means. First, we will study mice that have an inherited deficiency in the removal of dead cells. Second, these mice will be given a growth factor to produce an excess of immune stimulating cells known as dendritic cells in the prostate gland. The dendritic cell is the main type of cell that initiates immune responses. We will investigate whether the greater number of dendritic cells, which were put into the prostate gland by the growth factor, can remove the dead prostate cells in a way that excites rather than suppresses the anti-tumour immune response. Positive results obtained from these studies may lead to the design of new treatments for advanced prostate cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Hayball","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002095","middle_name":"Dominic","last_name":"Hayball","source_individual_id":"5011650","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr John Hayball"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77245","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Brown","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000583","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS10107","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76815","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4394","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The impact of declining tooth loss on oral health status and dental care utilisation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Oral epidemiology","Oral treatment needs","Provision of dental services","Use of dental services"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250316,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Dental caries","Periodontal disease","Tooth loss"],"scientific_title":"The impact of declining tooth loss on oral health status and dental care utilisation","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dentistry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"Dr David Brennan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250316","simplified_title":"The impact of declining tooth loss","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"144375","source_system":"Improved oral health has been well documented in Australia. Over recent decades the average number of decayed teeth among children has decreased. Among adults, the percentage with no natural teeth has also exhibited a decrease over time. While increased retention of natural teeth is an indicator of improved oral health status within the population, there may be some unexpected consequences of this success. Improved oral health has been associated with increased rather then decreased use of services. Improvements in oral health manifested in the form of greater tooth retention, coupled with demographic trends towards growth in the population, may lead to an increased risk of oral disease with flow on effects on need and demand for care. Findings from one cross-sectional study in the USA have shown that people who retained higher numbers of teeth had more periodontal disease and dental caries experience, and reported a past pattern of visiting the dentist more frequently. The specific aims of this project are to examine the association of the number of natural teeth among middle-aged Australians with their oral health status, treatment needs and subsequent use of dental services. The outcome of this project will provide answers to two research questions. Firstly, it will see whether the retention of more teeth among adults is associated with higher levels of oral disease. Secondly, by following people over time it will be able to detect whether those who are retaining more teeth into adult age ranges have higher levels of use of dental services than their counterparts with fewer teeth. The answers to both of these research questions has significance for policy and planning in the area of dental public health by providing evidence as to the size and direction of expected future demand for and use of dental services in Australia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kaye Roberts-Thomson","data":{"first_name":"Kaye","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045124","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Roberts-Thomson","source_individual_id":"5017198","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Kaye Roberts-Thomson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88684","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Brennan","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023769","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Brennan","source_individual_id":"RMIS376265","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Brennan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83104","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof A.

Adults who occupy higher positions on the social hierarchy experienced less disease and symptom experience, enhanced quality of life, and better self-rated oral health. Not only were associations made between social position and oral health, but a range of other factors such as personal control, social support, stress, life satisfaction, and workplace and childhood social environments were also associated with oral wellness. This work is new Australian research and is yet to be published. In an expansion of this project, we move from describing oral health inequalities and identifying their social determinants to provide a better understanding of pathways to population oral health. In doing so we shift the focus from the individual to the social context in which individuals live. We suggest that characteristics of social environments contribute independently to the variation in oral health outcomes accounted for by the characteristics of the residents themselves. In particular, we seek to demonstrate that social cohesion (the social integration, trust, and reciprocity within an area) influences conditions linked to oral health. Previous research has demonstrated variation in health according to area. Such studies are able to demonstrate a clustering of health, but are not able to distinguish whether observed social patterns in health reflect characteristics of residents or some feature of the area itself. Such conclusions require multilevel statistical models designed to separate individual effects from contextual effects while simultaneously examining interactions between both levels. Oral health is ideally suited as a proxy for general health because of the ubiquity of dental diseases, the broad utilisation of dental services within the population, and the shared risk factors between oral disease and a wide range chronic health conditions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gavin Turrell","data":{"first_name":"Gavin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028503","middle_name":"","last_name":"Turrell","source_individual_id":"RMIS221721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gavin Turrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84372","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anne Sanders","data":{"first_name":"Anne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016046","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Sanders","source_individual_id":"5017340","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Anne Sanders"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81045","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof A.

Vertebral deformity, intervertebral disc disorganisation, and change to vertebral bone structure are features associated with degeneration of the spine and with back pain. Degenerative disc disease is one of the major causes of back symptoms and is believed to be associated with degeneration of the spine. Spinal degeneration includes disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, compromised vertebral body bone quality, muscle and ligament alterations. It is assumed that these changes result in increased or abnormal spine motion and modified load distribution across the spinal joint. It has been found that with age, there is increased disorganisation of the intervertebral disc and decreased quality of vertebral cancellous bone. However, bones with the same density within the range of normal subjects, can show selective loss of bone structure and reduced load-bearing capacities of these vertebrae. An important concept here is that even for a given bone mass, fracture risk increases with age, supporting the view that there is a component of bone fragility that is independent of mass. Increased bone fragility may be associated with compromised cancellous bone structure. While the relationship between disc degeneration and changes in vertebral bone is commonly invoked, the mechanisms of this relationship have largely been overlooked, with age changes given more attention. However, it may be that intervertebral disc disorganisation modulates age-related bone changes within the spine. Disc degeneration may influence trabecular bone responses before changes with age put the patient at risk of vertebral crush fracture. We propose that the mature disc cannot effectively regenerate after damage, and thus responses to disc damage will be more readily observed in vertebral bone architecture than in the disc."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Trevor Hearn","data":{"first_name":"Trevor","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0025413","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hearn","source_individual_id":"RMIS151546","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Trevor Hearn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83541","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari","data":{"first_name":"Nicola (Nick)","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007214","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Fazzalari","source_individual_id":"RMIS5831069","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78651","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4390","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Relationships between diet and gastric motor function in functional dyspepsia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Appetite","Dietary fat","Gastric motility","Gastrointestinal symptoms","Nutrition"],"nhmrc_grant_id":242802,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Disordered gastric motility","Functional dyspepsia","Relation between nutrition and disease","Satiation/satiety and food intake"],"scientific_title":"Relationships between diet and gastric motor function in functional dyspepsia","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Christine Feinle-Bisset","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/242802","simplified_title":"Diet and gastric motor function in functional dyspepsia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"220500","source_system":"Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a condition characterised by abdominal symptoms without a cause that is identifiable by conventional diagnostic tests. Symptoms (eg fullness, bloating) are frequently induced by eating. 20 - 40 % of the adult population in Western countries are affected by FD, and the condition, therefore, represents a considerable financial burden to the health care system. FD affects quality of life adversely. In many people with FD, stomach contractions and the 'sensitivity' of the stomach are abnormal. Often, people with FD avoid fatty foods in the belief that these cause or exacerbate symptoms. There is, however, little information about the potential role of dietary habits in causing symptoms, the relationship between eating and disturbances in stomach function, and the impact of dietary changes on symptoms. Our previous studies suggest an important role for nutrients, particularly fat, in FD. We will address the hypothesis that dietary factors, particularly fat intake, have substantial implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of FD. Our studies will involve physiological (stomach emptying, appetite and food intake) and epidemiological (dietary habits, dyspeptic symptoms and quality of life-related aspects) measurements. The subjects-patients with FD will receive standardised test meals of varying nutrient composition, and we will study the effects on their stomach and on symptoms. We will also test some medications in an attempt to alleviate symptoms during and after food ingestion, particularly after fatty foods. Other studies will assess the dietary habits of patients with FD in relation to symptom occurrence and investigate the possibility that dietary intervention (reduction of fat content in the diet, exclusion of offending foods) will benefit these patients. The proposed studies will provide the most comprehensive studies to date of the relationship between symptoms in patients with FD with dietary habits and stomach function."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christine

Grant","total_budget":"481320","source_system":"Treatment of infertility using IVF technology has been enormously successful. However, there are major concerns regarding the high incidence of multiple pregnancies (caused by the transfer of more than one embryo) and the potential adverse health outcome of adults conceived from this technology. Multiple pregnancies place both mother and infant at enormous risks, with increased obstetrics care, prematurity, increased neonatal care and neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy. This can be overcome simply by the transfer of a single embryo. However, patient and clinical expectations are that single embryo transfer should be achieved with little to no reduction in pregnancy rate, and currently this is not possible because our methods for culturing embryos are inadequate. Studies in animals suggest that laboratory growth of mammalian embryos can lead to small-for-gestational age babies (even when the effect of multiple births is taken into consideration). This backed by recent studies which agree that babies born from IVF are smaller than expected. This might lead to health problems in later life, as smallness at birth is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, especially as age progresses beyond 40 years. However, the oldest IVF child is currently 23 years of age. Previously we have shown that a protein growth factor, called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), found normally in the reproductive tract, has dramatic beneficial effects on human and mouse embryos grown in the laboratory. Furthermore, we have shown in mice that embryo exposure to GM-CSF alleviates the detrimental side effects of in vitro culture on foetal growth and body structure after birth. Our research is now focussed on understanding why this protein is beneficial to embryo growth and to test if we can increase pregnancy rates and produce normal healthy infants from the transfer of single embryos treated with GM-CSF."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jeremy Thompson","data":{"first_name":"Jeremy","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016642","middle_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"Thompson","source_individual_id":"5011723","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Jeremy Thompson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81222","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sarah Robertson","data":{"first_name":"Sarah","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015909","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Robertson","source_individual_id":"5012391","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Sarah Robertson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81010","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3964","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Recombinant bacteria expressing oligosaccharide receptor mimics for prevention of enteric infections","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["adhesins","enteric bacteria","enteric infections","receptor mimicry","toxins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":250355,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Recombinant bacteria expressing oligosaccharide receptor mimics for prevention of enteric infections","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof James Paton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250355","simplified_title":"Harmless bacteria for prevention of gut infections","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"451056","source_system":"Gastrointestinal infectious diseases kill more than 3 million people each year. The principal microbial pathogens responsible for these infections are known to exploit oligosaccharides on the surface of host cells as receptors for ahesins or toxins. We have developed (and patented) a novel anti-infective strategy, based on mimicry of oligosaccharide receptors for toxins and adhesins produced by enteric pathogens on the surface of harmless carrier bacteria. Oral administration of such recombinant probiotics has the potential to prevent enteric infections by binding and neutralizing toxins in the gut lumen and by blocking adherence of the pathogen to intestinal epithelial cells. As a prototypic example, we have developed a bacterium capable of preventing the serious consequences of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) infections; this agent binds Shiga toxin with very high efficiency and is 100% protective in animal models. The strategy has very broad applications, however, and receptors for virtually any pathogen can be mimicked by expression of appropriate glycosyl transferases in a suitable harmless host bacterium.

When oxygen levels become limiting, the body attempts to rectify the situation by increasing the number of oxygen carrying red blood cells and promoting development of new blood vessels to increase the blood supply to tissues. Cells also adapt by altering their internal biochemistry and metabolism to decrease energy needs. These changes are the result of a genetic reprogramming within the cells. A major question is how the cells sense they are in a low oxygen environment and by what mechanisms they initiate genetic reprogramming. We are studying two proteins which have the ability to alter activity of genes when cells are stressed by hypoxia (low oxygen), and seek to discover how the proteins switch from latent forms to active forms in response to hypoxia. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the cellular hypoxic response is important to the development of new therapeutics for disease states involving disrupted oxygen flow (eg heart attack and stroke). Drugs which would block the hypoxic induced development of blood vessels could also be extremely beneficial in cancer treatment, as blocking blood supply to growing tumours can result in their starvation and shrinkage."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Murray Whitelaw","data":{"first_name":"Murray","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040430","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Whitelaw","source_individual_id":"RMIS443356","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Murray Whitelaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87475","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Daniel Peet","data":{"first_name":"Daniel","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039025","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Peet","source_individual_id":"RMIS443359","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Daniel Peet"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87112","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3298","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Induction of Reactive Oxygen Species by Hepatitis C Virus and its Role in Liver Pathogenesis.","data":{"media_summary":"Therapeutic Intervention, new targets","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Gene Array","Hepatitis C Virus","Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Oxidative stress","Viral Pathogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207817,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Disease pathogenesis","Hepatitis C related liver disease","Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Therapeutic Intervention, antioxidants","Therapeutic Intervention, new targets"],"scientific_title":"Induction of Reactive Oxygen Species by Hepatitis C Virus and its Role in Liver Pathogenesis.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr MICHAEL BEARD","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207817","simplified_title":"Oxidative Stress in HCV Related Liver Disease","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"376320","source_system":"The majority of individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) show a slow progression of liver disease over a period of 20-30 years. There is increased scaring of the liver which can result in liver failure and in some individuals liver cancer. Due to the lack of suitable model systems to study HCV infection and disease progression there is no currently available vaccine and treatment options are limited. While the host defense mechanisms to HCV are relatively well studied the role that viral proteins and viral replication play in the development of liver disease are not well characterized. Previous experiments in the laboratory have shown that one of the hepatitis C virus proteins results in the formation of toxic oxygen molecules known as a reactive oxygen species. This toxic oxygen molecules can have an effect on liver cells that may enhance the progression of the liver disease process in hepatitis C virus infected individuals. The role that these molecules play in liver cells is unknown but experiments are planned in laboratory model systems and in specimens obtained from hepatitis C virus infected individuals to further examine potential mechanisms. This will hopefully lead to the identification of new treatments for hepatitis C virus liver disease. Some patients with hepatitis C will develop liver cancer, however, all the reasons are not known. Using new technology known as microarray, a consequence of the human genome project, we have been able to look at the expression levels of thousands of genes in liver cancer. Experiments are planned to determine if these genes are important in liver cancer and if they can be used as targets for therapy or to more easily diagnose liver cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Beard","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029360","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Beard","source_individual_id":"RMIS1033698","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Beard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84611","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3297","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"AUSTRALASIAN MULTICENTRED PROSPECTIVE RANDOMISED STUDY OF LAPAROSCOPIC VS CONVENTIONAL SURGICAL TREATMENT OF COLON CA","data":{"media_summary":"Safety of Laparoscopic vs Open Ca Resection","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Colon Cancer","Laparoscopic resection vs open resection of colon cancer","Prospective randomised multicentred controlled trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207815,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["3 & 5 Year Survival following resection of colon cancer","Colon Cancer","Disease free interval following resection of colon cancer","Port-site metastases in laparoscopic resection of colon ca","Safety of Laparoscopic vs Open Ca Resection"],"scientific_title":"AUSTRALASIAN MULTICENTRED PROSPECTIVE RANDOMISED STUDY OF LAPAROSCOPIC VS CONVENTIONAL SURGICAL TREATMENT OF COLON CA","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Surgery","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Mr Peter Hewett","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207815","simplified_title":"Australasian Laparoscopic Colon Cancer - Study (ALCCaS)","sub_type":"Clinical Trial/Large Scale","total_budget":"495000","source_system":"Colon cancer is one of the most common solid tumours in western society. The usual initial treatment is excision of the cancer by an operation done through a cut down the midline of the abdominal wall. Over the past 10 years, minimally invasive technology has changed the approach to many surgical operations. A good example of this is an operation to remove the gall bladder. This is now routinely done using a laparoscope (telescope) which is introduced at the umbilicus. An image on a video screen of the gall bladder is then used to guide instruments to remove the gall bladder without making a large incision in the abdominal wall. This is called a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety of a laparoscopic assisted approach in the removal of colon cancer is yet to be determined. This study will compare the long term and short term outcomes of people who have colon cancers removed either by a laparotomy (a cut in the midline of the abdominal wall) or by a laparoscopic assisted approach (telescope)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Paul Mcmurrick","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044204","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Mcmurrick","source_individual_id":"5023197","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Paul Mcmurrick"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88456","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Philip Bagshaw","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040896","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Bagshaw","source_individual_id":"RMIS1057069","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Philip Bagshaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87608","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Solomon","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033943","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Solomon","source_individual_id":"5012314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Solomon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85788","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Hewett","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031286","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hewett","source_individual_id":"5015227","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Hewett"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85099","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Stevenson","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028170","middle_name":"R L","last_name":"Stevenson","source_individual_id":"RMIS549264","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Stevenson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84273","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Nicholas Rieger","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009906","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Rieger","source_individual_id":"RMIS549261","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Nicholas Rieger"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79388","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3296","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Adult consequences of childhood exposure to psychological trauma","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Adult Psychological Health","Disaster","HPA Axis Functioning","Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","Vulnerability Factors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207813,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Developmental Factors","Epidemiology","Posttraumatic Stress Disorder","Stress Response"],"scientific_title":"Adult consequences of childhood exposure to psychological trauma","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Alexander McFarlane","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207813","simplified_title":"Long-term effects of a disaster","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"292530","source_system":"The importance of childhood experience to adult adjustment (DOES THIS MAKE SENSE) is an issue of general public health interest.

More recently there has been debate on the accuracy with which adults areable to remember traumatic experiences in childhood. This study will follow a group of 808 primary school children who were exposed to the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires in SOuth Australia. They were involved in a study which examined them two months, eight months and twenty six months after the disaster. This rich descriptive set of information about these children and their families forms an objective data base against which their adult recall of the experience can be judged. The symptoms of these children were also documented at the time as was their disaster exposure. The impact of this one event, in the context of the other developmental influences will be examined as determinants of their adjustment in adult life. Finally, there has been an increasing interest in the way that previous traumatic exposure influences the nature of the hormonal response to stress. Using a test of functioning of the cortisol system, the stress response of this population will be compared with a control population who were also studied at the time of the original disaster."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Sawyer","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045279","middle_name":"Gifford","last_name":"Sawyer","source_individual_id":"RMIS26114","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Sawyer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88717","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alexander Mcfarlane","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009011","middle_name":"Cowell","last_name":"Mcfarlane","source_individual_id":"RMIS2293440","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alexander Mcfarlane"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79146","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3295","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Store-operated calcium channels and liver function","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Hepatocytes","Intracellular calcium","Ion channels","Patch clamping"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207812,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Choleostasis","Diabetes","Hepatotoxicity","Liver transplantation"],"scientific_title":"Store-operated calcium channels and liver function","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Grigori Rychkov","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207812","simplified_title":"Calcium signalling in liver","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"241477.6","source_system":"The liver is responsible for regulating the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids , the synthesis of proteins responsible for the transport of lipids in the blood, the synthesis of bile required for fat digestion, and for the removal of toxic chemicals from the body.

This involves the increase of proteins which promote growth and cell division and the decrease in proteins which inhibit growth and cell division. Loss of function may also occur in proteins that are normally involved in killing the cell when growth becomes uncontrolled. Many of these proteins interact with one another and in so doing establish pathways and networks of control which must be perturbed and overridden in the cancer cell. Sometimes this is because the role of the protein is altered in the cancer cell compared to what it normally is in a normal cell. The main aim of this study is to understand the role that is played by a set of proteins that are coded by a single gene. This gene (which we refer to as the FOR gene) spans a region of the human genome which is sensitive to a particular type of mutation. This mutation takes place early in tumour development and therefore we believe that it has important role to play in determining the fate of the cell - helping to cause it to become a tumour cell. We will find out which other proteins in the cell the FOR proteins interact with. Where these proteins are known then this will help determine the pathways in the cell in which the FOR proteins participate. In another approach we will establish animal models (in mice and flies) of mutations in the FOR genes of these species. The transgenic mice will help us find out whether the mutations that we have observed in the FOR gene in various human cancers cause increased sensitivity to mutagens and in so doing aid in transforming normal cells into cancer cells. The transgenic flies will help us identify the metabolic pathways in which the FOR proteins participate. These studies will help understand the roles of the FOR proteins and their significance in cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Richards","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039318","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Richards","source_individual_id":"5017175","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Richards"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87191","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3293","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The effectiveness of consuming fluoridated water in reducing children's caries experience.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Caries Prevention","Dental Caries","Diet","Oral Epidemiology","Water Fluoridation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207806,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Cavities","Dental Caries","Dental Restorations"],"scientific_title":"The effectiveness of consuming fluoridated water in reducing children's caries experience.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew John Spencer","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207806","simplified_title":"The role of fluoridated water in reducing tooth decay in children","sub_type":"Epidemiology","total_budget":"507090","source_system":"The extent to which water fluoridation has contributed to the considerable reduction of dental decay in children in recent times in Australia is unclear, due perhaps to the increasing availability of fluoride in other sources such as toothpaste, drops, tablets, and professional applications.

The economic and social cost of head injury to the community is enormous with billions of dollars spent each year on the management and rehabilitation of trauma patients. Despite the enormity of this public health problem, no effective treatment currently exists. A number of studies have demonstrated that much of the morbidity following TBI is associated with the development of a secondary injury process that occurs between hours to days after the insult. This delayed progression of injury suggests that appropriate pharmacologic intervention can prevent, or at least attenuate, this secondary injury process with a resultant improvement in outcome. Over the past 15 years, a number of groups, including ours, have been investigating the secondary mechanisms associated with the development of functional deficits after TBI. Our previous studies have demonstrated that decline in brain free magnesium is associated with functional deficits after experimental brain injury, and that magnesium administration after injury can improve outcome. Magnesium is now on clinical trial as a pharmacologic intervention. Recent studies have suggested that magnesium decline facilitates neurogenic inflammation, which has been associated with oedema formation, oxidative damage and cell death. Although a number of neuropeptides have been implicated in this process, it is thought that substance P release is closely associated with these pathophysiological processes. Therefore, inhibiting neuropeptide release, or inhibiting substance P binding, may offer a novel therapeutic approach for the attenuation of oedema and development of neurologic deficits after TBI. This proposal will use a combined biochemical, pharmacologic and behavioural approach to characterise the role of neuropeptides in brain trauma, and attempt to develop a novel therapy for use in clinical trauma."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Vink","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0046032","middle_name":"","last_name":"Vink","source_individual_id":"5018118","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Vink"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88913","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Nimmo","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044550","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Nimmo","source_individual_id":"RMIS132067","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alan Nimmo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88537","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Faden","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001488","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Faden","source_individual_id":"RMIS996536","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alan Faden"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77077","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3290","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Parenting style as a mediator of psychosocial risk factors and childhood externalizing behaviour problems","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Externalising Behaviour Problems","Family Risk Factors","Parent Management Strategies","Preschool Children"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207780,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Early Childhood","Externalising Behaviour Problems","Preschool Children"],"scientific_title":"Parenting style as a mediator of psychosocial risk factors and childhood externalizing behaviour problems","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Sawyer","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207780","simplified_title":"Parenting style as a mediator of psychosocial risk factors and childhood externalizing behaviour problems","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"113160","source_system":"It is imperative that effective interventions be developed and evaluated for children with externalising disorders (e.g. oppositional disorder, attention deficit order and conduct disorder).

Childhood externalising problems are also one of the most costly behavioural disorders for society. Many studies have examined the nature and course of externalising problems in older children and adolescents. However, little attention has been paid to the early onset of externalising disorders amongst preschool and early school-age children. Whilst the relationships between family risk factors (e.g. marital discord and maternal depression), parental management styles and children's behaviour problems are widely recognised, the exact nature and direction of these relationships remains largely unknown. This proposal will provide new information about the mechanism through which family risk factors such as marital discord or parental distress influence the onset and persistence of externalising problems in young children, via their effects on parents' behaviour management techniques.

The brain needs constant inputs from sensory receptors in and around the mouth to control these muscles. We will investigate how these sensory mechanisms automatically fine-tune the activity of the jaw muscles and the mechanisms that keep the jaw in its normal position when the subject is sitting quietly, or when the head is moving up and down during running. This normal rest position of the jaw is a vital point of reference for dentists who are making false teeth and for surgeons who are restoring damaged faces, but it is not known what mechanisms are responsible for it. Anyone who has experienced a sore tooth or sore jaw muscles will know that pain adversely affects normal chewing. A common symptom is limitation of jaw movements. We will determine how pain affects the control of jaw muscles. This is important for people with chronic facial pain from arthritis of the jaw joint or from grinding their teeth while they are asleep. Even if it is not possible to eliminate their pain, we hope to suggest approaches which will alleviate its effects. Another part of our study involves a computer model of the chewing system. Computer models enable scientists to examine the effect of various interventions such as surgery or orthodontics on a model before these are tried on humans.

The 11-year follow-up data collection will build upon the previous study findings to provide important and new information about the onset and progression of oral diseases in older Australians. It will also assist with the identification of general health and other characteristics (socio-demographic, medical, functional, cognitive, nutritional, swallowing, dental history, oral hygiene care, financial, social support and oral disorder social impact characteristics) that are associated with oral diseases in various groups of older adults. Groups of older adults within the study include those who are healthy and living in the community, those who are frail and use support services, and those who have moved into residential care. This information will assist both private and public health sectors, dental professionals and other health professionals with the identification of those older adults who are at high risk for developing oral diseases, such as those with dementia, those with physical disabilities, and those living in residential care.

A western diet, ie. one high in animal fat, or saturated fats, may be to blame. Human epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of a diet high in saturated fats is correlated with a propensity to arrhythmias while a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can confer protection from coronary heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. The contraction of the heart depends on changes in calcium inside the individual muscle cells. Abnormalities of the way calcium is handled in the cells leads to abnormalities of contraction and to a certain types of arrhythmia. Over the last 5 to 10 years, technological developments have enabled us to examine changes in calcium in living heart cells at microscopic level. It is possible to fill individual living cells with a fluorescent dye which changes either the magnitude or the wavelength of its fluorescence according to the ambient calcium concentration. Cells filled with these dyes are examined with a laser scanning confocal microscope, in which a very tightly focussed laser beam excites the dye and the resulting fluorescence is gathered by a computer controlled image analysis system. In this way we can measure the calcium concentration within the cells with a spatial resolution of about 1-1000 of a millimetre, and a time resolution of about 1-100 of a second. Using these techniques, we have found that supplementing the diet of rats with either PUFAs or saturated fats produces a dramatic change in the way that calcium is stored and released in their heart cells. This effect of dietary fats has not been reported before, and it may represent an important clue as to how these substances protect against many cardiac arrhythmias."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Saint","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033585","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Saint","source_individual_id":"RMIS5653","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Saint"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85694","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3286","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Understanding the role of chemokine receptor modulation in T cell trafficking","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Chemokines","Immunity","T lymphocytes"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207768,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Autoimmunity","Immune deficiency","Inflammation"],"scientific_title":"Understanding the role of chemokine receptor modulation in T cell trafficking","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Shaun McColl","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207768","simplified_title":"Chemokine receptors and T cell trafficking","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"391650","source_system":"This research will begin to determine the significance of changes in the amount of recently-discovered proteins on the surface of cells called T lymphocytes.

In some cases the persistent production of elevated amounts of these molecules leads to highly crippling and debilitating diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis, which pose a huge burden to our community. To develop medication to combat these diseases be it either vaccination or antiinflammatory drugs, there is a need to clearly define key components of the inflammatory response. Since TNF acts through a receptor we propose that a critical issue in the regulation of this inflammatory response is the changes in the expression of these receptors on cells of the immune system. Our preliminary work suggests that lipid molecules such as arachidonic acid (omega-6 fat) interacts with phagocytic cells and causes drammatic changes to the expression of this receptor. Our research proposal will look at this in more detail and place the observation into perspective in terms of parameters of the inflammatory reaction and associated diseases. Furthermore this concept will be examined in relation to the protective effects which the omega-3 fats found in fish oil have on these inflammatory diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Charles Hii","data":{"first_name":"Charles","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037263","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Hii","source_individual_id":"RMIS36906","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Charles Hii"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86656","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Antonio Ferrante","data":{"first_name":"Antonio","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030662","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ferrante","source_individual_id":"RMIS36909","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Antonio Ferrante"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84969","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3284","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Phase shifting endocrine and sleep/activity rhythms with light and serotonergic drugs","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Circadian rhythm","Hypothalamus","Melatonin","Neuroendocrinology","Serotonin"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207762,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Sleep onset insomnia","endocrinology","neuroendocrinology","neuropharmacology"],"scientific_title":"Phase shifting endocrine and sleep/activity rhythms with light and serotonergic drugs","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr David Kennaway","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207762","simplified_title":"Shifting biological rhythms with drugs","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"561430","source_system":"All biological systems, including those of humans, are influenced by changes in the environment, especially by variations in the amount of daylight.

The SCN in turn orchestrates rhythms in the secretion of the hormone melatonin from the pineal gland, body temperature, the timing of sleep and the secretion of other hormones. The aim of this study is to extend our knowledge of the inter-relationships between light, the chemical messengers that nerves use to communicate with each other, the biological clock and rhythms in body functions. We will concentrate on one particular chemical messenger called serotonin which we believe plays an important role in keeping rhythms in synchrony with the natural day-night cycle.

However, it is also known that not all of the blood cholesterol is bad. If it is carried in particles called low density lipoproteins or LDLs it causes heart disease. But if it is carried in other particles known as high density lipoproteins or HDLs it does not. In fact, it is now well known that HDLs actually protect against the development of coronary heart disease. There are two main actions of HDLs that contribute to their ability to protect. Firstly, they are known to drain cholesterol out of coronary arteries. We have recently shown that they have a second action. The end result of this second action is a slowing down of the entry into coronary arteries of cells called monocytes that are necessary for the development of the atherosclerosis that causes the heart disease. This project is concerned with this ability of HDLs to slow down the development of atherosclerosis by the second action. We have found that this second action of HDLs is influenced by the type of fats they carry. We propose now to investigate the mechanism by which different fats influence this action of HDLs with a view to devising new strategies for the prevention of heart disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kerry-Anne Rye","data":{"first_name":"Kerry-Anne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021885","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rye","source_individual_id":"RMIS5348768","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Kerry-Anne Rye"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82632","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Barter","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017608","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Barter","source_individual_id":"5013356","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Philip Barter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81496","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Paul Baker","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0000202","middle_name":"","last_name":"Baker","source_individual_id":"RMIS679198","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Paul Baker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76712","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3279","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Ablative therapies for Barrett's Oesophagus - evaluation of new clinical and experimental therapies","data":{"media_summary":"lower oesophageal adenocarcinoma","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Barrett's oesophagus","antireflux surgery","cancer","gastro-oesophageal reflux disease","randomised controlled trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207740,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["assessment of surgical procedures and medical technology","cancer of the oesophagus","cancer prevention","gastro-oesophageal reflux","lower oesophageal adenocarcinoma"],"scientific_title":"Ablative therapies for Barrett's Oesophagus - evaluation of new clinical and experimental therapies","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Surgery","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Watson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207740","simplified_title":"Ablation of Barrett's Oesophagus","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"302310","source_system":"Barrett's oesophagus arises when repeated episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux lead to the oesophageal lining undergoing change to a lining more like that of the intestine. This new lining predisposes to cancer, a problem which is rapidly becoming more common. Recent research has focused on techniques which could reverse this process. Destruction (ablation) of Barrett s oesophagus can be followed by regeneration with a normal looking lining. A range of techniques have been used for this. However, the behavior of the regenerated lining is unknown, and there still remains potential for cancer. We are currently evaluating endoscopic ablation using Argon Plasma Coagulation within clinical trials. There is also scope for the development of better approaches to ablation. We hypothesize that an suitable liquid has the potential to more evenly and more easily ablate the lining. Delivery of a liquid substance to lower oesophagus can be achieved through a tube which confines liquid to the lower oesophagus. However, to make this approach acceptable it is necessary to determine the best treatment agent, and to test the delivery system. We will first do this using animal models, before future application in patients. A further key issue is whether the cells which repopulate the oesophagus are genetically normal or abnormal. After ablation it is likely that the cells which repopulate the lining are sourced from the same cells which were the source of the abnormal lining, and these cells could inherit genetic alterations. This could increase the risk of cancer. Hence, we plan to assess certain genes in biopsies taken from tissue before and after ablation to determine genetic normality. In Australia endoscopic ablative techniques are currently being introduced into clinical practice without evaluation. Hence the question of whether ablation actually reduces the risk of cancer and how to best perform ablation should be addressed before clinical application becomes widespread."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Paul Drew","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0036361","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Drew","source_individual_id":"RMIS86747","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Paul Drew"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86421","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Mark Schoeman","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033679","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schoeman","source_individual_id":"RMIS57914","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Mark Schoeman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85719","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glyn Jamieson","data":{"first_name":"Glyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031543","middle_name":"Garfield","last_name":"Jamieson","source_individual_id":"RMIS12565","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Glyn Jamieson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85165","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lorwai Tan","data":{"first_name":"Lorwai","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028289","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tan","source_individual_id":"RMIS987906","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lorwai Tan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84310","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Watson","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022872","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Watson","source_individual_id":"RMIS12562","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Watson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82898","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3278","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"(a) Pathogenesis of aortic stenosis : relationship to valvular endothelial function.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Aortic Valve Stenosis","Endothelial Function","Platelet Aggregation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207736,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Aortic Stenosis","Cardiac Death","Heart Failure"],"scientific_title":"(a) Pathogenesis of aortic stenosis : relationship to valvular endothelial function.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

However, the relative decline in the frequency of premature death due to coronary disease (such as heart attacks) combined with increases in longevity, will see the emergence of new disease states. Aortic stenosis (AS) is likely to be one of the most important of these: progressive aortic valvular narrowing, culminating in the development of heart failure, and cardiac death. To date, the only established treatment for severe AS is valve replacement. The incidence of AS increases with age: approximately 40% of individuals over the age of 80 have some AS, while 4% have severe AS. Studies to date have revealed that AS is more likely to occur (and to progress rapidly) in patients with impaired kidney function, and that some coronary risk factors (high cholesterol levels and diabetes, for example) also predispose to AS. The planned research will examine the potential role of the (endothelial) cells lining the aortic valve in protecting against the development of AS. In particular, we will try to identify which chemicals interfere with endothelial function, and how this leads to thickening of the valve. The ulitmate objective of this research is to delineate the chemical factors causing AS, in order to help in the development of preventative strategies for this disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Yuliy Chirkov","data":{"first_name":"Yuliy","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041603","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chirkov","source_individual_id":"RMIS198101","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Yuliy Chirkov"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87799","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Margaret Arstall","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035146","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Arstall","source_individual_id":"RMIS207089","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Margaret Arstall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86111","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Macdonald","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032242","middle_name":"Simon","last_name":"Macdonald","source_individual_id":"RMIS219000","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Macdonald"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jennifer Kennedy","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020071","middle_name":"Ann","last_name":"Kennedy","source_individual_id":"RMIS86237","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jennifer Kennedy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82117","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Horowitz","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019704","middle_name":"David","last_name":"Horowitz","source_individual_id":"5015326","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Horowitz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82020","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3277","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["Jaw movement","Musculoskeletal pain","Neural reflexes","Sensorimotor control","Synaptic mechanisms"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207730,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dentistry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"A/Pr Kemal Turker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207730","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"677000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Kemal Turker","data":{"first_name":"Kemal","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0045934","middle_name":"","last_name":"Turker","source_individual_id":"RMIS24245","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Kemal Turker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88889","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3276","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Control of mastication by periodontal mechanoreceptors in man","data":{"media_summary":"temporomandibular disorders","end_year":2004,"keywords":["jaw movement","neural reflexes","sensorimotor control","synaptic mechanisms","temporomandibular disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207729,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["health related to ageing (tooth loss)","jaw dysfunction","jaw joint pain","musculoskeletal disorders","temporomandibular disorders"],"scientific_title":"Control of mastication by periodontal mechanoreceptors in man","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dentistry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"A/Pr Kemal Turker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207729","simplified_title":"Control of chewing in man.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"169990","source_system":"Despite the importance in chewing and speech, very little is known regarding the fine control of jaw muscles. A thorough understanding of the control of the jaw muscles is at the base of improved diagnosis and treatment of many chewing disorders. For example: We still do not understand the causes of the jaw muscle-joint pain disorder (temporomandibular dysfunction) which accounts for about 5 % of total dental patients. The current treatments, including pain killers, night plates and massage cure only about half of all patients. Improved diagnosis and treatment techniques require more precise elaboration of the neural and muscular mechanisms of chewing. Why do the chewing forces in toothless individuals, despite well fitting dentures, fall to about 20 % of the value in teethed individuals? Do jaw muscles in these subjects weaken because they get less feedback from the receptors around the teeth? How does the chewing force automatically adjust to overcome sudden or gradual changes in the characteristics of foodstuff? Although bite to bite changes in the chewing force is observed in subjects with natural teeth, no such changes occur in toothless subjects or subjects chewing with implanted bridges. How do the receptors adjust the activation of jaw muscles so that bite force is applied in the right direction and right amount at each bite? The aim of this study is to define the importance of the periodontal mechanoreceptors (tiny nerve cells that are situated between the roots of the teeth and the jaw bone that signal bite force to the brain) in the control of jaw muscles. This study will, therefore, illustrate the importance of keeping the teeth and gums healthy for the development of strong, smooth and well-controlled chewing forces, and potentially create opportunities to improve chewing (and thereby quality of life) in toothless individuals or those experiencing other difficulties in chewing."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Kemal

developing countries. The high morbidity and mortality associated with pneumococcal disease is also being exacerbated by the rate at which this organism is acquiring resistance to multiple antibiotics. Existing pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in young children and only provide cover against a limited range of serotypes. Serotype coverage is even lower in the more immunogenic conjugate vaccines currently being developed; these will also be very expensive, thereby limiting their use in developing countries, where the need for effective paediatric vaccines is greatest. Pneumococci produce a variety of proteins which are important in causing disease, but the relative contribution of these factors at each stage of the infection process remain to be determined. Moreover, virtually nothing is known of the mechanism whereby these virulence factors are regulated in response to the external environment of the bacterium. In view of this, we are conducting a comprehensive examination of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease, with particular reference to the role of putative virulence proteins.

In a proportion of cases, this leads to potentially fatal systemic complications, such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which is the commonest cause of acute renal failure in children. HUS has a high mortality rate in spite of intensive supportive therapy. Morbidity is also substantial, as permanent renal damage and neurological sequelae occur in a significant proportion of survivors. Large outbreaks of STEC infection are becoming increasingly common, and highlight the threat to public health posed by these bacteria. The serious systemic complications of STEC disease, as well as much of the intestinal pathology, are directly attributable to Stx. However, pathogenesis is multifactorial and capacity of the bacteria to colonize the gut is a crucial virulence trait. STEC infections can now be diagnosed very early in the course of disease, but currently no effective therapeutic intervention is possible. We are addressing this deficiency by developing a novel therapy for STEC infections based on a genetically modified harmless bacterium capable of binding toxin in the gut. Vaccines capable of preventing transmission of STEC disease in the community are also needed, but development of these demands a full understanding of the mechanisms whereby diverse STEC strains adhere to intestinal epithelium and colonize the human gut. We are therefore also examining the interaction between STEC and gut epithelial cells at the cellular and molecular level, with a view to identifying and assessing the vaccine potential of key determinants of adherence."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Paton","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027246","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Paton","source_individual_id":"RMIS7494","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Paton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84042","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Adrienne Paton","data":{"first_name":"Adrienne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009565","middle_name":"Webster","last_name":"Paton","source_individual_id":"RMIS365361","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Adrienne Paton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79299","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3272","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Modelling traumatic brain injury using neuropsychological, neurosurgical, neurochemical, and neuroradiological measures","data":{"media_summary":"quantitative MRI volume loss","end_year":2004,"keywords":["S100 protein","cognition","public health","traumatic brain injury - adults","volumetric magnetic resonance imaging"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207711,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["acquired brain injury - adults","information processing difficulties","neuropsychological impairments","public health","quantitative MRI volume loss"],"scientific_title":"Modelling traumatic brain injury using neuropsychological, neurosurgical, neurochemical, and neuroradiological measures","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Jane Mathias","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207711","simplified_title":"Modelling the effects of brain damage following traumatic brain injury","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"403370","source_system":"Post mortem and brain imaging studies of patients who have had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) indicate that they sustain both focal damage and widespread diffuse damage. This diffuse damage is more difficult to detect but has been found to occur even after mild injuries and in the absence of focal brain damage. Moreover, diffuse damage is thought to contribute both to changes in a patient's level of consciousness at the time of injury and to the long-term problems experienced by patients after a TBI, suggesting that diffuse damage may provide a valuable index of the amount of brain damage that has been sustained as a result of an injury. While clinicians presently assess many cognitive abilities, they do not target the cognitive problems that are thought to arise from diffuse damage. This is largely due to an absence of validated measures and a limited understanding of the effects of diffuse damage on cognitive functioning. Consequently, we do not have a clear understanding of the extent to which diffuse damage contributes to patient outcome after a TBI. The present study is designed to provide a model of the effects of TBI that will include neuropsychological, neurosurgical, neurochemical and neuroradiological variables. The cognitive effects of diffuse damage will be assessed and related to neurochemical and brain imaging indices of diffuse damage in order to examine the relationship between brain structure and function. This study will improve our understanding of the effects of diffuse damage on cognitive functioning and will lead to the development of measures that can be used to assess the consequences of diffuse damage. In doing so, this study will improve the accuracy with which we are able to diagnose the cognitive problems of patients who have suffered a TBI. This will, in turn, reduce the public health, insurance and litigation costs associated with this type of injury."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Nigel Jones","data":{"first_name":"Nigel","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0043354","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jones","source_individual_id":"RMIS11117","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Nigel Jones"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88232","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephen Bowden","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023721","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Bowden","source_individual_id":"RMIS15123","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephen Bowden"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83091","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jane Mathias","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020676","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Mathias","source_individual_id":"5016239","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jane Mathias"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82284","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Erin Bigler","data":{"first_name":"Erin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017738","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Bigler","source_individual_id":"5013478","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Erin Bigler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81531","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Dianne Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Dianne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010577","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS366549","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Dianne Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79575","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3271","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Clinical pharmacology of methadone during induction onto maintenance treatment.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["hypoxia","methadone","opioid dependence","pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207710,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["adverse treatment effects","dose individualisation","drug metabolism","methadone maintenance/poisoning"],"scientific_title":"Clinical pharmacology of methadone during induction onto maintenance treatment.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Jason White","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207710","simplified_title":"Safe induction onto methadone.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"422310","source_system":"Heroin addiction can be very successfully treated by substituting heroin with methadone.

Delineating the molecular basis of the regulation of ENaC is vital in understanding disease mechanisms and in defining targets for novel therapeutics for the treatment of disorders that arise due to sodium imbalance. Furthermore, ENaC and the molecules involved in the channel regulatory cascade are potential candidate genes in defining the genetic causes of human hypertension and salt wasting disorders. Previous studies from our laboratories and by other groups have implicated Nedd4, a protein initially cloned by us, as a key player in regulating ENaC. Our recent data suggest that KIAA0439, a close relative of Nedd4, is also involved in ENaC control mechanisms.

On average a woman's last 9 years are disability years (ie in the care of others), with a reduction in quality of life and at great cost to the community. The main causes of disability are cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, dementia and incontinence, which may all be influenced by a lack of oestrogen in the post-menopausal years when the ovaries produce no more oestrogen. Does long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduce these problems and increase the quality of life? Does HRT promote adverse effects eg. breast cancer, blood clots? Do some women benefit more than others? Are some women more at risk? What is the overall cost of HRT to the individual and the community? Do women without a uterus require just oestrogen alone or an added hormone, progestogen? These questions can never be answered without a large long-term prospective randomised placebo controlled trial, as all current non-randomised studies are open to major biases due to inequalities in the study groups through selection, healthy user effects etc. As HRT is a potential option for all women and its potential influence on many major diseases may be great both through benefit and harm, it is essential to conduct such a trial. Its size and cost requires international collaboration and Australia seeks up to 2000 volunteers to join a trial of up to 36,000 women around the world. They will take HRT or placebo for 10 years with close monitoring and medical checks, and their health records will be checked for a further 10 years.

The process of bone remodelling is fundamental for the maintenance of skeletal integrity. Our understanding of the molecular signalling involved in activating bone remodelling is principally derived from tissue culture and animal experiments. We will study human cancellous bone samples donated by patients undergoing surgery, and with the consent of the next-of-kin, taken at autopsy. These molecular and histomorphometric studies will determine whether the understanding derived from tissue culture and animal experiments is consistent with associations demonstrable in the human cancellous bone microenvironment. The elucidation of the molecular signalling in the human bone microenvironment is essential for the effective diagnosis and treatment of bone disease. Recently reported studies have shown very persuasively that fatigue microdamage accumulates in the skeleton and is targeted for repair by remodelling. Our preliminary data shows that microcrack length is positively correlated with IL-11 mRNA gene expression. We will further investigate mRNA gene expression of a number of cytokines involved in bone cell signalling and their association with the level of microdamage in the bone. Using a animal model of controlled bone microdamage induction we will seek to determine the bone remodelling causal relationship between microdamage and cytokine signalling. Furthermore, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to trabecular structures are not well understood. These studies will provide new insight into the processes that determine trabecular structures. This project will investigate these mechanisms and increase our understanding of bone cell function, essential for diagnosis and design of rational treatment for bone diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Martin","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038318","middle_name":"Bruce","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS1022314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86925","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Forwood","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007324","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Forwood","source_individual_id":"RMIS18701","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Forwood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78676","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari","data":{"first_name":"Nicola (Nick)","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007214","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Fazzalari","source_individual_id":"RMIS5831069","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78651","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3266","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Elastic fibre-matrix interactions important for tissue development, morphology and function","data":{"media_summary":"skeletal disease","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Extracellular matrix","collagen","elastin","matrix proteins","proteoglycans"],"nhmrc_grant_id":207700,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["aneurysm rupture","atherosclerosis","congenital disorders","lower respiratory tract disease","skeletal disease"],"scientific_title":"Elastic fibre-matrix interactions important for tissue development, morphology and function","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Mark Gibson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/207700","simplified_title":"Structural protein interactions essential for function of arteries, lung and skin","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"376980","source_system":"The properties of many tissues are controlled by the type, ratio and organisation of structural proteins laid down into extracellular matrices.

Although there have been improvements in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, many men are still diagnosed with disease that already has or will spread to other sites such as lymph nodes and bone (ie metastatic disease). For those men with metastatic disease, reduction in testicular androgens by surgical or medical means (ie androgen ablation) is the only effective treatment option available. However, androgen ablation is only palliative, and treatment failure is common, with less than 20% of patients surviving more than 5 years. Recent evidence suggests that the androgen receptor, which mediates the growth regulatory effects of androgens, such as testosterone, is often defective in prostate tumour cells. These altered or mutant receptors may be inappropriately activated and stimulate tumour growth which may explain why treatment fails in a subset of men with advanced prostate cancer. The major objective of our current proposal is to evaluate a novel approach for the treatment of prostate cancer which, based upon our preliminary results, has the potential to be effective even if alterations are present in the androgen receptor. Specifically, we will examine the effectiveness of derivatives of a natural product, the antibiotic geldanamycin, to inhibit prostate tumour growth. The current studies therefore have the potential to result in improved treatment approaches for advanced prostate cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Wayne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028408","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS102344","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wayne Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Villis Marshall","data":{"first_name":"Villis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026522","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Marshall","source_individual_id":"5030803","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Villis Marshall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83856","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3053","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"development and commercialisation of a product for repairing photodamage in skin","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["biotechnology","growth factors","skin disorders","skin photodamage","topical pharmaceutical"],"nhmrc_grant_id":144702,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"development and commercialisation of a product for repairing photodamage in skin","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dermatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Timothy Rayner","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/144702","simplified_title":"development and commercialisation of a product for repairing photodamage in skin","sub_type":"Industry ECF","total_budget":"346250","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Timothy Rayner","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0021637","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rayner","source_individual_id":"RMIS377091","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Timothy Rayner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82568","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2984","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Ongoing Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"nhmrc_grant_id":160084,"application_year":2000,"start_year":2001,"scientific_title":"Ongoing Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"","cia_name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160084","simplified_title":"Ongoing Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"458385.39","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers","data":{"first_name":"Raymond","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027648","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Rodgers","source_individual_id":"5017235","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Raymond Rodgers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84138","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2845","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Androgen-regulated proteins: predictors of prostate cancer development and progression","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Androgen receptors","Androgen responsive proteins","Disease progression and prognosis","Prostate cancer"],"nhmrc_grant_id":160055,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Diagnosis","Disease outcome","Early stage prostate cancer","Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)"],"scientific_title":"Androgen-regulated proteins: predictors of prostate cancer development and progression","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Catherine Choong","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/160055","simplified_title":"Proteins regulated by male sex hormones predict development and progression of prostate cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"391073.44","source_system":"Use of PSA (prostate specific antigen) levels in blood to screen for prostate cancer has resulted in a) earlier detection of tumours and b) increased diagnosis of a premalignant disease of the prostate called PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). PIN is thought to progressively change into cancer, which can invade the rest of the body. Growth of the cells of the prostate is regulated by male hormones called androgens. Small cancers localised to the prostate grow in response to androgens, but larger cancers which have spread from the prostate grow steadily even after the androgen supply is cut off by removal of the testicles. In this project we will examine changes in the level of various proteins in the prostate, which are known to be produced in response to androgen, to see whether they discriminate: 1) those patients with PIN who will go on to develop prostate cancer, 2) those patients with small cancers within the prostate who progress to widespread cancer. We also propose to use a laser-controlled dissecting microscope to obtain pure populations of cancer cells from prostate tissues and then to isolate their DNA in order to: a) examine the DNA sequence of the protein which controls cellular growth in response to androgen (ie the androgen receptor) to see whether undesirable changes (mutations) have occurred in its structure during the development of the cancer, and b) identify proteins which mediate the effects of the androgen regulated proteins and control cancer development or spread. This will be done using the revolutionary technique of gene microarrays, where partial DNA sequences of approximately 4,000 different prostate genes are spotted onto small membrane filters, and which enable identification of genes that change in level with the onset of cancer and cancer spread. These 2 objectives will, in the case of a) prevent inappropriate treatment for prostate cancer, and b) identify targets for new treatments and for chemoprevention."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wayne

adult diseases such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity, are related to weight and size at birth. It appears that genetic and environmental factors interact during pregnancy to determine the growth rate of the embryo and fetus and result in a permanent programming of the development of fetal organs and tissues which may result in the onset of disease in adult life. It is well established that babies born to mothers who develop diabetes in pregnancy are bigger at birth and are at greater risk of developing obesity in childhood. Paradoxically several major studies of human populations exposed to deprivation during pregnancy have shown that children born to mothers who experience undernutrition in pregnancy may also develop obesity in adult life. A new hormone has recently been identified which acts as a signal of fat mass and which plays a major role in the regulation of body weight and energy expenditure in the adult. We propose to define the role of this hormone before birth and to determine whether its production or action is altered by an increase or a decrease in fetal nutrition. In particular, we will investigate whether perturbations in the metabolic environment of the fetus program an increased production of this hormone or resistance to its actions after birth. These studies will increase our understanding of what adaptive changes before birth may relate to an increased likelihood of obesity after birth."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Phillip Owens","data":{"first_name":"Phillip","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0015398","middle_name":"","last_name":"Owens","source_individual_id":"RMIS1022607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Phillip Owens"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80885","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Caroline Mcmillen","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003342","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Mcmillen","source_individual_id":"RMIS118499","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Caroline Mcmillen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77587","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2791","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Dental service utilisation in young adults: a function of need, health behaviours or socio-demographic variables?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["dental health surveys","dental service utilisation","epidemiology","public health","young adults"],"nhmrc_grant_id":158027,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Access to dental care","Health behaviours","Oral health"],"scientific_title":"Dental service utilisation in young adults: a function of need, health behaviours or socio-demographic variables?","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dentistry not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"A/Pr Kaye Roberts-Thomson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/158027","simplified_title":"Use of dental services by young adults - what helps and what hinders?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"58190","source_system":"Over the past 20 years there have been significant gains made in the oral health of children, with the majority of 12 year olds in Australia in 1996 having no dental decay.

In 1998-99 a baseline study was conducted on a sample of Adelaide young adults 20-24 years using telephone interviews and oral examinations. Data was obtained on dental visiting patterns, socio-economic status, living arrangements, and health behaviours such as smoking and playing sport, as well as oral health. This study seeks to follow-up the sample of 1265 young adults who were interviewed in 1998-99 to ascertain any changes in oral health and utilisation of dental services. Data on socio-economic status, living arrangements and health behaviours will also be collected to determine whether any changes in those factors may explain changes in visiting behaviour and oral health. In addition participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on satisfaction with dental care. Permission will be sought to gain access to participants School Dental Service records to determine whether any relationship exists between childhood visiting patterns and those in adulthood. This study will enable identification of the factors which affect oral health and dental utilisation in young adults to assist in the development of oral health promotion strategies to encourage timely, effective and appropriate dental service utilisation and preventive behaviours.

DHBV-infected ducks will be treated with a new and extremely potent antiviral drug Entacavir (ETV; Bristol-Myers Squibb). Drug treatment will be combined with various DNA vaccination protocols, including new strategies that involve DNA vaccine priming and recombinant fowlpoxvirus (rFPV) boosting of immune responses. Inoculation of DNA vaccines and rFPV results in expression of viral proteins that are presented to the immune system and evoke strong immune responses. 'Prime boost' protocols with DNA vaccines and rFPV have shown promise for protection against and treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (AIDS virus) infection. We will assess the effect of treatment by measuring levels of DHBV in liver and blood, clearance of infected cells and serological changes.

Acute HBV infection can produce extreme variation in disease, ranging from asymptomatic infection, to acute transient hepatitis with jaundice, or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver failure (Hollinger, 1996). The identification of viral genes that affect the severity of disease is a major current goal in medical virology. For example, there is considerable interest in identifying the genes of the influenza genome responsible for high mortality outbreaks; with the human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS, variants deleted in the nef gene region cause a less rapidly progressing infection and have attracted attention as a possible prototype for an attenuated vaccine. We propose to investigate how the different genes of hepadnaviruses affect the course of infection and type of disease produced. Studies will be performed in ducks infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) as these animals provide the only model system available in Australia. We will study both experimentally and naturally derived DHBV variants to explore the effects of genetic changes on the outcome of infection. This will enhance our understanding of this virus family and will provide models for comparison with HBV infection.

The cause of PCOS is uncertain. Symptoms include menstrual disorders, acne, obesity, and excess body hair. PCOS is of great significance for women because of the high incidence of infertility and the high risk of other serious diseases, including diabetes mellitus and endometrial cancer. PCOS is probably the most common hormonal condition among young women. The cause of PCOS is unknown and the relationship between PCOS and the more common condition of polycystic ovaries, which often features in PCOS, is uncertain. There is evidence that genetic factors contribute to PCOS, but cannot explain certain aspects. There is also striking new evidence that abnormal growth in the womb can alter the metabolism of the baby for life, resulting in increased risks of adult disease, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. PCOS may be another consequence of abnormal fetal growth, a suggestion that is supported by two recent studies of closely related conditions. To investigate the origins of PCOS, we propose to establish the first international study of the relationships between fetal growth, genetic factors and the presence of PCOS. In this study, we shall trace 3,260 women born in one maternity ward during 1973-75. These women, now young adults, will be invited into our study for an interview, physical examination, and a blood test. We expect 2,200 women will participate. Of this group, some 220 women with PCOS will receive further tests to investigate a range of metabolic problems.

Despite major advances, ART continues to be very costly in many regards. A major reason for this is the relatively low rate of pregnancy, which averages 25% per procedure. The common response to the problem of low pregnancy rates is to return several embryos to uterus. A dilemma associated with this strategy is the high risk of multiple pregnancy, which is associated with adverse consequences for mother and fetus(es). Compared to singleton births; fetal, neonatal, and perinatal mortality rates are 3-6 times higher in twins, and 5-15 times higher in multiple births of a higher order. Cerebral palsy rates among survivors are six times higher in twins and twenty times higher in triplets. The increase in the incidence of adverse outcomes related to multiple pregnancy has been well documented in ART. We propose a randomised controlled study to assess single embryo transfer (SET) compared to double embryo transfer (DET). Infertility women with a high risk of multiple pregnancy will be randomly allocated to receive one or two embryos, which is the usual treatment at present. We shall then examine the rates of single and multiple pregnancies, and the success of those pregnancies in this group of patients. Potential benefits to the community from this project are very substantial, as it has the capacity to substantially reduce the number of multiple births.

However, research is essential to develop a procedure which optimizes the outcome for patients undergoing surgical management of reflux, and minimizes the risk of complications. This may provide a better alternative to long term management with acid suppressing medication, and could eventually achieve long term savings to the nation's health budget. Since 1994 research conducted at the Royal Adelaide Hospital has evaluated a range of different key hole operations aimed at improving the outcome for patients undergoing surgery for gastro-oesophageal reflux. Over 100 patients have been entered into each of the following clinical trials: total fundoplication with or without division of the short gastric vessels, total versus anterior partial fundoplication and posterior or anterior hiatal repair. Further trials will compare a lesser degree of anterior partial fundoplication with total fundoplication. A common research protocol has been developed and applied to all of these trials. This involves the use of double blind randomised methodology, with independent follow-up obtained by an independent investigator. These trials will determine the best surgical technique for the surgical correction of reflux, and this should lead to a more widely accepted surgical alternative to existing non-operative strategies for pathological reflux."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glyn Jamieson","data":{"first_name":"Glyn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031543","middle_name":"Garfield","last_name":"Jamieson","source_individual_id":"RMIS12565","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Glyn Jamieson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85165","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Watson","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022872","middle_name":"Ian","last_name":"Watson","source_individual_id":"RMIS12562","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Watson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82898","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2783","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Human osteoclast formation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["T cells and tumour cells","human osteoblasts as osteoclastogenic stroma","human osteoclast co-culture model","human osteoclasts and their progenitors","pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157984,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["cancer-induced osteolysis","orthopaedic osteolysis","osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Human osteoclast formation","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Understanding of the regulation of osteoclast formation and activity has increased greatly in the last few years, but important questions remain. In particular, more information is needed about the process of human osteoclast formation. We have devised a novel cell culture model of human osteoclast formation, in which osteoclast precursor cells mature into osteoclasts under the influence of human osteoblast cells. The importance of this model is that it allows us, for the first time, to investigate the role, and the potential relevance in human disease, of agents that positively and negatively affect osteoclasts. We intend also to use this model to study the way in which cancer cells in bone cause bone loss, as well as the involvement of cells of the immune system in osteoclast formation, in normal bone and in inflammatory conditions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017304","middle_name":"Christopher William","last_name":"Zannettino","source_individual_id":"RMIS362660","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Zannettino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81407","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins","data":{"first_name":"Gerald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005872","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Atkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS228986","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Gerald Atkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78304","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Haynes","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002107","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Haynes","source_individual_id":"RMIS18488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Haynes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77248","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2782","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"CORTICAL CONTROL OF THE FINGERS IN HUMANS","data":{"media_summary":"stroke","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Corticospinal","Digital dexterity","Electromyography (EMG)","Magnetic brain stimulation","Motor cortex"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157975,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Parkinson's disease","hemiplegia","neural mechanisms underlying skilled use of the hand","rehabilitation of motor function","stroke"],"scientific_title":"CORTICAL CONTROL OF THE FINGERS IN HUMANS","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Michael Nordstrom","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157975","simplified_title":"CORTICAL CONTROL OF THE FINGERS IN HUMANS","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196018.36","source_system":"I will use non-invasive brain stimulation to study the operation of the corticospinal pathway in humans while they perform tasks requiring precise control of fingers and thumb.

Therefore, a 'second generation' study is needed which addresses these common design issues in order to establish optimal conditions for the use of dietary omega-3 fats in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The current proposal will address the previous design shortcomings by changing the background diet, measuring functional disability and joint damage as well as symptoms, starting treatment in early disease before joint damage has occurred, and by regulating concurrent drug use. The study will also evaluate a novel blood test that indicates the effect of advice to increase dietary omega-3 fats upon omega-3 nutritional status. If this nutritional index correlates with more favourable outcomes, a base will have been established for guiding treatment with omega-3 fats in routine clinical situations. This study is important because dietary treatment in rheumatoid arthritis: (a) offers sufferers with rheumatoid arthritis a more active role in the life long management of their disease. (b) has no on-going cost to the government health budget, and in fact, has the potential to decrease treatment costs in rheumatoid arthritis considerably (c) has wider applicability, e.g. for prevention and treatment of other inflammatory conditions and heart disease (d) needs to be tested with modern treatment protocols that involve multiple therapies started early in the course of rheumatoid arthritis, before irreversible impairment and disability has occurred (e) requires a nutritional index to guide treatment (f) must be evidence based."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Susanna Proudman","data":{"first_name":"Susanna","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044935","middle_name":"Margaret","last_name":"Proudman","source_individual_id":"RMIS120891","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Susanna Proudman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88634","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael James","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031542","middle_name":"John","last_name":"James","source_individual_id":"RMIS5607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael James"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85164","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Gibson","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019202","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS152063","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81898","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leslie Cleland","data":{"first_name":"Leslie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018309","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Cleland","source_individual_id":"RMIS120886","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leslie Cleland"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81689","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2780","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Roles of Chaperone Proteins and Phosphorylation Events in activity of the Dioxin Receptor","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["environmental pollutants","gene regulation","intracellular receptors","signal transduction","transcription factors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157966,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["environmental pollutants","toxicity","tumour promotion"],"scientific_title":"Roles of Chaperone Proteins and Phosphorylation Events in activity of the Dioxin Receptor","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Murray Whitelaw","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157966","simplified_title":"Toxic mechanisms of the Dioxin Receptor","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"227036.72","source_system":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are prevalent environmental pollutants which cause a wide range of deleterious health effects.

Given the right opportunity, eosinophils can cause damage to some parasites within just a few hours of contact. This is quite a feat because parasitic worms are multicellular organisms which are much larger than eosinophils and which have evolved to live in the presence of active immune responses. To do it's job properly an eosinophil probably makes use of small soluble molecules in the blood and others fixed to it's own cell surface, to recognize the parasite and to promote adhesion to the target. You might like to consider these molecules as hands grabbing onto handles on the surface of the parasite. The more hands there are, the better the grip and some hands grip more strongly than others. We are investigating what these molecules are and how they work. By understanding how eosinophils operate, we may be able to devise ways in which we can make them more effective. We are also trying to understand why some species of parasite are resistant to attack by eosinophils. We think that resistant parasites secrete substances which either block the binding of eosinophils to the parasite surface, or prevent the functioning of eosinophils that do bind. It is possible that these inhibitory substances may even kill the eosinophils before they can do their job. Resistant parasites might induce eosinophils to commit suicide, a useful property for us when we no longer need these cells, but a definite drawback if they still have a job to do. Parasitic worms have evolved to avoid at least some of our defences and sometimes they do this by mimicing natural processes important for regulating immune responses. In some diseases like asthma and allergy eosinophils slip from normal controls which regulate them and then they can cause tissue damage. Inhibitors of eosinophils which are produced by parasites might form the basis of new drugs to control these cells in diseases like asthma."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Gordon","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019275","middle_name":"Llewellyn","last_name":"Gordon","source_individual_id":"5014890","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Gordon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81912","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lindsay Dent","data":{"first_name":"Lindsay","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018666","middle_name":"Agin","last_name":"Dent","source_individual_id":"RMIS207800","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lindsay Dent"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81781","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2778","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Characterising the role of MID1 in X-linked Opitz syndrome: implications for CATCH22 and related disorders","data":{"media_summary":"hypospadias","end_year":2003,"keywords":["cell proliferation and migration","disease gene","microtubule associated proteins","protein-protein interactions","signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157958,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["CATCH 22","Opitz syndrome","cardiovascular disease","cleft lip and palate","hypospadias"],"scientific_title":"Characterising the role of MID1 in X-linked Opitz syndrome: implications for CATCH22 and related disorders","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Patients with Opitz syndrome commonly present with facial deformities (such as cleft lip and palate) as well as both genital and heart defects. Males are usually more severely affected than females although the severity of the disease can vary even amongst males of the same family. Patients can die suddenly in infancy or suffer further developmental impairment due to respiratory complications and swallowing difficulties that result from the significant facial deformities. A brighter outlook for patients is expected if early and often repeated surgical repair is undertaken to correct not only the facial deformities but also any heart and genital abnormalities. Our research laboratory has recently identified the gene that, when mutated, causes one form of Opitz syndrome. Defects in this gene account for around half the cases with the disorder. Evidence suggests that there may be a number of other genes involved in causing the remaining cases of the disease. The proposed research is aimed at investigating the molecular and developmental mechanisms that go awry as a result of the gene mutation. It is anticipated that these studies will provide valuable scientific knowledge about why some patients are more severely affected than others as well as offering clues to the identity of the genes that cause the remaining cases of Opitz syndrome. The results also have potentially important implications for the understanding of other diseases that show similar deformities. The knowledge gained from this research is expected to provide a valuable aid for effective genetic counselling (as well as the option of prenatal diagnosis) for families at risk of further affected pregnancies.

Most cases include an injection of either thiopentone or propofol directly into a vein. These drugs quickly produce the desired loss of consciousness, but can also produce significant undesirable effects on the circulatory system. To date, anaesthetists have relied on their accumulated experience to choose doses of these drugs that achieve an appropriate balance between their desirable and undesirable effects. However, the scientific basis of this process was poorly understood. Consequently, we conducted experiments in sheep in which we showed that the level of unconsciousness produced by these drugs depended on their concentration in the brain. Each sheep was unharmed and could be studied repeatedly. We established the important factors that influenced this brain concentration, and developed a unique computer model of the processes governing the desirable effects of thiopentone and propofol. However, understanding of what influences the undesirable effects of these drugs is less well developed. In this project, we propose a series of experiments in which we inject the thiopentone and propofol in special sites within the sheep so that we achieve low concentrations in some parts of the body, but high concentrations in others, while also measuring their undesirable effects. This will show which sites in the body high concentrations of drug should be avoided to minimise these undesirable effects. Another series of studies will be used to extend our computer model so that it can predict these undesirable effects. This extended model will allow anaesthetists to visualise and understand the fundamental factors influencing both the desirable and undesirable effects of thiopentone and propofol. This in turn will lead to dose strategies that help the anaesthetist maximise the desirable effects, while minimising the undesirable, in individual patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Upton","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040183","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Upton","source_individual_id":"RMIS5530","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Upton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87409","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Myburgh","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032779","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Myburgh","source_individual_id":"5016629","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Myburgh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85487","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Guy Ludbrook","data":{"first_name":"Guy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014560","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Ludbrook","source_individual_id":"RMIS6089","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Guy Ludbrook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80638","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2775","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Shigella flexneri O antigen polysaccharides: biosynthesis, function in virulence, and interaction with IcsA/VirG","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Cell surface virulence factors","Intracellular motility","Lipopolysaccharide and O antigen biosynthesis","Outer membrane proteins","Shigella flexneri pathogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157946,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Shigellosis","diarrhea","dysentery"],"scientific_title":"Shigella flexneri O antigen polysaccharides: biosynthesis, function in virulence, and interaction with IcsA/VirG","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Renato Morona","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157946","simplified_title":"Shigella flexneri LPS O antigen synthesis, function and interaction with IcsA","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"468055.08","source_system":"Shigella flexneri bacteria cause dysentery in millions of humans each year. The bacterium invades and replicates within the cells of the large intestine. Inside cells, S. flexneri is able to use the host cell's actin-based motility machinery to become motile within the cells, and this can be seen as F-actin comet tails extending from one end of the cell. Bacterial cell surface components residing in the outer membrane are important for the bacterium's ability to cause disease. Two of these components (lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and their polysaccharide chains (O antigens), and IcsA-VirG protein)) are required for initiating actin polymerisation, and mutations affecting synthesis of these components reduce ability to cause disease. In previous studies we have found that O antigen and the synthesis and function of IcsA are interrelated. This project will study how the O antigens are synthesised and their chain length determined by the Wzz protein, and the Wzz structure in relation to its function will also be characterised. The role played by O antigen in intracellular motility will be studied to determine the mechanisms involved. Infection of cells and cell free extracts, antibodies, and an enzyme which specifically degrades the O antigen, will be used to study how O antigen affect the interaction between bacteria with human cell proteins. The relationship between O antigen and IcsA function will be studied using monoclonal antibodies raised to IcsA. The effect of LPS on the outer membrane protease IcsP will be investigated, as will the effect of LPS lipid A mutations on O antigen and virulence. These studies will contribute to a better understanding of the biosynthesis of an ubiquitous bacterial cell surface component (O antigen), its function as a virulence factor in bacterial interactions with host cells.

The major form of treatment is methadone taken as maintenance treatment once a day. While methadone is effective in most addicts, about one third of them complain that it does not last long enough and they either tolerate this inadequate form of treatment or are prescribed a newer drug as part of a clinical trial or drop out and revert to heroin. We have previously shown that the blood levels of methadone are important in determining its best use and specifically, that those addicts for whom methadone does not hold have a greater drop in their blood levels after methadone has been absorbed into the body. This drop in blood levels is mainly due to methadone's redistribution throughout the body. Very little is known about how methadone distributes and redistributes throughout the body but it appears that the lung is the most important organ. A number of questions need to be answered to improve methadone's use: 1. How quickly is methadone taken up into the lung compared to the brain; 2. Why is the lung able to take up and release a large amount of methadone; 3. How does decreased respiration influence the lung and brain uptake of methadone; 4. What happens when another drug is prescribed (such as an antidepressant) which reduces the lung uptake of methadone; 5. Do some of the newer drugs for heroin addiction have better lung distribution and binding properties. We will perform studies of the concentrations of methadone and newer drugs in sheep that will provide the scientific basis for answering these questions and permit better use of drug treatment for heroin addiction."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Upton","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040183","middle_name":"N","last_name":"Upton","source_individual_id":"RMIS5530","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Upton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87409","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Somogyi","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004750","middle_name":"Alexander","last_name":"Somogyi","source_individual_id":"RMIS7262","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Somogyi"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77990","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2773","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Oxygen, oxidative phosphorylation and regulation of embryo development.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["culture","metabolism","pre-implantation embryo","pregnancy establishment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157941,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["fetal growth","infertility","multiple births"],"scientific_title":"Oxygen, oxidative phosphorylation and regulation of embryo development.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Reproduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Jeremy Thompson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157941","simplified_title":"Oxygen and embryo development","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"141096.27","source_system":"There is concern that human infertility treatment requiring the growth of embryos in the laboratory, as applied in human IVF, may cause problems during fetal development or even possibly lead to health problems much later in life as an adult. In particular, many clinics are now growing human embryos outside the body for several days longer (to select the best embryos for transfer) than what occurred a decade ago. This concern is based on the evidence that the environment in which an embryo grows in has an impact on the way in which some genes are switched on and off. Normal on-off switching at appropriate times during early development should lead to healthy offspring. Failure to turn off or on, or inappropriate timing, may lead to consequences that manifest themselves later in development. We believe that oxygen concentration and the activity of mitochondria, the organelles of cells that converts oxygen into energy, are key regulators in turning on and off genes during early embryo development. This is because we have shown that, in embryos of a species that is metabolically similar to the human embryo, oxygen concentration and mitochondria activity need to change as the embryo grows for optimal development in the laboratory. In other mammalian cells, oxygen and mitochondria activity are known to turn on or off several particular genes, known as transcription factors. Transcription factors are genes which regulate other genes. Therefore, transcription factors are good candidates as regulators of early embryo development. The present project aims to determine if factors such as changing oxygen concentration and mitochondria activity during laboratory growth of embryos affects the way in which these transcription factors turn on and off. If we find this is true, the way in which human embryos are grown in the laboratory needs to be examined carefully to minimize the risk of possible long-term consequences to the resulting fetus."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jeremy Thompson","data":{"first_name":"Jeremy","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016642","middle_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"Thompson","source_individual_id":"5011723","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Jeremy Thompson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81222","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2772","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Is insulin sensitivity in children and their mothers programmed by maternal blood glucose?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Children","Fetal origins of adult diseases","Glucose","Insulin sensitivity","Metabolic Syndrome"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157935,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Fetal programming","Insulin sensitivity in children","Metabolic syndrome"],"scientific_title":"Is insulin sensitivity in children and their mothers programmed by maternal blood glucose?","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"E/Pr Jeffrey Robinson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157935","simplified_title":"Fetal origins of adult disease and insulin sensitivity in children","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"169630.68","source_system":"Glucose intolerance in pregnancy is associated with the birth of large-for-dates and macrosomic (>4000g) babies.

This study will test the long-term benefits of treatment during pregnancy of women with impaired glucose tolerance on the subsequent regulation of glucose tolerance. We shall invite women who took part in the Australian Carbohydrate Study in Pregnancy (ACHOIS) to return and have an intravenous glucose tolerance test.

An essential virulence factor of the pneumococcus is the polysaccharide capsule which protects it from the immune defences of the host during an infection. Until recently, very little was known of the pneumococcal genes involved in production of this antigen. This project aims to continue characterization of these genes, and examination of the factors which regulate their expression. This regulatory mechanism may be very important, because production of increased levels of the polysaccharide capsule is believed to be an crucial step in the transition from carriage to invasion.

The normal turnover of a number of cellular proteins is mediated by a complex pathway involving a highly conserved polypeptide called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a number of proteins is essential for the maintenance of the health of a cell. Many cell cycle proteins, membrane channels, receptors and products of some oncogenes are known targets of the ubiquitin-dependent turnover. Clearly, a defect in this tightly regulated mechanism for the downregulation of proteins can result in a pathological condition and therefore it is important to understand how this pathway is regulated at molecular level. In the multistep ubiquitin pathway, some component enzymes called E3 are required for specifying the targets to be degraded. We discovered one such enzyme Nedd4. One of the proteins regulated by Nedd4 is epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Loss of Nedd4-mediated regulation of ENaC results in Liddle's Syndrome, a genetic form of hypertension. Since Nedd4 is expressed in many tissues and during development, we predicted that Nedd4 may regulate other important proteins in addition to ENaC. We have recently identified several proteins which interact with Nedd4. Some of these proteins are likely to play important roles in cellular regulation and during development. The proposed project is designed to characterise these proteins. We believe that by studying these proteins we will learn a great deal about the cellular regulatory pathways. In summary, Nedd4 is an important protein involved in cellular regulation and has a proven role in human disease. A study of characterising targets of Nedd4 will be vital in understanding the molecular basis of cell regulation and its implication in disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sharad Kumar","data":{"first_name":"Sharad","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008480","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kumar","source_individual_id":"RMIS11591","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78992","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2768","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular Regulation of Programmed Cell Death","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Apoptosis/ programmed cell death","Bcl-2 family","Caspases","Drosophila","Mechanisms of caspase activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157920,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["cancer","degenerative disorders","genetic disease"],"scientific_title":"Molecular Regulation of Programmed Cell Death","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Extensive apoptosis occurs during foetal development which is required to get rid of many excess cells produced during the growth of the embryo. Selective apoptosis is also essential for the formation of different tissues and organs in developing foetus. In the adult, apoptosis is required for proper functioning of the immune system, to remove virus infected and cancer cells and in general to maintain the correct number of cells in the body. As such, misregulation of apoptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of a wide array of diseases such as autoimmune diseases, many forms of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), heart disease, ischaemia and other conditions. To understand, manage and treat disorders that result from aberrant apoptosis, we need to know at molecular and cellular level, how apoptosis is brought about and how it is regulated. We have been studying these processes in detail for several years. Central to the apoptotic execution of cell death are a group of proteases that target many cellular proteins for specific cleavage. The activation of these proteases is the crucial step in the initiation of apoptosis and therefore each cell has developed complex ways to control this process. If we understand how these regulatory mechanisms operate, we can then formulate strategies that are targeted towards pathologies involving abnormal apoptosis. Various molecules that are involved in the execution and regulation of apoptosis are potentially excellent targets for therapeutic intervention in a number of disorders and will lead to the development of novel drugs for the treatment and prevention of many pathological conditions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Helena Richardson","data":{"first_name":"Helena","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015859","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Richardson","source_individual_id":"RMIS11594","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Helena Richardson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80995","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sharad Kumar","data":{"first_name":"Sharad","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008480","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kumar","source_individual_id":"RMIS11591","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Sharad Kumar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78992","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2767","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Repeated Prenatal Corticosteroids: effects on childhood development, behaviour, growth and health","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["blood pressure","childhood growth","corticosteroids","randomised clinical trial","sensioneural disability, cerebral palsy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157915,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["cerebral palsy","childhood growth","corticosteroids","sensioneural disability"],"scientific_title":"Repeated Prenatal Corticosteroids: effects on childhood development, behaviour, growth and health","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157915","simplified_title":"Repeated Prenatal Corticosteroids: effects on childhood development, behaviour, growth and health","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"718055.08","source_system":"Infants born preterm are at high risk of needing help with their breathing to survive.

The trial will be able to assess whether repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids are helpful or not for infants at risk of being born very preterm by comparing the short term effects on infant health after birth and whilst in hospital with the effects on the child's later health, growth and development. An economic assessment of repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids will be made in these children."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Janet Hiller","data":{"first_name":"Janet","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037278","middle_name":"Esther","last_name":"Hiller","source_individual_id":"RMIS14521","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Janet Hiller"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86660","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Lex Doyle","data":{"first_name":"Lex","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030462","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Doyle","source_individual_id":"RMIS71722","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Lex Doyle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84908","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Caroline Crowther","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018491","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Crowther","source_individual_id":"RMIS4107","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81738","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2766","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Glucose Intolerance in Pregnancy : a randomised trial of current management practices","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Dietary intervention","Health Care Evaluation","Randomised controlled trial","Screening","Women's Health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":157914,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Dietary intervention","Screening","Women's Health"],"scientific_title":"Glucose Intolerance in Pregnancy : a randomised trial of current management practices","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Caroline Crowther","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/157914","simplified_title":"Glucose Intolerance in Pregnancy : a randomised trial of current management practices","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"346527.54","source_system":"Glucose intolerance in pregnancy is diagnosed when a higher level of glucose than normal is found in blood after an oral glucose tolerance test.

Ecstasy can cause death within hours of ingestion but this occurs only in a small number of users. In contrast, there is recent compelling evidence that a large proportion of users of this drug develop significant and irreversible brain damage due to its use. This latter toxicity is insidious in that it may not become evident to users as impaired brain function until years after their drug use. As a result of the emerging scientific evidence, The National Institute of Drug Abuse in the USA has recognised the major adverse health impact of these drugs in a recent inititative. The brain has a blood brain barrier to stop toxic substances entering, but we postulate that this is damaged by the immediate effects of ecstasy. This allows acces of toxic breakdown products from the drug to enter the brain and cause the long term damage. If we understand the biological mechanisms which link the immediate and long term effects of ecstasy, we should be in a position to design strategies or therapies which limit its harmful effects. The purpose of this project is to 1. establish if the blood brain barrier is damaged by ecstasy 2. identify environmental factors which contribute to the severity of the toxic effects. We believe that an understanding of these events and the development of evidence based rational treatments for these toxicities is essential: 1 in the short term, to prevent injury and death from these drugs,and 2 in the long term, to prevent a potential major public health problem from neurodegenerative deficits that may be magnified as users age.

Infections are common in Australia, especially in day-care centres and outback Aboriginal communities. The 1998 Sydney water crisis highlighted the necessity of monitoring reservoirs and reticulated water for contamination by faecal cysts of both human and animal origin. The aim of this project is to learn more about the 'coat' proteins which cover the organisms. These protect the parasites against digestion, enabling them to reside indefinitely within the intestine. However, the proteins are also the principal target of host immunity. Analysis of Giardia populations has shown that as many as 150-200 different coat proteins can be made. Although individual cells have coats comprised of only a single protein type, these can 'switch' spontaneously to production of another type - a phenomenon known as 'antigenic variation'. This process occurs slowly but continuously, giving rise to 'variants' which survive successive host responses (directed against each predominant coat type) and occupy the vacancies left by the destruction of their immediate forebears. It is important to gain information about the structural diversity of these variant-specific proteins (VSP), as any 'Giardia' vaccine is likely to require inclusion of each major type. It is also important to elucidate how the 'switching' process occurs, as this may provide clues as to how it might be interrupted.

The action of IGF-II in stimulating tumour growth is mediated through Type 1 IGF receptors on the surface of the cells. The IGF binding protein, IGFBP-2, has been shown to increase the action of IGF-II in some cancer cells in vitro. by binding to the outside of the cells as an IGF-II-IGFBP-2 complex and then presenting the IGF-II to the receptor by a process of sustained release. We propose to produce a very high affinity form of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (OOptimised IGFBP-2O) which will sequester the IGF-II and effectively prevent it from binding to the receptor or the native IGFBP-2. We shall also engineer the OOptimised IGFBP-2O so that it is unable to bind to the outside of the cells. With this novel peptide, OOptimised IGFBP-2O, we will test the hypothesis that the growth of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-dependent tumours can be arrested by preventing the localisation and presentation of IGF-II to IGF receptors.

DNA is consistently exposed to an array of damaging agents, but the majority of mutations are corrected by cellular repair mechanisms. We now know that if these mechanisms work normally, too few mutations persist for cancer to result. However if these DNA damage repair mechanisms are themselves faulty, a high mutation rate occurs and a high risk of cancer results. DNA damage has another outcome. If the damage is too extensive, the cell commits suicide, not because it cannot function, but because it senses the DNA damage and chooses to die. One poorly understood aspect of the response to DNA damage is how the cell senses the damage and activates the suicide process. We have discovered a novel gene that appears to play a role in this sensing and suicide signalling process. The mouse version of this gene can itself act as a cancer-causing gene. We propose, however, to study the equivalent gene in Drosophila melanogaster, a more powerful experimental system, to characterise in detail its role in these processes. In this way we hope to generate a much more detailed understanding of the way that cells deal with DNA damage and choose suicide when the damage is too severe."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Saint","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039485","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Saint","source_individual_id":"5017312","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Saint"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87241","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1815","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Conditional gene targeting of an X-linked activator of cytochrome c: modelling of an infantile cardiomyopathy.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["X chromosome inactivation","cytochrome c","disease modelling","mitochondria","respiratory chain"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104912,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["X-linked disease","arrhythmias","disease modelling","infantile cardiomyopathy"],"scientific_title":"Conditional gene targeting of an X-linked activator of cytochrome c: modelling of an infantile cardiomyopathy.","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

The past few years has seen a dramatic increase in the identification of genetic abnormalities underlying such irregularities. In particular, a significant proportion of these abnormalities (known as mitochondriopathies) have been shown to be due to deficiencies or defects in the mitochondrial DNA, which encodes some of the components necessary for the generation of cellular energy stores. In contrast, surprisingly few examples exist where this type of disorder has been shown to be due to a defect in the DNA from the nucleus, despite the numerous components it encodes. We have strong genetic and biochemical evidence to suggest that a new gene (encoded by the nuclear DNA) underlies the sex-linked disorder, oncocytic cardiomyopathy, the major clinical features of which are sudden and irregular heart rhythms usually causing death in female infants before the age of two years. We will utilise a new and powerful genetic technique to reproduce the disorder in laboratory mice to enable a thorough investigation into how the disease manifests itself. It is hoped that this disease model will provide valuable clues towards our understanding of other disorders with sudden heart rhythm abnormalities. It may also give additional support to the likelihood that similar nuclear-encoded defects contribute to the prevalence of, and-or susceptibility to, sudden infant mortality. The novel approach taken will also, for the first time, directly investigate the mechanisms that govern the severity of presentation of the disease in females. These studies will also complement other biochemical studies that are ongoing in our laboratory and will likely have implications for the clinical presentation of numerous other X-linked genetic disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Timothy Cox","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030139","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Cox","source_individual_id":"RMIS68783","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Timothy Cox"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84811","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1814","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Inhibition of Bone Resorption Increases Skeletal Mechanical Strength by Thickening Trabecular Structures","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Antiresorptive therapies","Bone Histomorphometry","Bone metabolism","Menopause","Osteoporosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104910,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Health related to ageing","Osteoporosis","Prevention of fractures","Women's Health"],"scientific_title":"Inhibition of Bone Resorption Increases Skeletal Mechanical Strength by Thickening Trabecular Structures","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Howard Morris","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104910","simplified_title":"Inhibition of Bone Resorption Prevents Fractures by Thickening Bone Structures","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"175648.59","source_system":"This project will identify the basis by which a number of therapies for osteoporosis decrease the risk of bone fractures.

However, these studies were small and there is a need for a larger well designed study to see whether acupuncture really does help with inducing labour. This study assesses whether women who have prolonged pregnancy can be successfully induced using acupuncture treatment. Women booked for a medical induction will be offered the opportunity to take part in the trial. Women interested in taking part in the trial will be randomly entered into one of two groups. One group will receive acupuncture and the other group will be given placebo- sham acupuncture. This second group involves the insertion of the needles into areas away from classical acupuncture points. Participation in the trial will take place over a two day period prior to the date of their planned induction. Each treatment will take one hour. Prior to term, focus groups will be held with women examining thier views on the use of acupuncture during pregnancy. All women will be asked to complete a questionnaire after the birth of their baby, this will ask for their views on acupuncture, their expectation and satisfaction from their birthing experience. There is no information to suggest there are any risks or side effects associated with the treatment. In 2001 we expect to report on the effectiveness of this treatment on the induction of labour and maintenance of labour and assessment of whether this treatment meets women's expectations and satisfaction.

IUGR has increased risks of asphyxia, poor glucose control, hypothermia, respiratory difficulties, neurological problems and poor immune function, many of which persist. IUGR is one of the most common clinical problems in obstetrics and neonatology, with ~6% of infants born IUGR in Australia in non-Aboriginal communities and between 7 to 17% in Aboriginal communities. Despite these adverse consequences for health of the individual throughout life, we do not currently have any effective therapies to treat IUGR. Small infants are mostly a result of an inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients before birth, due to an impaired capacity of the mother to acquire these for the placenta to deliver them to the growing fetus or due to poor functioning of the placenta itself. This intrauterine malnutrition not only slows growth, but impairs the development of a range of body functions leading to the increased risk of illness and death in IUGR. Therapies to be used before birth to treat IUGR need to either restore supply of oxygen and nutrients or to promote growth and functional development. We have discovered that administration of a major growth promoting hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), to the IUGR fetus, which has low levels of IGF-I, increases its growth. This project will therefore determine if directly giving this hormone in the IUGR fetus will restore development as well as growth before birth, improving function and hence survival and health after birth. If successful, the first effective approach to the antenatal treatment of IUGR will have been identified and would provide the essential knowledge for the design of a range of therapies to best restore the abundance of IGF within the IUGR fetus to improve perinatal and later outcomes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julie Owens","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021301","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Owens","source_individual_id":"5012294","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Julie Owens"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82469","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1810","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A randomised controlled trial investigating the respiratory effects of nitrogen dioxide in schoolchildren","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2001,"keywords":["environmental epidemiology","indoor air pollution","nitrogen dioxide","randomised controlled trial","respiratory disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104894,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["airways obstruction","asthma","bronchial hyperreactivity"],"scientific_title":"A randomised controlled trial investigating the respiratory effects of nitrogen dioxide in schoolchildren","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Louis Pilotto","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104894","simplified_title":"Health effects of nitrogen dioxide in children with asthma","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"212189.68","source_system":"Research has shown that exposures to air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide, ozone and respirable particulate matter less than 10 microns are associated with respiratory symptoms.

We aim to study the replication strategy of human hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the hepadnavirus family. Hepadnaviruses infect hepatocytes in the liver and are released in high numbers into the bloodstream. Infection is transmitted by blood or sexual contact. Hepadnaviruses cause acute and chronic infection with varying degrees of liver disease. The HBV DNA genome is formed by copying of a viral pre-genome made of RNA, into DNA. This process is called reverse transcription and is performed by the viral polymerase. Reverse transcription occurs within viral nucleocapsids made of core antigen. After formation of the new viral DNA genome, nucleocapsids are enveloped in surface antigen and are released from the cell. It is assumed that 1 copy of HBV pre-genomic RNA is packaged within each viral nucleocapsid. However, members of the retrovirus family that have common evolutionary origins to hepadnaviruses and also replicate via reverse transcription, contain 2 copies of RNA. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the AIDS virus, is a well-studied example. In HIV infection 2 RNA genomes are packaged into each nucleocapsid and form a dimeric RNA genome. The HIV RNA is able to fold into a series of stem loops that promote formation of dimers. During the reverse transcription step in HIV replication, the polymerase switches templates and forms new combined strains of virus. The project aims to determine if 2 copies of pre-genomic RNA are packaged into HBV nucleocapsids. HBV pre-genomic RNA is able to form stem loop structures similar to those in HIV and has the potential to form dimeric RNA. If 2 copies of HBV pre-genomic RNA are packaged this will allow us to redefine the viral replication strategy and to develop a greater understanding of the relationships between hepadnaviruses and retroviruses. The formation of dimers will also provide a mechanism for recombination between HBV strains."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert","data":{"first_name":"Allison","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002447","middle_name":"Rae","last_name":"Jilbert","source_individual_id":"RMIS72170","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Allison Jilbert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77334","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1807","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Making signalling through the tumour necrosis factor receptors selective for promoting neutrophil antimicrobial activity","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Mitogen activated protein kinases","Neutrophils","Tumour necrosis factor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104884,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Infectious diseases","Inflammatory diseases","Respiratory diseases"],"scientific_title":"Making signalling through the tumour necrosis factor receptors selective for promoting neutrophil antimicrobial activity","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Antonio Ferrante","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104884","simplified_title":"Making molecules which improve the body's infection fighting capabilities","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196312.97","source_system":"It is evident to the professional and general community that antibiotic and drug resistance displayed by bacteria is a continuing and growing problem in the treatment of infection with potentially casastrophic effect on the health of our community.

While body proteins formed (cytokines) which modify the behaviour of the immune system are being used as pharmaceuticals, their toxic side effects are problematic to the patient. Our project focusses on one of the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which increases the antimicrobial activity of phagocytic cells but in addition can have quite devastating effects on other tissues in the body. This is because when TNF binds to its receptor on cells and tissues it elicits a multitude of signals inside the cell which can also precipitate illness. The purpose of our investigations is to identify which signals are responsible for increasing resistance against infection and which are not. With this information we will then see if it is feasible to selectively stimulate this signal from outside the cell since this has a better chance of succeeding as a pharmaceutical.

Our laboratory has identified what we believe is one such protein - p160 - that binds to a part of Myb that reduces its activity, and thus that is likely to be responsible for regulating Myb. However, it has recently become apparent that p160 interacts with a number of other transcription factors in addition Myb. The primary aim of this project is to elucidate precisely how p160 interacts with Myb and what the consequences of this interaction are. A range of experimental approaches, which range from in vitro to genetic studies, will be employed to do this. We will test a specific role of p160 suggested by our preliminary studies - that of a transporter of transcription factors between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the cell. Because of the wide range of transcription factors that p160 interacts with, its effects on the function of the cell are likely to be profound. For this same reason, it is difficult to specifically predict the possible medical-health implications of this work However, what we know to date is consistent with a role for p160 as a tumour suppressor gene. Moreover, parts of this project aim to generate genetic information and tools which will help in determining whether p160 does play such a role and generally, in identifying any other associations of p160 with particular diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Gonda","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007535","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Gonda","source_individual_id":"5014863","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Gonda"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78737","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1804","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Analysis of intracellular signalling and biological activities of the GM-CSF receptor family using constitutive mutants","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor","differentiation","haemopoiesis","intracellular signalling","receptor crosstalk"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104877,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["inflammation","leukaemia","myeloproliferative disease"],"scientific_title":"Analysis of intracellular signalling and biological activities of the GM-CSF receptor family using constitutive mutants","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Thomas Gonda","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104877","simplified_title":"Use of novel forms of a growth factor receptor to understand how it acts","sub_type":"Standard Project with Research Fellowship","total_budget":"505699.84","source_system":"The cytokines GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 stimulate the growth and actions of a wide range of blood cells.

In most instances, there is evidence that the diseases are caused by an attack on the joint lining (the synovium) by cells of the immune system. Rheumatoid arthriis is the most common and often the most severe of the polyarthritides. Neither the triggering event nor the target of the attack by the immune system is understood and as a result, there are no specific preventative measures against the disease or specific therapies for the established disease. There is, however, strong evidence that the cells involved in the attack on the synovium are orchestrated by a white blood cell called the T lymphocyte. T lymphocytes cannot operate alone but require a second cell, the dendritic cell, to present the target in a special way which can be recognised and responded to by the T lymphocyte. The T cell and the dendritic cell are the two central aspects of this project. We will use an animal model of polyarthritis to allow access to these cells during the earliest phases of the disease, a silent period not recognisable in the earliest stages of rheumatoid arthritis. T lymphocytes from animals with experimental polyarthritis will be used as indicators in the search for the target of the disease process and dendritic cells from affected joints will be used as a natural source of that target. By the production of highly specific T lymphocytes (members of clones), we hope to identify the target molecules of the disease process. This information should lead ultimately to the identification of the triggering stimulus (and thence prevention) and to the development of highly specific therapies designed to treat the established disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Graham Mayrhofer","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044096","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mayrhofer","source_individual_id":"RMIS155314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Graham Mayrhofer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88428","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1802","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Analysis of the function of the presenilin genes during embryogenesis.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["developmental genetics","neurogenesis","presenilin genes","somitogenesis","zebrafish"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104870,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Dementia","Embryo development","Genetic disease"],"scientific_title":"Analysis of the function of the presenilin genes during embryogenesis.","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

Normal presenilin genes are also necessary for correct embryo development. There is evidence that the proteins produced by the presenilin genes interact with other proteins such as those produced by the Notch genes. Changes in Notch genes can also produce dementia and developmental defects. However, despite their obvious importance, we know little about how presenilin and Notch genes function and interact! We want to understand how presenilin genes interact with Notch genes and any other genes that are important for normal embryo development. To investigate this we are using the eggs of a small, freshwater fish, the zebrafish. These eggs are easily available (hundreds are produced by a female zebrafish every week), accessible and, being transparent, every cell in a developing zebrafish egg can be observed! They also develop about one hundred times faster that a human! In our experiments we will produce antibodies to the protein products of the presenilin and Notch genes of zebrafish and then use these to observe interactions between the presenilin and Notch proteins. We will observe how changes in the levels of presenilin protein in an embryo affect the function of the Notch genes and we will attempt to discover other genes that are affected by such changes. This work will be important for understanding how genes interact to create our bodies during embryo development.

In all societies, the incidence of low birth weight babies has remained above 5% and in some developing countries, it is greater than 30%. The hormonal responses which help the fetus survive periods of growth restriction in utero, result in a permanent reprogramming of the development of key fetal organs and tissues and the subsequent emergence of high blood pressure in later life. The fetal hormones which have been implicated in causing high blood pressure in adult life are known as glucocorticoids. Fetuses may be exposed to excess glucocorticoids through stress in the womb or through increased transfer of glucocorticoids across the placenta. Currently 85% of Australian obstetricians prescribe repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids in pregnancies in which the risk of preterm birth persists or recurs. The specific long term outcomes of fetal exposure to excess glucocorticoids are unknown and may depend on the timing, route, dose and type of glucocorticoids involved.

It is well known that the ability of mitochondria to maintain energy supplies decreases in old age. Over the past decade, research has shown that this is partly due to mutation of genes in the DNA which is found in mitochondria. However it is also very likely that the loss of function in mitochondria during the ageing process is also due to the accumulation of protein damage. Recent work in insects has shown that specific proteins in mitochondria are extensively damaged during the ageing process and-or exposure to oxygen radicals. In higher organisms such as mice, however, exactly which mitochondrial proteins are targeted by oxygen radicals is unknown. This work will investigate the likelihood that proteins located in membranes of mitochondria are targets for damage by oxygen radicals and during the ageing process. Furthermore, since oxygen radicals readily attack polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, we are investigating the likelihood that toxic substances (unsaturated aldehydes) formed during membrane damage contribute to the damage to mitochondrial proteins during the ageing process."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Philip Burcham","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012077","middle_name":"Cyril","last_name":"Burcham","source_individual_id":"RMIS16055","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Philip Burcham"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79967","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1796","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cytokines in milk modulate the development of immune responses in the infant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Maternal milk or infant formula","immune development","oral antigen challenge","transforming growth factor Beta"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104844,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["auto immune disease or food intolerance development","formula feeding of infants","maternal milk and immune development"],"scientific_title":"Cytokines in milk modulate the development of immune responses in the infant","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Irmeli Penttila","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104844","simplified_title":"Growth factors in maternal milk and development of infant immune responses","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"188912.18","source_system":"There is substantial epidemiological evidence that formula fed infants are more susceptible than breast fed infants to auto-immune diseases later in life.

Extensive apoptosis occurs during foetal development which is required to get rid of many excess cells produced during the growth of the embryo. Selective apoptosis is also essential for the formation of different tissues and organs in developing foetus. In the adult, apoptosis is required for proper functioning of the immune system, to remove virus infected and cancer cells and in general to maintain the correct number of cells in the body. As such, dysregulation of apoptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of a wide array of diseases such as autoimmune diseases, many forms of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), heart disease, ischaemia and other conditions. To understand, manage and treat disorders that result from aberrant apoptosis, we need to know at molecular and cellular level, how apoptosis is brought about and how it is regulated. We have been studying these processes in detail for several years. Central to the apoptotic execution of cell death are a group of proteases that target many cellular proteins for specific cleavage. The activation of these proteases is the crucial step in the initiation of apoptosis and therefore each cell has developed complex ways to control this process. If we understand how these regulatory mechanisms operate, we can then formulate strategies that are targeted towards pathologies involving abnormal apoptosis. Various molecules that are involved in the execution and regulation of apoptosis are potentially excellent targets for therapeutic intervention in a number of disorders and will lead to the development of novel drugs for the treatment and prevention of many pathological conditions.

There remains a pressing need to find better ways to treat this disease. Increasingly, cancer treatments will make use of a growing knowledge of the factors that normally regulate cell growth, and will apply this knowledge to make cancer cells more sensitive to existing anticancer treatments. We are proposing here to study the hormone calcitonin as a novel regulator of cancer cell growth. Calcitonin is better known as a hormone that inhibits bone loss, by acting on bone resorbing cells called osteoclasts. However, our present proposal is based on our recent finding that the receptor for calcitonin is for some reason also found in many breast cancers. Moreover, we have shown that calcitonin can potently inhibit the growth of cells that have the calcitonin receptor on their surface. We plan to extend these findings in 4 ways: 1 We will make use of a large bank of breast cancer samples at the Royal Adelaide Hospital to determine whether the presence of the calcitonin receptor in breast cancers is related to other features of the tumours, such as their propensity to spread to other organs. 2 We will investigate the mechanisms by which calcitonin slows the growth of cells. 3 We have unique access to new calcitonin-like molecules, called calcitonin mimetics, which we will investigate for the ability to inhibit cell growth. These molecules are much cheaper and probably easier to administer than calcitonin itself. 4 We will investigate whether treatment of cells with calcitonin makes them more sensitive to other anticancer treatments. We hope that success in this project will lead to a more detailed understanding of the way that molecules like calcitonin can regulate cell growth and to new treatment options for cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Findlay","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007262","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS18491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78660","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1791","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cell regulation of periprosthetic bone loss","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Aseptic implant loosening","Macrophage","Osteoblast differentiation","Osteoclast differentiation","Wear particles"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104818,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Artificial joint implant failure","Aseptic loosening","Pathological bone loss"],"scientific_title":"Cell regulation of periprosthetic bone loss","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr David Haynes","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104818","simplified_title":"Preventing premature failure of artificial joint implants","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"326201.58","source_system":"Artificial joint implants are widely used to replace diseased or damaged joints. Despite the impressive success of joint replacement many artificial joints do not last indefinitely. In many patients joints last for 25 years or more but in about 15% the artificial joints will fail prematurely. Artificial joints need to be replaced because of loosening resulting from the loss of bone from around the artificial joint. The bone loss is caused by large numbers of small particles generated by excessive wear of the artificial joint. We now know that specialised cells in the body react to the wear particles and try to destroy them. During this process they produce molecules which lead to bone destruction. This project seeks to investigate the way particles cause bone loss and to develop drug treatments that will either prevent the loss of bone or promote new bone to replace that which has been lost. The increasing use of joint replacement and an aging population means that the number of patients with artificial joint failure will increase. This will mean that an increasing amount of medical recourses will be needed to replace failed and painful artificial joints. It is planned that the findings obtained from this project will eventually result in drug treatments which can reduce the need for the replacement of artificial joints."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr David Haynes","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002107","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Haynes","source_individual_id":"RMIS18488","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr David Haynes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77248","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1790","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gastrointestinal sensory function in normal and diseased states","data":{"media_summary":"Visceral pain","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Autonomic nervous system- physiopathology","Colonic diseases, functional- physiopathology","Mechanoreceptors","Neurons-afferent-physiology","Visceral afferents- physiology and pharmacology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104814,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Functional dyspepsia","Functional gastrointestinal diseases","Irritable bowel syndrome","Non-cardiac chest pain","Visceral pain"],"scientific_title":"Gastrointestinal sensory function in normal and diseased states","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autonomic Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ashley Blackshaw","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104814","simplified_title":"Sensing of digestive processes in health and disease","sub_type":"Standard Project with Research Fellowship","total_budget":"691026.64","source_system":"Chronic pain and discomfort from the digestive system is a major health care issue world-wide.

Extremely obese, or extremely underweight women, find it difficult to become pregnant, and leptin is probably the connection between weight and fertility. This may be a particularly important factor in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a distressing condition which affects 5% of women and causes both obesity and infertility. Exciting new research suggests that leptin also affects the immune system, and previous NH and MRC funding has enabled us to demonstrate that the immune system plays a crucial role in maintaining normal ovarian function. The nutritional status of the body, the immune system and the reproductive system all interact, and leptin appears to be the connecting link between these three major systems. We propose that leptin plays a major role in the ovary, and wish to determine how leptin mediates the effects of bodyweight and the immune system on ovarian function. Laboratory rats will be treated with leptin, their food intake and weight recorded, and a few weeks later the rats will have their ovaries removed. We will find out whether ovaries respond to leptin, or whether the ovarian response changes according to the menstrual cycle: perhaps leptin is very important just before ovulation, but it does not affect menstruation? Do any ovarian cells make leptin? Will leptin stimulate ovaries to produce more oestrogen or progesterone, or ovulate more eggs? We will also identify immune system cells in the ovary, and note whether leptin affects them. We will be able to relate all this data to weight and diet. Increased understanding of leptins' effect on the ovary has the potential to lead to new, improved treatments for PCOS or for unexplained cases of infertility. It is also possible that in the future a weight-loss regime might be developed which takes a womans monthly cycle into account, therefore making weight-loss more efficient and attainable."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Norman","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003703","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Norman","source_individual_id":"RMIS31138","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Norman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77692","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1788","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gastric motility and blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus","data":{"media_summary":"postprandial hypotension","end_year":2002,"keywords":["diabetes mellitus","manometry","motility","radioisotopic methods","stomach"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104812,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["diabetes mellitus","gastrointestinal symptoms","gastroparesis","glycaemic control","postprandial hypotension"],"scientific_title":"Gastric motility and blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104812","simplified_title":"Effect of diabetes mellitus on stomach function - The role of stomach emptying in the control of blood glucose","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"354947.02","source_system":"The recent application of novel techniques to evaluate gastrointestinal motor function has established that the rate of which the stomach empties food is slow in up to 50% of people who have insulin-dependent (type 1) or non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes. Delayed stomach emptying was thought to be an infrequent complication in diabetes; much less common than damage to the eyes, kidneys or nerves. It is now recognised that disordered stomach emptying may contribute to a number of problems in diabetes, e.g. symptoms such as nausea and bloating and poor control of blood glucose concentrations. In some people symptoms are disabling and affect quality of life adversely. The effects of stomach emptying on blood glucose control is likely to be important, as it is desirable to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range to minimise the risk of both the development and progression of complications of diabetes. In many people with diabetes, particularly older people with type 2 diabetes, there is a fall in blood pressure after a meal which may result in fainting and falls. The magnitude of the fall in blood pressure is determined by the rate at which the stomach empties; faster emptying results in a greater fall in blood pressure. In the past both slow stomach emptying and symptoms were assumed to result from irreversible nerve damage, however it is now recognised that the blood glucose level itself has a reversible effect on both stomach contractions and symptoms. Our group has been the recipient of ongoing support from the NH and MRC for approximately 15 years to conduct research in this area. As a result we have performed the most comprehensive studies to date and developed new methods to evaluate stomach function in people with diabetes, resulting in international recognition. The studies proposed in this current application represent a logical development from our previous work and have important implications for the management of diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Horowitz","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0002272","middle_name":"","last_name":"Horowitz","source_individual_id":"5020423","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Horowitz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77291","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1787","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Reflex control of human jaw muscles by periodontal mechanoreceptors","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Mechanical tooth stimulation","Periodontal Mechanoreceptors","Reflex control of human jaw muscles","Single motor unit action potentials","Surface electromyography"],"nhmrc_grant_id":104810,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Bite force and chewing efficiency","Importance of teeth and their support structures","Temporomandibular dysfunction","Tooth loss and denture"],"scientific_title":"Reflex control of human jaw muscles by periodontal mechanoreceptors","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Kemal Turker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/104810","simplified_title":"Control of bite force","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"405173.36","source_system":"An understanding of the functional connection between the jaw muscles and various receptor organs in and around the mouth is necessary to elucidate the process of chewing and its underlying rules.

We will determine whether older people are more sensitive to gastric distension, which reduces appetite and food intake, by measuring perceptions (fullness, hunger, etc), gastric compliance and food intake during intragastric balloon inflation. This will also be done during nutrient infusion into the small intestine, to assess the interaction between gastric and intestinal satiety factors. The contribution of age-related slowing of gastric emptying to the anorexia of ageing will be assessed and the possibility that reduced energy intake worsens the anorexia of ageing will be examined in a nutrient supplementation study. We will have shown that the release of the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is greater in older than young adults and that CCK administration causes a greater suppression of food intake in older people, suggesting that increased CCK activity may be a cause of the anorexia of ageing. We will pursue these findings by attempting to increase appetite and food intake in the lderly by administration of a CCK antagonist (blocker). We will also measure the satiating effects of two other probable satiety hormones, amylin and glucagon like peptide 1 in older and young people.

Disruption of their normal structure and function is a major aspect of common diseases such as atherosclerosis, aneurisms, heart valve prolapse, emphysema, and the congenital disorder, Marfan syndrome. Elastic fibres consist of a core of the protein elastin surrounded by 12 nm glycoprotein microfibrils. During development the microfibrils always appear before the elastin and seem to act as a scaffold for the deposition of its precursor, tropoelastin. However knowledge of the role of each glycoprotein in the assembly, architecture, function and cell biology of microfibrils and elastic fibres is still very limited. Our laboratory has identified, cloned and characterised several microfibrillar proteins and we are uniquely placed to exploit our expertise and unique range of research tools to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the above processes. The Specific Aims are to determine a) the roles of individual components and associated proteins in microfibril and elastic fibre biology b) the architecture of microfibrils and the relationship of their structural heterogeneity to function during tissue development, c) the mechanisms responsible for microfibril and elastic fibre assembly, and other microfibril interactions with the cell surface, d) the gene regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of individual microfibrillar proteins and e) causative mutations of non-fibrillin genes in Marfan-like congenital disorders. The research will greatly increase our fundamental knowledge of the factors controlling the complex molecular mechanisms involved in microfibril assembly and elastic fibre formation, including the roles of individual microfibril-associated proteins, cell surface receptors, cellular processing, and gene regulation of these processes during normal development, which is essential before the full role of elastic fibres in major diseases can be understood."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Mark Gibson","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007475","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS989115","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Mark Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78720","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1784","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Tissue Engineering for the Periodontium","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Extracellular Matrix","Fibroblasts","Periodontium","Tissue Engineering"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102455,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Dentistry","Periodontics","Tissue engineering"],"scientific_title":"Tissue Engineering for the Periodontium","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Dental Technology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"DENTISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Peter Bartold","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102455","simplified_title":"Rebuilding damaged gums","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"239707.39","source_system":"Periodontal disease is an inflammatory disorder leading to tooth loosening and, if untreated, tooth loss.

Although there have been improvements in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, many men are still diagnosed with disease that already has or will spread to other sites such as bone (ie metastatic disease). For those men with metastatic disease, reduction in testicular androgens by surgical or medical means (ie androgen ablation) is the only effective treatment option available. While androgen ablation is initially effective, treatment failure is common, resulting in a very poor overall survival rate. Evidence from our studies and others suggest that, the androgen receptor, which mediates the growth regulatory effects of androgens is often defective in prostate tumour cells. These altered or mutant receptors are activated inappropriately by other sex hormones such as estradiol and even agents used in the treatment of prostate cancer whereas the normal receptor is activated only by testicular androgens. This mechanism may explain why treatment fails in a subset of men with advanced prostate cancer. The major objective of our current studies is to define how these mutant androgen receptors cause treatment failure and facilitate prostate tumour growth. In addition, the current studies will evaluate a novel approach to treatment of prostate cancer which, based upon our preliminary results, has the potential to be effective even if alterations are present in the androgen receptor.

This has important implications for the many women who have polycystic ovarian disease, whose follicles fail to grow to full size. We will be examining these ovaries directly. The research also has importance in the next phase of IVF developments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Raymond
