We will determine which dosing approach results in better antibacterial efficacy and reduce the development of antibiotic resistance."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jason Roberts","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033443","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Roberts","source_individual_id":"5017212","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jason Roberts"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85657","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeffrey Lipman","data":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032130","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipman","source_individual_id":"5012259","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jeffrey Lipman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85314","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Cornelia Landersdorfer","data":{"first_name":"Cornelia","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031934","middle_name":"Barbara","last_name":"Landersdorfer","source_individual_id":"5042544","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Cornelia Landersdorfer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85257","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Phillip Bergen","data":{"first_name":"Phillip","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029427","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Bergen","source_individual_id":"5043431","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Phillip Bergen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84629","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jurgen Bulitta","data":{"first_name":"Jurgen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017992","middle_name":"Bernd","last_name":"Bulitta","source_individual_id":"5043150","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Jurgen Bulitta"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81598","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Carl Kirkpatrick","data":{"first_name":"Carl","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014193","middle_name":"Michael","last_name":"Kirkpatrick","source_individual_id":"5015731","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Carl Kirkpatrick"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80526","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/75339","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Public health policies and interventions to reduce tobacco-related harms among socially disadvantaged populations and �low probability quitters�","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2017,"keywords":["harm reduction","tobacco dependence","social disadvantage","smoking","nicotine replacement therapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1061978,"application_year":2013,"start_year":2014,"scientific_title":"Public health policies and interventions to reduce tobacco-related harms among socially disadvantaged populations and �low probability quitters�","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health Promotion","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Coral Gartner","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1061978","simplified_title":"Public health policies and interventions to reduce tobacco-related harms among socially disadvantaged populations and �low probability quitters�","sub_type":"Population Health CDF","total_budget":"411767.04","source_system":"Tobacco continues to be a leading cause of preventable death and disease in Australia.

An improved understanding of this mechanism will lead to novel ways to combat GAS infections."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christine Wells","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040397","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Wells","source_individual_id":"5018258","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Christine Wells"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87466","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Walker","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010893","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS127362","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79668","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Victor Nizet","data":{"first_name":"Victor","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003693","middle_name":"","last_name":"Nizet","source_individual_id":"5030735","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Victor Nizet"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77687","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/73680","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to kidney progenitors","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2015,"keywords":["embryonic stem cells","differentiation","kidney development","kidney disease","pluripotential"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1041277,"application_year":2012,"health_keywords":["nanotechnology","regeneration"],"scientific_title":"Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to kidney progenitors","start_year":2013,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Regenerative Medicine (incl.

This improved diagnostic information should improve survival rates."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Olivier Salvado","data":{"first_name":"Olivier","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045247","middle_name":"","last_name":"Salvado","source_individual_id":"5019230","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Olivier Salvado"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88709","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Paul Thomas","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040054","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Thomas","source_individual_id":"5017905","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Paul Thomas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87378","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Michael Fay","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030635","middle_name":"Francis","last_name":"Fay","source_individual_id":"5018817","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Michael Fay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84961","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stuart Crozier","data":{"first_name":"Stuart","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024340","middle_name":"","last_name":"Crozier","source_individual_id":"5012384","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stuart Crozier"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83245","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephen Rose","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009965","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Rose","source_individual_id":"5017273","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephen Rose"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79404","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Coulthard","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001046","middle_name":"","last_name":"Coulthard","source_individual_id":"5014087","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alan Coulthard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76953","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65622","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Fibroblast growth factors in the development of forebrain commissures","data":{"media_summary":"midline brain disorders","end_year":2012,"keywords":["axon guidance","brain development","fibroblast growth factors","magnetic resonance imaging","neurobiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":631552,"application_year":2009,"health_keywords":["autism spectrun disorders","brain development","congenital brain defects","learning and cognitive deficits","midline brain disorders"],"scientific_title":"Fibroblast growth factors in the development of forebrain commissures","start_year":2010,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Linda Richards","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/631552","simplified_title":"Formation of connections between the cortical hemispheres of the brain","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"497796.03","source_system":"In order to function correctly the two hemispheres of the brain must communicate information.

Our results will provide new strategies for drugs against CMV."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Helen Farrell","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030627","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Farrell","source_individual_id":"5014571","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Helen Farrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84957","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Nicholas Davis-Poynter","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012654","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Davis-Poynter","source_individual_id":"5014228","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Nicholas Davis-Poynter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80128","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65589","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["infectious disease","streptococcal disease","streptococcal infection","streptococcal invasive diseases","vaccines"],"nhmrc_grant_id":631386,"application_year":2009,"start_year":2010,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Mark Walker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/631386","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"715099.88","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Walker","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010893","middle_name":"J.","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS127362","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79668","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65588","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["cell cycle","melanoma","mitosis","molecular mechanisms"],"nhmrc_grant_id":631384,"application_year":2009,"start_year":2010,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development, Proliferation and Death","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/631384","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"591080.99","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007391","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Gabrielli","source_individual_id":"5014734","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78693","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/65587","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["adhesion mechanisms","cytoskeleton","signalling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":631383,"application_year":2009,"start_year":2010,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Interactions (incl.

In this grant we will refine this animal model and explore the brain, behavioural and genetic correlates of advanced paternal age."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Darryl Eyles","data":{"first_name":"Darryl","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042305","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Eyles","source_individual_id":"5014564","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Darryl Eyles"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87979","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Thomas Burne","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023865","middle_name":"Henry Johnston","last_name":"Burne","source_individual_id":"5013713","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Thomas Burne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83125","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mcgrath","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009022","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Mcgrath","source_individual_id":"RMIS3680751","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mcgrath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79147","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Emma Whitelaw","data":{"first_name":"Emma","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005414","middle_name":"","last_name":"Whitelaw","source_individual_id":"5018282","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Emma Whitelaw"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78177","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/64327","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Antibody-directed delivery of anti-restenotic agents using inorganic nanoparticles","data":{"media_summary":"targeted therapy","end_year":2012,"keywords":["anti-restenosis therapy","cardiovascular disease","drug delivery","drug targeting","nanotechnology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":569525,"application_year":2008,"health_keywords":["atherosclerosis","drug delivery systems","restenosis","restenosis after angioplasty","targeted therapy"],"scientific_title":"Antibody-directed delivery of anti-restenotic agents using inorganic nanoparticles","start_year":2009,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Objectives: This study aims to systematically review the evidence for psychological and-or educational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue. Methods: This study will use the Cochrane Collaboration�s methodology to search, critically appraise, and analyse randomised controlled trials of psychological and-or educational interventions. This will involve collaboration with consumers and with the Cochrane Pain, Palliative Care, and Supportive Care Collaborative Review Group.

The role of paracetamol in the management of pain in patients with advanced cancer on opioids needs to be defined. Managing pain with treatment supported by the best possible evidence for individual patients and producing any improvement in pain will improve patients� functional status, and will greatly improve QOL for patients and carers. N-of-1 trials are randomized, double-blind cross-over comparisons of active drug with placebo or another drug. The patient is their own control. N-of-1 trials provide objective means of testing effectiveness of medicines in individuals, providing evidence stronger than randomised controlled trial evidence for the efficacy of that drug in that individual. We will pilot N-of-1 trials of paracetamol for pain in 10 patients.

We will complete recruitment and assessment of a cohort of 1500 postmenopausal women with either low or high bone mineral density from pre-existing population cohorts in Australia. A genomewide association study will then be performed on these cases. Associated genes in different datasets will then be investigated further in our cohort, and high-density SNP mapping performed to identify true associated variants.

Quicker repair of lung damage and patient recovery are the benefits of this study."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Gary Cowin","data":{"first_name":"Gary","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041797","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Cowin","source_individual_id":"5011610","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Gary Cowin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87847","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andreas Schibler","data":{"first_name":"Andreas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039550","middle_name":"","last_name":"Schibler","source_individual_id":"5012068","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Andreas Schibler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87258","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham Galloway","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036756","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Galloway","source_individual_id":"5014770","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Graham Galloway"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86521","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Marlies Friese","data":{"first_name":"Marlies","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030772","middle_name":"Elly Joy","last_name":"Friese","source_individual_id":"5011609","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Marlies Friese"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84982","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Deming Wang","data":{"first_name":"Deming","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028655","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Wang","source_individual_id":"5018194","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Deming Wang"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84421","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Fraser","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007344","middle_name":"Francis","last_name":"Fraser","source_individual_id":"5011410","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Fraser"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78686","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/63361","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular characterization of dengue virus fusion and antiviral inhibitors.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["antiviral","dengue","membrane fusion","protein structure"],"nhmrc_grant_id":519709,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["antiviral drug","dengue fever","drug discovery"],"scientific_title":"Molecular characterization of dengue virus fusion and antiviral inhibitors.","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Paul Young","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/519709","simplified_title":"Understanding how dengue virus enters cells and how to prevent it.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"573557.21","source_system":"Dengue viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and cause major epidemics in more than 100 countries around the world, including Australia.

Such work will provide an evidence-base for policy and practice on this topic and the project findings will help develop CAM initiatives and programs for women�s health that are sensitive to geographical variations in community health, health practice and provision. Women are significantly more likely to utilise CAM treatments than males and mid-age women have been found to be the highest CAM user group amongst Australian women. Researchers and practitioners have identified treatments from within CAM as potentially well-suited to dealing with a range of health problems and associated symptoms prevalent amongst mid-age women including the onset of cancer, arthritis, diabetes and asthma as well as menopause. Our previous pilot work found that mid-age women in regional areas are significantly more likely to use CAM than those in urban areas. A number of explanations as to why this is so can be or have been proposed. These include: limited access to conventional health care services in regional areas; closer working ties between non-urban general practitioners and CAM provision; dissatisfaction with conventional health care services in regional areas and stronger informal community networks in nonurban areas. Our proposed project, drawing upon a national representative sample of mid-age women will test such hypotheses and will provide findings of benefit and interest to policy makers, practitioners, consumers and all involved in women�s health and health care across urban and regional Australia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jonathan

Also, having family members manage the older person�s assets may result in family conflict. There is a small amount of overseas research examining this issue. However, no comprehensive and validated method exists internationally or in Australia to determine competency in this context. We will test a methodology for assessing the capacity of individuals to manage their own financial affairs where dementia is an issue. This method involves the use of a number of reliable and well-validated instruments measuring the older person�s mental state, anxiety levels, depression, and social vulnerability combined with an interview exploring the personal circumstances of the older adult in relation to their financial affairs. We will work with the Office of the Adult Guardian in Queensland to recruit participants and to verify both the utility and usability of our methodology with stakeholders (e.g. solicitors, the Office of the Adult Guardian). A comparison will be made between the results obtained in approximately 200 financial competency cases with the competency opinions independently arrived at by the Office of the Adult Guardian in Queensland. As a result of this research, we will be able to ascertain the viability and utility of this assessment method, improve the method as per the data gathered, and ultimately seek future funding to trial the methods across multiple jurisdictions (e.g. other states) and contexts (e.g. various cultural contexts)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gill Wilson","data":{"first_name":"Gill","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034764","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wilson","source_individual_id":"5018384","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gill Wilson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86002","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gerard Byrne","data":{"first_name":"Gerard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023904","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Byrne","source_individual_id":"5013745","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gerard Byrne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83133","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Cheryl Tilse","data":{"first_name":"Cheryl","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016671","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tilse","source_individual_id":"5017947","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Cheryl Tilse"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81230","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nancy Pachana","data":{"first_name":"Nancy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003819","middle_name":"Ann","last_name":"Pachana","source_individual_id":"RMIS1713128","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nancy Pachana"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77727","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62976","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Practitioner Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Hypoxia ischaemia peperfusion injury to the brain","Infant newborn","Neurodevelopmental disorders, Perinatal hypoxia","Perinatalasphyxia, Perinatal physiology","low birth weight, neonatal seizures"],"nhmrc_grant_id":511117,"application_year":2007,"start_year":2008,"scientific_title":"Practitioner Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Colditz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/511117","simplified_title":"Practitioner Fellowship","sub_type":"Practitioner Fellowship","total_budget":"514013.81","source_system":"I am a perinatal paediatrician undertaking clinically-focussed research on brain development, brain disorders, brain therapies, neurodevelopmental outcomes and the development, application and evaluation of new technology to clinical problems."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Colditz","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006654","middle_name":"Bernard","last_name":"Colditz","source_individual_id":"RMIS23314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Colditz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78507","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62975","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Improved patient outcomes through dosage individualisation of the newer immunosuppressant drugs","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Computer-based decision support","Mycophenolate mofetil","Organ transplatation","Pharmacodynamics","Tacrolimus"],"nhmrc_grant_id":511109,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Dose individualisation","Drug efficacy","Health services","Organ transplantation"],"scientific_title":"Improved patient outcomes through dosage individualisation of the newer immunosuppressant drugs","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Christine Staatz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/511109","simplified_title":"Tailoring doses of the newer immunosuppressant drugs","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"486206.94","source_system":"After organ transplantation, recipients need to take medicines continually to stop their immune system from rejecting their new organ.

affecting 1 in 500 young Australians. While the brain lesion is static, the musculoskeletal problems are progressive and require lifelong management (cost of US$946,000 over life per person). Only large prospective population-based studies give a true indication of the incidence of physical problems, determine the pathway(s) to outcome and determine the best pathways to successful treatment and efficient resource allocation. The broad aim of this project is: This population based cohort study (n - 240) aims to determine the pathway to motor outcome from diagnosis at 18 months to 5 years based on the nature of the brain injury at 24 months (structural MRI of the nature, location and timing of the brain lesion). Secondary Aims: Determine the rate of musculoskeletal deformity (hip displacement, spasticity, muscle contracture). Potential impact of medical co-morbidities (nutrition, epilepsy, respiratory problems) Patterns of participation and HRQOL. Patterns of medical resource use: treatment costs and outcomes. This study will: Allow clinicians to better the likely functional outcomes of children with CP from an earlier age based on the rate and limit of gross motor development and nature and severity of the brain lesion, determine the nature and timing of physical deformities to aid prevention and treatment; provide information on resource use for future planning and organisation of medical and therapy services. This in turn will give more accurate prognostic counseling as well as target areas for early therapy. Our multidisciplinary research group is uniquely placed to conduct this world-first study with access to two entire birth years of children linked to our Victorian Cerebral Palsy Register. Recruitment is conducted at both the Royal Children's Hospital and the Monash Medical centre in order to ensure state wide referral and easy access for

Methodological barriers include: difficulties in recruitment, high rates of attrition, problems with maintaining distinct and sustainable intervention strategies, poorly chosen outcomes and opposition to randomization. Organizational barriers include: lack of research infrastructure, few trained clinical researchers, prioritisation of clinical responsibilities and funding difficulties. The hierarchy of evidence rates RCTs as the gold standard. An alternative is the n-of-1 trial: a randomized, double-blind cross-over comparison of active drug with placebo or another drug. The patient is in effect their own control. N-of-1 trials provide an objective means of testing the effectiveness of medicines in individual patients, providing evidence stronger than RCT evidence for the efficacy of that drug in that particular individual. If multiple n-of-1 trials are conducted, the resultant data amounts to RCT evidence for that treatment in a population. We propose n-of-1 trials as a workable option for researching the benefit of drugs and other therapies in PC patients. If successful, this model could be accepted internationally as the gold standard for research in this difficult population group. This would be a world first and of great national and international significance. In advanced cancer, the prevalence of fatigue is very high at 60-90% and can be related to the treatment or the disease itself. The impact of fatigue on function (physical, mental, social and spiritual) and hence quality of life (QOL) is very significant for many palliative patients as well as their families-carers. The role of pyschostimulants in the management of fatigue in patients with advanced cancer and life limiting disease needs to be defined. We will conduct n-of-1 trials of psychostimulants (i.e. methylphenidate) for fatigue in a group of 40 patients, recruited from 5 sites around Australia through a national clinical trial network recently set up for palliative care research. Managing fatigue with treatment supported by the best possible evidence for individual patients and producing any improvement in fatigue will improve patients� functional status, and will greatly improve QOL for patients and carers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael

Conceptually, the delivery device is a set of microscopic nanoneedles coated with drug substance and applied to the skin as a small patch. The device is practical, needle-free and pain-free. The aim of this current project is to use the micro-nanoprojection array patches-configured to uniquely deliver biomolecules to cells within given strata-to find: 1) what delivery sites of antigen-expression plasmid- toll like receptor (TLR) agonist lead to strong humoral immune responses in the intact animal. 2) whether delivery of different TLR agonists have different effects on the maturation and migration of the different professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the skin, as visualised locally by Multi-Photon Microscopy (MPM). 3) whether differences in APC maturation and migration are associated with different systemic antibody responses. We will identify optimal delivery sites of drugs-vaccines to the skin (layer, cells targeted, duration of delivery) with MPM for desired systemic immune responses. This will have important contributions towards improving immunotherapeutics of major diseases via skin targeting with micro-nanoprojection array patch technologies (and other methods)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Kendall","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043459","middle_name":"Af","last_name":"Kendall","source_individual_id":"5015660","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Mark Kendall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88269","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61755","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Transcriptional complexity of cell cycle regulated genes during cell division and tumorigenesis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cell cycle regulation","kinases","melanoma","phosphatase","transcriptomics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456140,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["DNA damage","melanoma","tumorigenesis"],"scientific_title":"Transcriptional complexity of cell cycle regulated genes during cell division and tumorigenesis","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Sean Grimmond","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456140","simplified_title":"Transcriptional complexity of cell cycle regulated genes during cell division and tumorigenesis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"491703.23","source_system":"Massive scale transcriptome and genome annotation efforts have recently identified all genes encoding the cellular machinery of protein phosphorylation.

This grant is aimed at addressing the role of transcriptional complexity in the control of normal cell division and tumorigenesis using a systems wide approach. Rather than relying on the locus based study, this proposal seeks to take a systems biology approach, addressing the functional diversity of the expanded human phosphoregulator proteome, identifying all components of the network that are actively and dynamically expressed in the normal cell cycle and-or tumour progression, and then screening selected novel components for an ability regulate the cell cycle.

These pirated proteins are exploited by the virus to enable it to replicate and persist in the infected individual, usually by evading or gaining advantage from the normal immune response. This project will investigate the role of one such protein found in both human and animal herpesviruses (specifically cytomegaloviruses (CMV)) that is conserved with cellular cell surface proteins (receptors) that bind immune signaling molecules (chemokines). Chemokines are important proteins in the early response to infection. Binding of chemokines to their receptors initiates a cascade of signals within the cell that has profound effects on cellular responses to environmental stimuli. Thus, it is believed that herpesviruses have acquired chemokine receptors to modify or react to the immune response, causing infected cells to behave abnormally either despite or in response to chemokine signals. This project will determine how this CMV specific protein affects the function of cells that CMV infects and how this may promote virus replication, dissemination and persistence in infected hosts. We will also engineer CMVs where the activity of the target protein can be inhibited by administration of prototype antiviral drugs. If inhibition of the activity of the protein is found to reduce virus replication, dissemination or persistence, then this will demonstrate that this type of protein would be a suitable target for the development of novel drugs active against CMV infections. CMV can cause serious (potentially life threatening) disease in newborn children (following infection in the uterus) and immunosuppressed people (eg. organ transplant recipients and people with HIV-AIDS). Our studies will improve our understanding of the contribution of a specific CMV protein to disease, thereby assisting efforts to reduce the impact of CMV infections."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Helen Farrell","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030627","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Farrell","source_individual_id":"5014571","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Helen Farrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84957","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Nicholas Davis-Poynter","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012654","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Davis-Poynter","source_individual_id":"5014228","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Nicholas Davis-Poynter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80128","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61752","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Validation of Cognitive Assessments using Telecommunication","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Cognition","Dementia","Multicentre","Telegeriatrics","Telemedicine"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456135,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Ageing and dementia","Alzheimer Disease","Cognitive assessment","Rural and remote health"],"scientific_title":"Validation of Cognitive Assessments using Telecommunication","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Leonard Gray","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456135","simplified_title":"Validation of Cognitive Assessments using Telecommunication","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"257261","source_system":"This project will assess the use of video conferencing to enable geriatricians to assess and diagnose memory problems including dementia. Establishing the reliability of diagnosis and other related assessments, and identifying which functions can confidently be carried out via video conferencing, is one step towards extending the availability of this service to rural and remote communities. Access to accurate diagnosis and assessment of cognitive impairment is an important step in the management of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other associated disorders. High level expertise, such as that offered by a specialist Memory Disorder Clinic, is particularly important if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, or if the prescription of cholinesterase inhibitors and associated medications are being considered. It was estimated that in 2005 there were 52,000 people diagnosed with dementia in Australia and by 2050 there will be an additional 175,000 cases each year. For the vast number of people who will be affected by dementia, early detection and intervention will play an important role in their healthy ageing experience. Access to accurate diagnosis and advice as a function of detection and intervention is often not as freely available to people in rural areas. The experience of travelling long distances for assessment can be detrimental to the emotional well being of people who may have dementia. Access to geriatrician services in a local rural area is an important element to maintaining their sense of well being. Geriatricians are not commonly available in rural areas which means current access to specialist diagnosis and assessment is either a missed opportunity or involves extensive travel. Internationally, there are many individuals living in remote regions with no access to geriatrician services, or reliable cognitive assessment.

This project is designed to investigate these processes using a specific genetic disorder as a model system. This disorder is called ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 or AOA2. This condition develops in the teenage to early twenties and as the name suggests is characterised by loss of control of gait together with difficulties of eye movement. It is due to reduced function of a particular region of the brain called the cerebellum responsible for controlling movement. We have initial data suggesting that cells from these patients are very sensitive to environmental chemicals and their capacity to carry out repair of damage to DNA is compromised. We will investigate the nature of the defect at the molecular level and establish the function of the protein defective in this syndrome.

Treatment for endometrial cancer involves removal of the uterus, tubes, ovaries and lymph nodes. Traditionally this has been performed by open surgery via an abdominal incision. Open surgery is effective for endometrial cancer, but it is highly invasive, resulting in visible scarring, tissue damage, blood loss and a fairly high risk of complications. Laparoscopic surgery, commonly referred to as keyhole surgery, is a new approach to removing the uterus, tubes, ovaries and lymph nodes. Preliminary results from this less invasive surgery have been extremely encouraging. Laparoscopic surgery is practical and safe in treating endometrial cancer, while also resulting in less tissue damage, lower blood loss, less pain and a shorter recovery period in hospital. The LACE study aims to give definitive answers about the results offered by laparoscopic surgery in treating women with early stage endometrial cancer. The primary aim is to investigate whether the treatment of endometrial cancer using laparoscopic surgery is as good as that using open surgery. Secondary aims look at whether laparoscopic surgery provides more benefits compared to open surgery for endometrial cancer, such as: - improvements in the quality of life post-surgery, - reduced number of early and late surgery-related complications, - shorter stays in hospital, - fewer blood transfusions required, - less pain post-surgery, and hence fewer pain-killers. The LACE study is already under way, with recruitment on target for Stage 1. This application seeks funding for Stage 2, to expand recruitment from 2007. The outcomes of the trial will have a significant bearing on the future choice of treatment for endometrial cancer.

Many of these children with burn injuries will heal burn wounds with unsightly scars and impaired skin function. Cooling burns as first aid has been used since ancient time and is proved to be the most effective way to reduce skin temperature, lessen pain, minimize the depth of injury, and ultimately improve wound healing outcome. However, despite the evidence that cooling burns using ice water <4 C may be beneficial to burns, current first aid recommend to only use cold water 8-25 C and the use of ice-ice water is strongly discouraged for fear of the potential to cause hypothermia and deepen the existing burn injury. In this application we will examine the effect of ice-ice water 2 C on wound healing outcome compared to 15 C water as first aid, in an in vivo model. The wound healing will be clinically assessed by experienced clinicians weekly for six weeks, and then will also be assessed histologically and mechanically at week six. We will also determine the optimal cooling temperature and duration for injured tissue in burn wounds to recover and the conduction of cold through skin. With the coming new knowledge we wish to design an optimal cooling burn treatment which will maximize the beneficial of cooling to the burns but avoid adverse effect of excessive cooling. The success of this project will advance our knowledge on first aid treatment or burn cooling treatment and also wound healing process.

These defensive functions require extensive trafficking of proteins within the macrophages. Protein trafficking is orchestrated in part by a family of membrane fusion proteins called SNAREs. By defining the relevant SNAREs, we have recently discovered a much acclaimed and novel pathway that allows efficient, combined cytokine secretion and phagocytosis in macrophages. Our studies proposed here will now expand on this discovery by comparing the phagocytic process, in terms of SNARE-mediated membrane and cytokine trafficking, for a wide range of microbes, highlighting differences that could provide new avenues for drug development. Moreover, since our strategy of using SNAREs to investigate and map trafficking pathways has proven so successful, we will now launch a major large-scale initiative to study ALL SNARE-mediated trafficking pathways in macrophages using a discovery pipeline of assays, including live cell imaging, we have developed. This will provide valuable information on many SNAREs including those associated with disease, and will elucidate trafficking pathways governing all macrophage actions in immunity, including cytokine secretion and antigen presentation. All of these pathways are highly relevant to current drug targets being used clinically or studied in inflammatory disease and for the development of vaccines."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Stow","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004860","middle_name":"Lea","last_name":"Stow","source_individual_id":"RMIS42387","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Stow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78016","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61744","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular Profiling of Breast Tumour Stem/Progenitor Cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["breast cancer","epigenetics","microarray","molecular genetics","stem cells"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456084,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["breast cancer","cell growth/differentiation","genomics","molecular basis of disease"],"scientific_title":"Molecular Profiling of Breast Tumour Stem/Progenitor Cells","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Sunil Lakhani","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456084","simplified_title":"Understanding breast tumour stem cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"308824.25","source_system":"Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women in many countries including Australia, the USA and the UK. The incidence of breast cancer has been increasing over the last decade however mortality from breast cancer has declined. Although there is debate as to the exact reasons for this decline in mortality, it is clear that the introduction of the screening program as well as improvements in treatment have played a significant role. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients will have disseminated disease at presentation and may not fully respond to treatment. In addition a number of patients will go on to form apparent recurrence of the primary tumour and- or distant metastases following what appears to be complete clearance of a tumour. In recent years a new concept has been put forward that might account for some of these recurrences. It is thought that the cells in a tumour do not all divide at the same rate. Instead some cells only divide rarely, and then give rise to other cells which divide rapidly and form the bulk of the tumour. Since these 'tumour stem cells' are slow cycling they will be resistant to existing chemotherapy because this affects rapidly dividing cells. These resistant cells may then go on to form another tumour. We intend to study these 'tumour stem cells' using a range of techniques that will show us how they differ from both the rest of the tumour cells and the different types of normal cells in the breast. By identifying molecules that are different in the tumour stem cells we will then have new targets for therapies that are designed to target these chemotherapy-resistant cells. Such therapies could be used in the future in conjunction with existing therapies to achieve a greater eradication of breast tumours."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Stratton","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034086","middle_name":"Rudolph","last_name":"Stratton","source_individual_id":"RMIS4440053","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Stratton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85821","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Peter Simpson","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033829","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Simpson","source_individual_id":"5017520","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Peter Simpson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85762","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sunil Lakhani","data":{"first_name":"Sunil","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026113","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lakhani","source_individual_id":"5015822","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Sunil Lakhani"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83752","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Catherine Clarke","data":{"first_name":"Catherine","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012352","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Clarke","source_individual_id":"RMIS3660947","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Catherine Clarke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80043","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61743","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Noncoding RNAs as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer","data":{"media_summary":"cancer staging","end_year":2009,"keywords":["breast cancer","cell differentiation","differential gene expression","microarray"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456080,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["breast cancer","breast cancer diagnosis","breast development","cancer biology","cancer staging"],"scientific_title":"Noncoding RNAs as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetics not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof John Mattick","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456080","simplified_title":"Noncoding RNAs as predictive markers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"550283.42","source_system":"Normal human development involves a symphony of genetic changes that control the growth and differentiation of different types of cells during embryogenesis. For many years it has been assumed that most genetic information is transacted by proteins, and that the remaining 98% of the human genome that does not encode proteins was (apart from a limited amount of associated regulatory elements) largely non-functional evolutionary junk. However, this may not be the case. Recent results from our laboratory and others have shown that most of our genome and that of other mammals is actually expressed as noncoding RNA, which appears to be developmentally regulated. These RNAs (of which there appear to be tens of thousands, well outnumbering the protein-coding mRNAs) have been referred to as the hidden layer or dark matter of our genome, as they have barely been studied, but appear to play a central role in both normal and abnormal development in humans. There is now increasing evidence that many noncoding RNAs, including small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs, are perturbed in cancer and that these perturbations may be directly involved in, and be an accurate indicator of, cancer state and the direction of cancer progression. If this is true we need to understand the expression and functions of these RNAs in order to develop better diagnostics and perhaps powerful new therapeutics for cancer, based on RNA technology and generic delivery systems. This project will explore the patterns of noncoding RNA expression in normal breast development and in breast cancer, to identify those RNAs that direct or accompany the differentiation of these tissues, and to test the effects of interfering with their expression on these processes. These foundation studies lie at the leading edge of a new understanding of human genetics and cancer, and will provide a platform for future applications in medicine that utilize this information and understanding."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Melissa Brown","data":{"first_name":"Melissa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041312","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS511711","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Melissa Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87712","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mattick","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014777","middle_name":"Stanley","last_name":"Mattick","source_individual_id":"5016273","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof John Mattick"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80700","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61742","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Novel peptides for the treatment of pain","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Chronic pain","Drug design","Neuropathic pain","Therapeutics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456074,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Biochemistry-protein peptide","Chronic pain and analgesia","Neuropathic pain","Novel therapeutic"],"scientific_title":"Novel peptides for the treatment of pain","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Craik","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456074","simplified_title":"New drugs for pain treatment","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"303828.39","source_system":"Chronic pain affects 1 in 5 Australians and neuropathic pain is among the most severe forms of chronic pain.

One of these, conotoxin MVIIA, has recently been approved in the US and Europe and others, including CVID and ACVI, are in various stages of clinical investigation. These small disulfide rich peptides share the attractive features of peptides in general of having exquisite selectivity for particular receptors, but also share the general disadvantages of peptides of short biological half-lives and poor bioavailablility. Stabilisation of these conotoxins has the potential to substantially increase their therapeutic potential. In preliminary studies we have shown that by introducing a circular petide backbone into a conotoxin using a linker sequence we can increase its stability and resistance to enzymatic degradation. We therefore propose that it will be possible to cyclise a wide range of conotoxin molecules and thereby improve their drug like properties. In this project we will use our cyclisation approach to develop new potential treatments for pain from two classes of conotoxins.

However, there are still a number of hurdles that need to be overcome before this source of promising pharmaceuticals can fulfil their vast potential. One of the biggest challenges in the development of peptides and proteins as drugs is overcoming their poor stability in the human body. The broad aim of this research proposal is to develop a novel strategy that provides therapeutically promising peptides and proteins the ability to resist the body s natural degradation pathways so they are able to reach their biological target. To develop this strategy we will use the recently discovered peptide hepcidin as a model system. Hepcidin is the major iron-regulatory hormone in the human body and incorrect levels of this hormone result in either iron overload (haemochromatosis), when there is not enough hepcidin produced by the body, or anemia of inflammation when there is too much hepcidin. The development of hepcidin-based therapeutic agents to treat these conditions has the potential to have significant impact as it has been estimated that up to 1 in 300 Australians are affected by haemochromatosis during their lifetimes. Unfortunately, unmodified peptides, like hepcidin, are of limited therapeutic value due to their poor stability within the human body. This research proposal describes the development of stabilised hepcidin analogues with the potential of being useful drug leads for the treatment of haemochromatosis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Craik","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041813","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Craik","source_individual_id":"5011504","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Craik"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87851","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Richard Clark","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029966","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Clark","source_individual_id":"5013970","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Richard Clark"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84761","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61740","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Inhibitors Of West Nile Virus Protease As Antiviral Drugs","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["enzyme inhibition","flavivirus","protease inhibitors","virus replication"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456061,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["drug discovery","drug target","protease","viral infection"],"scientific_title":"Inhibitors Of West Nile Virus Protease As Antiviral Drugs","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Fairlie","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456061","simplified_title":"Studying ways to block a viral enzyme to treat a viral infection spread by migratory birds","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"590740.52","source_system":"The West Nile Virus (WNV) was first isolated from a woman in the West Nile region of Uganda in 1937.

WNV is endemic in people in the Middle East, parts of Africa and Europe, but recent epidemics in Israel (1998), Romania (1996), United States (1999), and UK (2003), that have been traced to migratory birds, were characterized by severe symptoms , severe neurological pathology, and fatalities. In the USA alone there were 4,156 infections and 284 deaths in 2002, 9122 infections and 223 deaths in 2003, and this mosquito borne virus has quickly spread since 1999 through all USA states and into Canada and Mexico (http:--www.cdc.gov-ncidod-dvbid- westnile-index.htm). No treatments or vaccines are available. This project focuses on a viral enzyme, known as the West Nile Virus NS3 protease, that is essential for replication of the virus. By studying the enzyme in the laboratory we can design small molecules that block its function and these are potential leads for developing drug treatments for people infected, not only by this virus but potentially also other flaviviruses. A precedent is the success of inhibitors of HIV-1 protease that are the most effective treatment for humans with HIV-infections, and other viral proteases are now becoming recognized as viable antiviral targets for pharmaceutical development. The project involves experts on small molecule protease inhibitor design and development, proteases, and virology including West Nile virology.

Complement proteins are natural substances in human blood that protect against infection and injury by causing inflammation which is a desirable component of the immune response. One of these complement factors known as C5a is now thought to be a pivotal component of the complement system of human blood proteins that are synthesized during immune defence against infection. However when C5a is overexpressed or left unregulated it can lead to inflammatory diseases and is now throught to be a key factor in disease progression. In other work, we have been investigating the blockade of various human complement proteins (C5a, C3a, MAC), resulting in a number of new small molecules that can selectively affect, and allow us to probe their specific importance in, the human immune response. This project seeks to develop new compounds (suitable for development into drugs) that can block the binding of C5a to its receptor on the surface of immune cells, thereby preventing the pro-inflammatory actions of C5a. Such compounds have the potential to be new classes of antiinflammatory drugs that treat disease progression rather than just the symptoms of disease. We have previously created the first small molecule antagonists that helped to establish the importance of human C5a in inflammatory disease.

In this project, we will explore how these cells can be used to turn off the harmful cells present in the immune system."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Raymond Steptoe","data":{"first_name":"Raymond","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028164","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Steptoe","source_individual_id":"5017706","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Raymond Steptoe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84270","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Tony Kenna","data":{"first_name":"Tony","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025943","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Kenna","source_individual_id":"RMIS4441078","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Tony Kenna"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83692","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61735","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of the commissural plate and its role in forebrain commissure development","data":{"media_summary":"neurodevelopmental disorders","end_year":2009,"keywords":["abnormal embryogenesis","brain development","human foetuses","magnetic resonance imaging","neuroanatomy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456027,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["birth defects","clinical embryology","developmental brain disorders","mental retardation","neurodevelopmental disorders"],"scientific_title":"Development of the commissural plate and its role in forebrain commissure development","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Foetal Development and Medicine","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Linda Richards","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456027","simplified_title":"Midline brain development","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"529565.08","source_system":"During development, neurons in one hemisphere of the brain connect and communicate with neurons in the opposite hemisphere. Such neural connections between the two hemispheres are called commissures, which are large bundles of axons (neural-wires) that cross the midline of the brain. There are three commissures in the forebrain: the corpus callosum, the hippocampal commissure and the anterior commissure. This wiring of the brain is essential to its proper function. When these connections don't form, the brain cannot integrate and process information in fundamental ways. Over 50 different human congenital disorders are associated with the malformation of one or more of these forebrain commissures. This proposal investigates the hypothesis that a midline structure, called the commissural plate (CP), regulates the development of all forebrain commissures. The CP was first described anatomically at the turn of the 20th century in a number of different species, and in humans in 1968. However, since this time, no papers have been published on the CP. Experiments in this proposal will use modern neuroanatomical techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, molecular and mouse mutagenesis techniques, and axon guidance assays, to study the CP. We will test the hypothesis that there is something fundamentally unique about the CP as the midline crossing point for all commissural axons. We generate mouse mutants that disrupt only dorsal CP formation and then determine whether the subsequent development of the dorsal commissures occurs. We also perform molecular expression, and imaging analyses on human foetal brains. Our goal is to provide an understanding of what developmental events are disrupted in human congential disorders resulting in midline brain malformations and agenesis of the forebrain commissures. Understanding the basis of these disorders will lead to more accurate diagnoses and potentially their prevention through genetic counseling."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Linda Richards","data":{"first_name":"Linda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015855","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Richards","source_individual_id":"RMIS3266050","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Linda Richards"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80994","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61734","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of Netrin-DCC in the development of the corpus callosum","data":{"media_summary":"neurogenetics","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Axon guidance","Molecular neuroscience","Neural development","Neuron-glia interactions"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456026,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["brain development","embryonic development","genetic defect","neurodevelopmental disorders","neurogenetics"],"scientific_title":"The role of Netrin-DCC in the development of the corpus callosum","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Linda Richards","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456026","simplified_title":"Molecular mechanisms regulating brain wiring","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"512065.08","source_system":"During embryonic development neurons send out axons that connect to other target neurons within the brain. The proper connectivity of these axons is vital to brain function. The largest axon tract in the brain is called the corpus callosum and connects neurons in the left and right cerebral hemispheres. When the corpus callosum does not form, significant cognitive, motor and sensory deficits occur in patients. This condition, known as agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), is associated with over 50 different human congenital syndromes. Thus understanding how the genes and molecules involved in the formation of the corpus callosum function in normal development can provide the basis for our understanding of what goes wrong in ACC. In this proposal we will investigate the role of the axon guidance molecule Netrin1, and its receptor DCC, in development of the corpus callosum in both a mouse model and in humans with malformations of the corpus callosum. Although Netrin1-DCC signalling has traditionally been associated with mechanisms of axon guidance, we hypothesize that these molecules may play a different role, specifically in cellular adhesion and ultimately in the fusion of the two cerebral hemispheres, in a manner that allows the corpus callosum to form. A second role for Netrin1-DCC signalling may be in the guidance of these axons once the midline has fused correctly and we investigate this in Aim 2 of the proposal. Finally, we are collaborating with a paediatric neurologist at UCSF, who has identified several mutations in the DCC gene in patients with ACC. In Aim 3 we test whether these mutations disrupt the function of DCC in callosal axon pathfinding. Understanding how these genes function during development of the brain and how their function may be altered in ACC is crucial to providing a proper diagnosis and prognosis for these patients. Ultimately, understanding more about how these genes function could also lead to prevention of these disorders."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Linda Richards","data":{"first_name":"Linda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015855","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Richards","source_individual_id":"RMIS3266050","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Linda Richards"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80994","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61733","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The contribution of dopamine to regulation of orofacial, limb and trunk control: System or function specific effects?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Parkinson's disease","motor control","movement disorders","physiotherapy","speech pathology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":456017,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Parkinson's disease","motor speech disorders","movement disorders","physiotherapy"],"scientific_title":"The contribution of dopamine to regulation of orofacial, limb and trunk control: System or function specific effects?","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rehabilitation and Therapy: Hearing and Speech","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Bruce Murdoch","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/456017","simplified_title":"Regulation of orofacial, trunk and limb muscle systems","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"493124.25","source_system":"Treatment for Parkinson's disease, including dopamine replacement therapy and deep brain stimulation, fail to produce the same beneficial effects on all movement systems.

We believe that the normal repair mechanisms of the liver lead to the production of liver cells to replace those that have died, but in some circumstances also produce small bile ducts that drain bile from the hepatocytes. These small bile ducts may have a previously unsuspected role in stimulating the scar formation. The study will see if the small bile ducts are produced in a range of liver diseases in humans, and will use rodent models to find the factors responsible for stimulating the scarring.

Cryptococcus neoformans and the closely related species Cryptococcus gattii are the leading causes of life-threatening fungal meningitis, and Australia is one of the few countries where both species are prevalent. Although C. neoformans is an increasingly common cause of infection in immunocompromised patients such as those suffering from AIDS, approximately one in four infected individuals has no apparent immune system defect. For patients with AIDS, in the absence of antiretroviral therapy cryptococcal infection is incurable and requires lifelong treatment with antifungal medication to keep the infection in check. During infection, Cryptococcus is under tremendous stress enforced not only by the immune system and the presence of antifungals, but also by the high temperature, nutrient limiting environment encountered in the host. The proposed research will reveal how Cryptococcus evolves in this environment to enable persistence of infection despite medical intervention. I propose that naturally occurring mobile genetic elements present in the Cryptococcus genome cause chromosomal rearrangements during long term infection to produce gene deletions and duplications that facilitate survival. By characterising these changes and the genes associated with them, the research will identify novel genes involved in pathogenesis and will increase our understanding of the infection process. The expected outcome of this project is a detailed understanding of the roles mobile element movement and chromosomal rearrangement play in Cryptococcus during infection, and how these affect genes that contribute to the pathogenic process. The fundamental knowledge gained from this study will facilitate studies designed to combat infections in the clinical setting, provide new drug targets and help foster the development of more effective therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr James Fraser","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007343","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Fraser","source_individual_id":"RMIS4444550","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr James Fraser"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78685","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61727","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"CDK4 activity in S/G2 phases influences mitotic fidelity","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["UV radiation","cell cycle","melanoma","mitosis","transcriptional regulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455977,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["melanoma","skin cancer","sunlight exposure"],"scientific_title":"CDK4 activity in S/G2 phases influences mitotic fidelity","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

There is evidence to suggest that only some prostaglandins are involved in inflammation, so the risk of side effect can be reduced by blocking the production of only a small set. One prostaglandin, prostaglandin D2, is known to cause many characteristics of allergic asthma and may also contribute to osteoarthritis, although the evidence for this is contradictory.

The latter is determined both by the virulence properties of the organism and by the genetic makeup of the host. This large, extracellular pathogen is eradicated from the body predominantly by acavenger (phagocytic) cells, which are also important in determining the severity of the associated tissue lesions. A phagocytic cell that is central to both innate and adaptive immune responses is the macrophage, which not only takes up and kills the yeast, but also is capable of of killing and digesting it, and presenting the components to cells of the adaptive immune system. This project is based on the postulate that the outcome and severity of infection is determined, at least in part, by the early functional response of the macrophage to the overall virulence properties of the yeast. The response is initiated by interactions with cell-surface receptors, and this study will show that a novel macrophage receptor, Mincle, is an important part of the innate immune response to fungal infections. We have shown that it is associated with differences in susceptibility to yeast infections in inbred mouse strains; it can discriminate between different isolates of the yeast; and it initiates the inflammatory signalling cascade. Our project will define the specific role of this receptor in fungal infection. The results will be important in understanding the basic biology of host resistance, and will offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention by selectively blocking or modifying different activation pathways."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christine Wells","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040397","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Wells","source_individual_id":"5018258","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Christine Wells"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87466","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Robert Ashman","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029217","middle_name":"Brian","last_name":"Ashman","source_individual_id":"5013239","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Robert Ashman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84574","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61721","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of bone-associated macrophages in bone remodelling and bone disease","data":{"media_summary":"osteoporosis","end_year":2009,"keywords":["bone","immunopathology","monocyte/macrophage differentiation","osteoblast","osteoclast"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455941,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["bone formation","bone growth and fracture healing","bone resorption","macrophage activation","osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Role of bone-associated macrophages in bone remodelling and bone disease","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Allison Pettit","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455941","simplified_title":"Bone macrophages contribute to bone remodelling and disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"564963.89","source_system":"Musculoskeletal diseases, including osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, are a national and international health and research priorities.

Early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of many musculoskeletal diseases are currently inadequate. Consequently, there is a high demand for effective treatment options. This project grant application proposes a novel line of scientific investigation that will provide greater understanding of the contribution of macrophages (a cell type that has important roles in normal tissue maintenance and defense against infection) in bone remodelling and disease. Bone is continuously remodelled and replaced to maintain skeletal strength and mineral metabolism. We have shown that a population of macrophages is intimately associated with bone and propose that these cells play an important part in regulating bone remodelling. Macrophages have been implicated in many diseases that have damaging consequences on bone, including osteoporosis and several forms of arthritis, linking aberrant macrophage function to disease-associated bone damage. This project aims to characterize this population of bone-associated macrophages and determine their ability to influence the function of other cells integrally involved in bone remodelling. We will also undertake studies in animal models to determine whether these cells are required for bone remodelling and-or damage. Detailed description of the novel role of macrophages in bone biology will facilitate the development of superior therapeutics, preventatives and cures for bone diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Liza Raggatt","data":{"first_name":"Liza","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015741","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Raggatt","source_individual_id":"RMIS4437738","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Liza Raggatt"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80966","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Allison Pettit","data":{"first_name":"Allison","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015560","middle_name":"Robyn","last_name":"Pettit","source_individual_id":"5016963","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Allison Pettit"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80923","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"David Hume","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0013804","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hume","source_individual_id":"RMIS29671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David Hume"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80420","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61720","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Ambulatory fetal activity monitoring predicts clinical outcome","data":{"media_summary":"pregnancy","end_year":2009,"keywords":["fetal development","fetal growth","obstetrics","pregnancy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455935,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["fetal health","fetal mortality","fetal well-being","mortality","pregnancy"],"scientific_title":"Ambulatory fetal activity monitoring predicts clinical outcome","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Colditz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455935","simplified_title":"Detection of fetal activity","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"397236.68","source_system":"A small number of babies die unexpectedly while still in the womb: the numbers are much higher than those dying from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

It would be very helpful to be able to accurately monitor babies' movements in the womb so that we could help the few babies who need it, and so prevent poor outcomes. Mothers feel their babies moving, but it's often hard for them to pick up all the movements that do occur. The best way of measuring babies' movements is during an ultrasound. However, that's expensive and means that the pregnant mother needs to lie still for about half an hour to have this testing done. We are developing a way of recording babies' movements, which still lets the pregnant woman continue with her normal activities. We will do this using an AMBULATORY FETAL ACTIVITY MONITOR, which is an accelerometer, like an advanced pedometer. The ambulatory fetal activity monitor will measure the activity of the unborn baby during pregnancy, looking at the number of times s-he moves and how simple or complex the movements are. We expect that the unborn baby who is not getting enough nutrition during the pregnancy will have fewer movements than other unborn babies. This project involves checking that movements picked up by the ambulatory fetal activity monitor are the same as movements seen on an ultrasound. We will then monitor a large number of pregnant women with healthy and possibly unhealthy babies, to help identify the babies who need help.

This effect is mediated by the production of prostaglandins both in peripheral tissues and in the spinal cord. Prostaglandins have recently been shown to decrease the magnitude of the inhibitory neurotransmission that normally occurs onto pain sensing neurons in the spinal cord. This has the effect of raising the excitability of these neurons, thereby making it easier for weak pain stimuli to be relayed to the brain. Inhibitory neurotransmission onto pain sensing neurons is largely mediated by the alpha3 glycine receptor subunit that is not found anywhere else in the body. Very little is known about the physiological and pharmacological properties of these receptors. We hypothesise that drugs that increase the activation of alpha3 glycine receptors may provide a novel treatment for pain. This project will firstly identify new drugs that can increase the activation of these receptors. It will then test whether these drugs are likely to work in vivo. The project will also establish why these receptors are found only on pain neurons. Together, this information will establish whether alpha3 glycine receptors represent a promising new therapeutic target for inflammatory pain, and will place us in an excellent position to begin the next step of identifying novel therapeutic lead compounds."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Joseph Lynch","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032228","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Lynch","source_individual_id":"5016080","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Joseph Lynch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85342","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61718","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"identification of clinically significant subtypes of head and neck cancer cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["keratinocytes","squamous cell carcinoma","tumour stem cells","tumourogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455929,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["head and neck cancer","minimal residual disease","squamous cell carcinoma"],"scientific_title":"identification of clinically significant subtypes of head and neck cancer cells","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Nicholas Saunders","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455929","simplified_title":"Do head and neck cancers contain cancer cells that behave differently","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"469122.18","source_system":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region (HNSCC) is amongst the top 10 most prevalent cancers. It is a life threatening cancer that is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 40%. Whilst most patients are treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy a significant fraction of patients relapse and eventually succumb to the cancer. The molecular basis for relapse in these patients is still unknown. One possible explanation for treatment failure is the notion that the cancer contains biologically distinct subtypes of cancer cells. Some these cells may respond to therapy whilst a small fraction of cells may not. If this small fraction of resistant cells were able to divide and repopulate the tissue then this would provide an explanation for relapse in these patients. However, as yet no such data has been available to support this argument. Most recently, studies with another cancer called acute myelocytic leukaemia has shown that they do contain a small subtype of cancer cells that are resistant to therapy and can regenerate the disease in patients. These cells have been called tumour initiating cells (TIC). In this application we will use patient tumour samples to try to isolate TICs from HNSCC. We will first determine whether these TICs exist and whether they express markers of normal human stem cells. We will also test whether these TICs are more resistant to chemotherapeutics or radiation than the rest of the tumour cells. In addition we will enrich for these TICs and identify new protein markers that could be used to test patient samples before or after treatment. This would be of considerable assistance in making decisions about treatment choice or prognosis. Since TICs have not been reported in HNSCC previously their identification would lead to a considerable advance in our undesratnding of how these tumours form."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Nicholas Saunders","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021953","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Saunders","source_individual_id":"5017363","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Nicholas Saunders"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82651","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Pritinder Kaur","data":{"first_name":"Pritinder","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002563","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kaur","source_individual_id":"RMIS222159","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Pritinder Kaur"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77368","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61717","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Evaluation of factor Va from the venom of the Australian Brown snake as a topical and systemic anti-bleeding agent","data":{"media_summary":"Traumatic injury","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Biochemical pharmacology","Coagulation protein","Drug development","Protein characterization","Venom"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455925,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Biochemistry protein and peptide","Coagulation","Drug discovery","Haemostasis","Traumatic injury"],"scientific_title":"Evaluation of factor Va from the venom of the Australian Brown snake as a topical and systemic anti-bleeding agent","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Martin Lavin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455925","simplified_title":"An anti-bleeding agent from snake venom","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"113742.6","source_system":"Anti-bleeding agents are important pharmaceuticals for use in truama, surgery and several medical conditions to reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusion.

There is evidence that this disruption results in isolation and poor communication between family members, anxiety, low self-esteem and school problems for siblings and anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms and risk of depression for parents. Providing ongoing support to these families is an essential part of care. The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) Paediatric Oncology Service in Brisbane is the major tertiary paediatric referral centre for Queensland, northern New South Wales and the southwest Pacific. A multidisciplinary team of medical, nursing, and allied health professionals provides care and support to children with cancer, as well as their families. Each year around 100 newly diagnosed patients are cared for. Around 60% of the families cared for by the service live in regional and remote areas. There are a number of challenges which inhibit the equitable provision of specialist health services to these areas including availability of health care professionals and accessibility due to distance, time, cost and transport. For paediatric oncology families, opportunities to receive support are limited. One possible solution is the use of online support mechanisms, such as videotelephony, to facilitate the provision of much needed support to patients, parents, siblings and the family as a whole. The objective of this research is to see if videotelephony can be used to support regional and remote families of the Royal Children's Hospital Paediatric Oncology Service providing indizidualised communication, education, counselling and monitoring. This will present a new and innovative use of videophone technology as well as a new method for supporting regional and remote oncology patients and their families."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Trevor Russell","data":{"first_name":"Trevor","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0033555","middle_name":"","last_name":"Russell","source_individual_id":"RMIS3678636","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Trevor Russell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85687","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Hallahan","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025279","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Hallahan","source_individual_id":"RMIS4434868","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Hallahan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83510","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Wootton","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023093","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wootton","source_individual_id":"5018481","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Richard Wootton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82948","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Deborah Theodoros","data":{"first_name":"Deborah","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022512","middle_name":"Gale","last_name":"Theodoros","source_individual_id":"RMIS15273","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Deborah Theodoros"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82794","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Helen Irving","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002372","middle_name":"","last_name":"Irving","source_individual_id":"RMIS3678642","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Helen Irving"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77312","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61714","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cellular Activation and Apoptosis in Response to Foreign Cytoplasmic DNA","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cell death/apoptosis","innate immunity","interferon","transfection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455920,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["gene therapy","infectious diseases","systemic lupus erythematosus","viral infection"],"scientific_title":"Cellular Activation and Apoptosis in Response to Foreign Cytoplasmic DNA","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Katryn Stacey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455920","simplified_title":"A novel pathway for detection of viral DNA","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"496446.74","source_system":"Viruses are simple organisms. They grow within cells, needing host cell proteins for their replication. Viruses have only a few proteins of their own, and evolve rapidly to change these. It is therefore challenging for the immune system to identify viral infections. Recently it has been recognised that the genetic material of viruses (DNA or RNA) is detected by the immune system. A novel pathway for recognition of viral double stranded DNA is emerging. The genetic material of mammalian cells (DNA) is found within the membrane-bound nucleus of the cell. The presence of DNA outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm is abnormal, and is detected as an indication of viral infection. This causes either death of the cell, or activation to produce anti-viral molecules. We have identified a protein from the cytoplasm of cells which binds specifically to DNA. This protein, X is found in association with foreign DNA within 5 minutes of it being introduced into the cell. In this project we propose to confirm that X recognises foreign DNA and initiates cellular activation or death. Other molecules to which X binds during this process will be identified. This project is relevant to a number of problems in health and disease as well as biotechnology. In both gene therapy and biotechnology, DNA is introduced into cells in order to allow those cells to make specific proteins. The cell sees the introduced DNA as a potential viral infection, and it responds in ways which limit the production of the desired proteins. Lupus is an autoimmune disease with high levels of DNA in circulation. X is proposed as a protein involved lupus in mouse models. We suggest that DNA taken up by cells is recognised by X and this contributes to the disease. Understanding the means by which DNA is recognised in the cytoplasm may allow the development of much more efficient processes for gene therapy and protein production in biotechnology, and more effective lupus and antiviral therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Katryn Stacey","data":{"first_name":"Katryn","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028117","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Stacey","source_individual_id":"5017656","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Katryn Stacey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84258","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Tara Roberts","data":{"first_name":"Tara","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015901","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Roberts","source_individual_id":"5017199","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Tara Roberts"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81007","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"David Hume","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0013804","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hume","source_individual_id":"RMIS29671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David Hume"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80420","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61713","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Clinical impact of clonal Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis","data":{"media_summary":"spread of infection","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection","cross-infection","cystic fibrosis","epidemiology","respiratory infection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455919,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection","cystic fibrosis","epidemiological monitoring of pathogens","respiratory infections","spread of infection"],"scientific_title":"Clinical impact of clonal Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Scott Bell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455919","simplified_title":"Epidemic Pseudomonas infection in patients with cystic fibrosis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"547238.45","source_system":"In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the normal defence mechanisms are compromised by an inherent genetic fault which results in an extremely sticky and dehydrated mucus. The respiratory system is unable to eradicate microbes (infection) from the lungs of patients with CF which begin to multiply and cause infection and inflammation. Recurring infections are treated with multiple courses of antibiotics and frequent hospitalisation and eventually result in premature death. This study focuses on the major bacterial problem, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several studies from Australia and the UK, including our own have shown that about 30% to 45% of patients share the same strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within a centre. We know that two dominant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are found in CF centres on the eastern board of Australia. This is unexpected as this bacterium is usually acquired from the environment. The emergence of these clonal strains is causing increasing anxiety in the CF community. This study is designed to provide vitally needed information on the clinical implications of being infected by an clonal strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the risk factors for the acquisition of an clonal strain. This new information will provide a rationale basis for the need for changes to infection control policies (including patient segregation), better outcome predictors for patients infected with clonal strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Bye","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041404","middle_name":"Thomas Patrick","last_name":"Bye","source_individual_id":"5013727","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Bye"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87738","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Scott Bell","data":{"first_name":"Scott","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029395","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Bell","source_individual_id":"RMIS15775","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Scott Bell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84618","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Philip Robinson","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021767","middle_name":"","last_name":"Robinson","source_individual_id":"5011983","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Philip Robinson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82599","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Guy Marks","data":{"first_name":"Guy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014706","middle_name":"Barrington","last_name":"Marks","source_individual_id":"RMIS5596","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Guy Marks"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80679","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Barbara Rose","data":{"first_name":"Barbara","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0009963","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rose","source_individual_id":"RMIS3083058","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Barbara Rose"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79403","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Colin Harbour","data":{"first_name":"Colin","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007722","middle_name":"","last_name":"Harbour","source_individual_id":"5015070","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Colin Harbour"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78789","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61712","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular Characterization of E. coli that cause Urinary Tract Infection","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["adhesion mechanisms","bacterial pathogen","virulence"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455914,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["bacterial virulence factors","biofilm","microbiology - pathogenesis","urinary tract infection"],"scientific_title":"Molecular Characterization of E. coli that cause Urinary Tract Infection","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Mark Schembri","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455914","simplified_title":"Molecular Characterization of E. coli that cause Urinary Tract Infection","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"387114.92","source_system":"The long term goals of the proposed research are to understand the processes by which uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) cause acute, recurrent and chronic infections and to identify new UPEC targets for therapeutic intervention. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common infectious diseases of humans and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In the USA, UTI accounts for more than 1 million hospitalizations and $1.6 billion in medical expenditures each year. It is estimated that one in four women and one in twenty men will develop a UTI in their lifetime. The recurrence rate is high and no treatment other than antibiotics (often inefficient) is currently available. UPEC are the primary cause of UTI. In the last grant period, we focused on the molecular interplay that exists between different surface adhesins of UPEC. We succeeded in demonstrating functional interference between adhesins, motility organelles, aggregation factors and the capsule. We also discovered and partially characterized several novel UPEC adhesins that may play a role in pathogenesis. We established two novel technology sets: a mouse model of ascending UTI and the flow chamber biofilm model. In the next grant period, we will build on these concepts and experimental systems to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying UPEC virulence. We will characterize the role of several novel UPEC surface proteins in cell adhesin, aggregation, biofilm formation and colonization of the mouse urinary tract. We will employ an integrated approach that combines a powerful bacterial genetic system, a biofilm model, a mouse UTI model, microscopy and tissue culture systems to reveal the cellular, molecular, and structural basis for the pathogenesis of UTI. The work will facilitate the development of new vaccine approaches to prevent UTI, such as novel mechanisms for strain attenuation and vaccine design.

People who have osteoporotic fractures experience a diminished quality of life and a reduced life expectancy. Although there are currently a number of therapies in use to reduce further loss of bone in osteoporotic patients, there is only one to replace lost bone, parathyroid hormone. For clinical and economic reasons, there is a need for additional bone-building therapies. Like all tissues, the nervous system affects skeletal function. We recently discovered a powerful control pathway by which the nervous system regulates bone formation. This project will test whether altering the function of this neural pathway can increase bone formation and whether it can work together with parathyroid hormone therapy to produce an enhanced bone formation response greater than either therapy alone. This research is important because of the need for new osteoporosis therapies to repair weakened bones.

Testing by our laboratory suggests that the new virus is related to picornaviruses (which cause some common colds) but seems to be present in children with far more serious illness. Our study plans to more completely identify the new picornavirus-like virus (PLV) using the tools of molecular biology and the expertise of a senior team of Australian scientists and clinicians who have recently made several virus discoveries in Australia, demonstrating that Australian virus research is capable of achieving highly competitive results that benefit our hospitals and especially their young patients. Our studies will develop extremely sensitive tests which rely on the detection of very small amounts of the viral genome. We can use these tests to determine what the whole virus looks like, when it might occur during the year and whether the PLV are found worldwide. Our studies will also produce viral proteins in the laboratory and use these to make new tests for stored blood samples. If a blood sample comes from a patient who has previously been infected by PLV, their blood will contain specific antibodies which we will then be able to detect. We also intend to determine whether some strains of PLV are more or less likely to cause serious illness than others. Improved understanding of these and other viruses minimises the chance of illness spreading within a hospital, helps scientists to decide against which viruses to design vaccines and drugs and aids medical doctors to better identify what once went undiagnosed."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephen Lambert","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026122","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Lambert","source_individual_id":"RMIS682186","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephen Lambert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83757","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ian Mackay","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020546","middle_name":"Maxwell","last_name":"Mackay","source_individual_id":"5016124","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Ian Mackay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82250","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Theo Sloots","data":{"first_name":"Theo","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016277","middle_name":"Pieter","last_name":"Sloots","source_individual_id":"5017574","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Theo Sloots"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81115","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Nissen","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009388","middle_name":"Desmond","last_name":"Nissen","source_individual_id":"5016723","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Nissen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79252","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61709","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Gene therapy to cure botulinum toxin intoxication and new motoneuron delivery system","data":{"media_summary":"synaptic mechanisms","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Gene therapy","motor function","nerve regeneration","nervous system repair","neuromuscular diseases"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455903,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["SNARE proteins","botulinum toxin","gene therapy","neuromuscular junction","synaptic mechanisms"],"scientific_title":"Gene therapy to cure botulinum toxin intoxication and new motoneuron delivery system","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biotechnology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"BIOTECHNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Frederic Meunier","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455903","simplified_title":"Gene therapy for treatment of botulism","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"390321.74","source_system":"The aim of the project is to establish two biotechnological strategies to help curing motoneuronal diseases. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the deadliest toxins known. They provoke profound flaccid neuromuscular paralysis that leads to death due to respiratory failure. There are no current therapies available and affected patients require respiratory assistance for up to 7 months with sophisticated respirators. BoNT is therefore an acquired motoneuronal disease and a well-known biological weapon which is also easy to produce in large quantities. It is therefore important to provide a quick and efficient way of overriding BoNT-induced paralysis other than very costly mechanical respirators. Our first strategy aims at designing a gene therapy against botulism. BoNTs promote muscular paralysis by cleaving molecules implicated in the mechanism of neuronal communication (SNARE proteins). Our aim is to deliver genetically modified uncleavable forms of SNAREs to rescue neuronal communication and prevent botulism. BoNT are comprised of two chains: a toxic light chain and a non toxic heavy chain which is responsible for the extreme selectivity of BoNT for motoneurons and for delivering the light chain in the motoneuronal cytosol by a mechanism named translocation. Our second aim is to use the BoNTs atoxic heavy chain to engineer a selective motoneuronal delivery system.

MS affects about 2 million people worldwide, with the onset of disease often between 20-40 years of age, at a time when family and work commitments are often at their peak. There is no cure for MS, and most people who develop this disease become more and more disabled over their lifetime. MS is an autoimmune disease, i.e. one's own immune system starts to see the CNS as something foreign that needs to be targetted and eliminated. Previously, it has been considered that there are no particular reasons why people with MS develop lesions in the specific parts of the CNS that they do, i.e. it has been thought to be a fairly random event. However, we have recently shown that there are clear correlations between the development of lesions in some parts of the CNS, the particular molecules within the CNS that are being targetted by the immune system, and some genes that control the immune system that are carried by people with MS. The aim of the current study is to work out the mechanism(s) by which autoimmune reactivity targets lesions to different parts of the CNS. We will focus on one target molecule known as myelin proteolipid protein or PLP. People with MS who carry certain immune-related genes are more likely to have immune cells that target PLP, and our work strongly suggests that this subsequently leads to the development of lesions in the brainstem or cerebellum. This work has implications for disease pathogenesis, prognostication and therapy for MS, as a knowledge of patterns of autoimmune reactivity that lead to particular clinical outcomes will improve our ability to give people with MS an idea of they symptoms they might experience and allow specific therapies to be given to patients who will benefit most from them."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Judith Greer","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0036976","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Greer","source_individual_id":"RMIS24768","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Judith Greer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86571","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Pender","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009604","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Pender","source_individual_id":"RMIS18293","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Pender"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79308","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61705","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Non-viral vectors for targeted delivery of RNAi nucleotides to cervical cancers","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Cancer","RNA interference","cervical cancer","gene delivery","nanoparticles"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455890,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["anti-tumour agents","cervical cancer","genetic therapy","human papilloma virus/cervical carcinoma"],"scientific_title":"Non-viral vectors for targeted delivery of RNAi nucleotides to cervical cancers","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Nigel McMillan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455890","simplified_title":"Delivery of gene-silencing nucleotides","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"415738.45","source_system":"RNA interference (or gene silencing) is a new technique whereby we are able to turn off the expression of a particular gene either temporarily or permanently.

Cervical cancer is caused by infection with the human papillomavirus and the expression of two cancer-causing genes. Using RNA interference we can turn off the expression of these two genes which results in the death of the cancer cell. We are also able to cure mice of tumours derived from human cervical cancer.

We have shown that even in Queensland, the so-called Sunshine State, vitamin D levels in the middle of winter are below World Health Organisation recommended levels. We are exploring low maternal vitamin D as a biological explanation for the universal phenomena worldwide of a 7-10% increase in the incidence of patients born with schizophrenia in the colder months of the year. Schizophrenia is a developmental disease that presents in adolescence and affects about 1% of the world's population. To date we have shown increased amounts of schizophrenia in offspring from mothers that had low blood vitamin D levels during pregnancy or who had inadequate vitamin D intake. Early signs therefore appear promising but obviously more research is required to confirm this idea. Our studies in animals have revealed that by restricting vitamin D intake in pregnant rats, newborns have brains that develop differently. Most notably lateral ventricle volume is increased, a key anatomical finding in patients with schizophrenia. When these animals become adults the increase in lateral ventricles persists. Also when we explore the behaviour of these animals we find a deficit in learning and memory similar to that seen in many schizophrenic patients. Furthermore when we expose these animals to agents that induce psychosis or agents that block psychosis in patients we see a heightened sensitivity in animals that were deprived of this vitamin in utero particularly in locomotion. These behavioural findings are consistent with the best animal models for schizophrenia. At a mechanistic level they indicate an abnormality in the two major neurotransmitters in the brain that have been consistently linked with this disease, dopamine and glutamate. The experiments outlined in this application will attempt to establish the neurochemical basis for these altered behaviours."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Darryl Eyles","data":{"first_name":"Darryl","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042305","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Eyles","source_individual_id":"5014564","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Darryl Eyles"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87979","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Thomas Burne","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023865","middle_name":"Henry Johnston","last_name":"Burne","source_individual_id":"5013713","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Thomas Burne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83125","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mcgrath","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009022","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Mcgrath","source_individual_id":"RMIS3680751","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mcgrath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79147","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alan Mackay-Sim","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003102","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mackay-Sim","source_individual_id":"RMIS222290","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alan Mackay-Sim"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77528","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61703","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation and Function of TLR9","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cell surface receptor","innate immunity","macrophage activation","toll-like receptor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455882,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["infectious diseases","systemic lupus erythematosus","vaccination"],"scientific_title":"Regulation and Function of TLR9","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Katryn Stacey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455882","simplified_title":"How cells recognise bacterial DNA","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"256973.37","source_system":"Cells of the immune system need to recognise characteristic viral and bacterial molecules, in order to identify infection. Some immune cells can detect the presence of viral and bacterial DNA. The cells respond by making a number of anti-viral or anti-bacterial molecules, as well as activating other cells to fight the infection. The effect of bacterial DNA can be mimicked by certain short synthetic pieces of DNA. The potent activity of this synthetic DNA (termed CpG DNA ) is being exploited in a number of clinical trials for treatment of cancer and allergy, as well as to improve vaccinations. Despite the rapid advance towards clinical application, there is still much basic information to learn about how CpG DNA acts on cells. The molecule to which DNA binds in order to activate the cells is called TLR9. TLR9 is not on the surface of cells, but within cells. In a bacterial infection, cells called macrophages engulf and digest bacteria and release the bacterial DNA within the cell, where it binds to TLR9. In other cases, including when CpG DNA is used therapeutically, the DNA needs to be taken up into the cell. Evidence shows that there is a receptor on the cell surface which binds DNA, and takes it into the cell. In this project we propose to identify this DNA uptake receptor. Apart from the use of CpG DNA, there are a number of other proposals for the therapeutic use of DNA. Although it is known that DNA enters into cells, the route for this has not been established. Whilst CpG DNA can activate immune cells, some other distinct DNA molecules can prevent the activation. We will examine whether these inhibitory DNA molecules bind more effectively to TLR9 than the CpG DNA, but do not activate the cell. These inhibitory molecules are proposed as a therapy for the autoimmune disease lupus, which involves inappropriate responses to DNA, and is thought to involve TLR9. In order to develop therapies, a detailed knowledge of how they work is essential."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthew Sweet","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028255","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Sweet","source_individual_id":"5017818","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthew Sweet"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84300","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Katryn Stacey","data":{"first_name":"Katryn","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028117","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Stacey","source_individual_id":"5017656","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Katryn Stacey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84258","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61702","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neonatal vitamin D status and risk of schizophrenia: a study using Danish dried bloods spots","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["brain development","schizophrenia","vitamin D"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455879,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["hypoxia and malnutrition during pregnancy","schizophrenia aetiology","vitamin D deficiency"],"scientific_title":"Neonatal vitamin D status and risk of schizophrenia: a study using Danish dried bloods spots","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof John McGrath","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455879","simplified_title":"Neonatal vitamin D status and risk of schizophrenia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"164980.2","source_system":"There is increasing evidence that low levels of vitamin D (i.e. the 'sunshine hormone') during early development can alter brain development. In particular, it has been proposed that low vitamin D during development (e.g. prenatal and in early life), increases the risk of developing schizophrenia during adulthood. A previous study based on stored third trimester blood samples from US women suggested that very low levels of maternal vitamin D may be associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. We have the opportunity to explore this hypothesis using a large, well-described Danish 'bio-bank'. Since 1981, blood samples from newborn babies have been kept by a central agency in Denmark. In collaboration with senior Danish medical researchers, 900 blood samples of babies who have subsequently developed schizophrenia and 1800 from matched healthy individuals have been identified. We will measure vitamin D levels in these blood samples. We predict that babies with low levels of vitamin D will have an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. If low prenatal vitamin D does increase the risk of schizophrenia, this finding will have important implications from a public health perspective. Just as the number of infants affected by spina bifida has been reduced by adding folate supplements to foods, optimizing maternal vitamin D levels may lead to a reduction in the incidence of schizophrenia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Darryl Eyles","data":{"first_name":"Darryl","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042305","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Eyles","source_individual_id":"5014564","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Darryl Eyles"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87979","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Preben Mortensen","data":{"first_name":"Preben","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026883","middle_name":"Bo","last_name":"Mortensen","source_individual_id":"5020603","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Preben Mortensen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83960","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mcgrath","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009022","middle_name":"Joseph","last_name":"Mcgrath","source_individual_id":"RMIS3680751","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mcgrath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79147","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61701","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Evaluation of a group intervention to promote older people's adjustment to driving cessation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Ageing","Community participation","Driving cessation","Older people","Transport"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455876,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Ageing","Chronic disease","Older people","Transport"],"scientific_title":"Evaluation of a group intervention to promote older people's adjustment to driving cessation","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Louise Gustafsson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455876","simplified_title":"Helping older people give up driving","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"350755.03","source_system":"As a result of age-related changes, chronic medical conditions, the side-effects of medication or a combination of these, many older people decide or are required to give up driving.

The international biomedical community has invested very heavily in infrastructure to aid the zebrafish community in realising the potential of this model. In Australia we have very strong basic research teams whom have embraced zebrafish mdoels. However, we lag behind other parts of the world in that, as yet, we have not had much specific funding allocated to animal model infrastructure.

stored inside cells in spherical structures called lipid droplets. The accumulation of fat within lipid droplets underlies obesity. This project aims to understand how fat is stored within lipid droplets and how it is released when energy is required. In particular, we will look at two types of protein which move to lipid droplets under certain energy conditions and attempt to unravel how these proteins control fat storage and release. The first protein we will study, caveolin, normally associates with regions of the cell surface but moves to lipid droplets when cells are fed lipids. Mice which lack this protein eat more food but remain leaner than normal mice. Understanding how caveolin moves to lipid droplets and how it controls fat accumulation will therefore provide new insights into obesity and conditions associated with obesity, such as diabetes. The second protein to be studied, Rab18, is a member of a protein family which controls membrane movement within cells. Rab18 moves to lipid droplets when lipid release is stimulated. Therefore studies of Rab18 can provide new insights into the way lipids are released from fat tissue under conditions of starvation. The project will provide fundamental new insights into the basic mechanisms by which we store energy and the energy imbalances which cause obesity and related diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Parton","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027233","middle_name":"Glenn","last_name":"Parton","source_individual_id":"5016875","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Parton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84038","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Sally Martin","data":{"first_name":"Sally","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0003208","middle_name":"","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"RMIS6515","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Sally Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77555","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61698","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The nuclear growth hormone receptor- its actions and mechanism of nuclear translocation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["apoptosis","growth hormone","proteomics","receptors","transport"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455864,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["cancer and related disorders","growth disorders","retinopathy"],"scientific_title":"The nuclear growth hormone receptor- its actions and mechanism of nuclear translocation","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael WATERS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/455864","simplified_title":"Role of the growth hormone receptor in the cell nucleus and how it gets there.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"531696.74","source_system":"We and others have found that cell surface receptors for growth factors such as EGF, FGF and growth hormone can be found in the nucleus of proliferating cells.

To create more effective inhibitors of this tumourogenesis, and to define the physiological roles of nuclear GH receptor, we will define the transport process which carries the receptor to the nucleus and block it. We will also seek to define how the receptor in the nucleus interacts directly with DNA to inhibit programmed cell death. To carry out these projects we will use sophisticated proteomics -mass spectrometry to identify the proteins interacting with the receptor in the transport and gene activation processes. The role of candidates will be tested by preventing their expression or by direct inhibition of their action using drugs or dominant negative versions.

There is evidence that the disease involves an inflammatory component, but available anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective. We have developed a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs, known as C5a antagonists, and in preliminary experiments have shown they are therapeutically effective in a transgenic rat model of motor neurone disease.

NRs are hormone-dependent DNA binding proteins that translate nutritional and pathophysiological signals into gene regulation. The importance of this 'drugable' gene family in the context of promoting and maintaining human health is underscored by the diversity of medicinals associated with dysfunctional hormone signalling, in the context of inflammation, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and endocrine disorders (e.g ~15% of the top selling therapeutic compounds target NRs). The NR4A subgroup are stress response genes which are induced by a wide range of physiological stimuli and have been implicated in the response to energy excess (over-eating) and diet induced obesity. The NR4A subgroup are expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass peripheral tissue that accounts for ~40% of the body mass and energy expenditure. This lean tissue is a major site of fat oxidation, insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and cholesterol metabolism. Therefore this tissue plays a notable role in insulin sensitivity, the blood lipid profile, and energy balance. Accordingly, muscle has a significant role in the progression of dyslipidemia, diabetes and obesity.

Nevertheless, given the data on NR4A mediated gene regulation, and the potential therapeutic utility for the treatment of metabolic disease, the contribution of skeletal muscle to NR4A action must be defined.

Such cell-to-cell adhesion is mediated by the cadherin family of molecules, which reside on the surfaces of cells. Cadherins allow cells to recognize one another and, upon recognition, to adhere to each other. By this means, populations of individual cells can be linked together into cohesive populations - i.e. the tissues and organs of the body. The importance of cadherin adhesion is exemplified by the fact that disruption of cadherin adhesion contributes to many important diseases, especially inflammation and cancer. Thus understanding how cadherins hold cells together is necessary for us to understand the molecular basis of common diseases. In this project we study how cadherins signal to regulate cellular behaviour. We build on our recent discovery that E-cadherin can activate a lipid in the cell membrane, PIP3, that is known to be a key regulator of many cellular activities. We aim to understand how this signal is generated in response to E-cadherin adhesion and how it elicits normal cellular responses to cadherin adhesion."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alpha Yap","data":{"first_name":"Alpha","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034891","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yap","source_individual_id":"5018525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alpha Yap"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86044","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61686","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Developmental Genes;","cancer","craniofacial development","limb development","murine models"],"nhmrc_grant_id":455823,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

Affected patients persistently ignore objects, sounds or touches on the side of space opposite their brain injury. This disorder occurs despite normal sensory function, and reflects damage to the brain's internal representations of one side of space, causing patients to behave as if that side of space no longer exists. Spatial neglect is difficult to rehabilitate and is a major predictor of poor functional recovery after stroke, but there are no effective treatments for it. A promising new treatment for spatial neglect has been recently discovered, which involves patients practicing pointing to a visual target while wearing spectacle-mounted prism lenses that systematically correct for their altered view of the world. Following a brief period of this training, patients' show increased ability to perceive visual objects presented to the previously neglected side of space. Studies have shown that the prism treatment can have long-term benefits for many neglect sufferers. However, it is not known what the brain mechanisms underlying the treatment effects are, and to what degree the effects generalize to all affected senses. The proposed project aims to investigate whether prism treatment ameliorates spatial neglect of sounds as well as visual objects in a group of stroke patients. The project will also systematically examine which part of the brain is critical for the beneficial effects of prism treatment by using focal magnetic stimulation to create reversible, virtual lesions in the brains of healthy participants. Addressing these issues has clear implications for identifying suitable candidates for the treatment, and for understanding how the sensory world is represented in the human brain."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Dexter Irvine","data":{"first_name":"Dexter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025708","middle_name":"Robert","last_name":"Irvine","source_individual_id":"RMIS8519","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Dexter Irvine"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83618","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jason Mattingley","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020682","middle_name":"Brett","last_name":"Mattingley","source_individual_id":"RMIS123930","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jason Mattingley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82287","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ranmalee Eramudugolla","data":{"first_name":"Ranmalee","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012918","middle_name":"","last_name":"Eramudugolla","source_individual_id":"RMIS4488926","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ranmalee Eramudugolla"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80201","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61495","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and positive inotropic effects of ghrelin and GHRP on rat and mouse cardiac myocytes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Apoptosis","Calcium","Fibroblast proliferation","Ion channels","Signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":441113,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Cardiac fibrosis","Cardiac hypertrophy","Heart failure","Myocardial infarction"],"scientific_title":"Anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and positive inotropic effects of ghrelin and GHRP on rat and mouse cardiac myocytes","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Synthetic GH-releasing peptides (GHRPs) and endogenous GHRP (ghrelin) possess many other physiological functions in addition to the release of GH. GHRPs have been shown to affect cardiac function in animals and humans through their specific receptors. We recently demonstrated at single cell level that GHRPs increased contraction of cardiac muscle cells and protected them from the programmed cell death which occurs in heart failure and myocardial infarction. We also demonstrated that GHRPs protected the heart in chronic heart failure and alleviated functional loss of the heart in experimental heart failure models. Preliminary results now indicate that GHRPs prevent cardiac fibrosis, which accounts for cardiac dysfunction after heart failure and infarction. It is proposed in this project to clarify the mechanism underlying the action of GHRPs in (1) cardiac functional enhancing; (2) anti-cell death; (3) anti-fibrosis effects, in primary cultured rat myocytes in vitro and in cardiac diseased mouse models in vivo. By completing this project, we will be able to (1) better understand the physiological role of ghrelin in the regulation of cardiac function; and (2) clarify the potential for therapeutic use of GHRPs in the treatment of chronic heart failure, a disease affecting 1-2% of the population of Australia, with 5 year mortality rates about 65%."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Morag Young","data":{"first_name":"Morag","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040647","middle_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"Young","source_individual_id":"5018554","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Morag Young"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87533","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Chen Chen","data":{"first_name":"Chen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024065","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chen","source_individual_id":"RMIS86822","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Chen Chen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83170","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61326","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Australian Mouse Brain Mapping Consortium","data":{"media_summary":"neurological diseases","end_year":2012,"keywords":["brain imaging","immunohistochemistry","magnetic resonance imaging","neuroanatomy","transgenic animals"],"nhmrc_grant_id":436673,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["brain disease","mental illness","mental retardation","neurodegenerative disorders","neurological diseases"],"scientific_title":"Australian Mouse Brain Mapping Consortium","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Reutens","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Enabling Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436673","simplified_title":"Australian Mouse Brain Mapping Consortium","sub_type":"Enabling Grant","total_budget":"2009462.12","source_system":"We propose to establish the Australian Mouse Brain Mapping Consortium which is a national network of facilities allowing Australian researchers to better characterise mouse models of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and stroke.

It causes our blood vessels to constrict, makes us thirsty, and induces salt and fluid retention via an effect on the kidneys, thereby increasing blood pressure. In some cardiovascular diseases, the generation of angiotensin II or our sensitivity to this hormone is elevated. It is therefore crucial that we understand how angiotensin II works and how its actions in the body are mediated. For angiotensin II to act it must first bind to a receptor. Receptors are proteins and behave like locks that are opened by the hormone keys. Thus, cellular receptors for angiotensin II are engaged and activated by increases in angiotensin II in our blood. These receptors then produce signals which initiate a response (e.g. constriction of a blood vessel). Subsequently, the receptors are switched-off to prevent over-stimulation. The experiments proposed in this application continue our investigations into how angiotensin II receptors are switched-on and -off. A major way for receptors to be turned on is for them to interact with other cellular proteins, although we know only some of these interactions for the angiotensin receptor. Receptors are turned off by being ear-marked by a modification known as phosphorylation; these modified receptors are then bound by proteins termed arrestins, which as indicated by their name, play a role in preventing further receptor signalling. These arrestins also help to remove activated receptors from the cell surface to the inside of the cell. This application proposes new technologies to investigate the spectrum of proteins recruited to the angiotensin receptor and the role of arrestins in switching receptors on and off. Results from these studies will further our understanding of angiotensin II receptors and their role in cardiovascular control."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Walter Thomas","data":{"first_name":"Walter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028371","middle_name":"Glen","last_name":"Thomas","source_individual_id":"RMIS225046","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Walter Thomas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84337","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61007","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Equipment"],"nhmrc_grant_id":467203,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Mr Michael Tse","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/467203","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"669769","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr Michael Tse","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016724","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tse","source_individual_id":"RMIS4747161","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr Michael Tse"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81243","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60907","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Assessment to Service Outcomes - Care pathways for older Australians with Dementia, CVD and Arthritis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["CVD system and diseases","Health policy evaluation","Health related to ageing","Nervous system and disorders","Skeletal system and disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":410002,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Assessment to Service Outcomes - Care pathways for older Australians with Dementia, CVD and Arthritis","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Health Economics","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"ECONOMICS","cia_name":"Prof Stephen Duckett","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Strategic Awards","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/410002","simplified_title":"Care Pathways for Older Australians","sub_type":"Health Services Research","total_budget":"656029.2","source_system":"The project aims to use existing data source to answer questions similar to �What happens to people after they have been assessed and recommended for aged care?� in respect of service delivery for people with one of the three chronic conditions dementia, arthritis or cardiovascular disease.

Two separate longitudinal research projects, the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women�s Health involving over 12,000 older women selected from every part of Australia, and the Health in Men Study involving over 12,000 older men from Perth, Western Australia, have been following older Australians in order to determine what contributes to older people�s health and quality of life. The new project will combine data from these two studies. The two projects contain a breadth of data and can address the following questions: What health-related, personal, lifestyle and social factors predict survival and healthy non-disabled life in men and women aged 70-90 years? Do changes in lifestyle in older age (eg smoking cessation) affect length and quality of life? Who makes greatest use of health services, and who least, and how does this relate to health outcomes?How are health and lifestyle factors related to social connectedness and independent living in older age?

NR-associated disorders (e.g 16% of the top 100 drugs target NRs). ERRgamma receptors are abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass periperal tissue that acconts for ~40% of total body weight, and energy expenditure. Muscle is the major site of glucose metabolism and, fatty acid oxidation. Consequently, it has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, the blood lipid profile, lipid metabolism and obesity. Understanding the functional role of the orphan ERR receptors in skeletal muscle in the context of inflammation, lipid and energy homeostasis is of paramount importance in further understanding the mechanistic basis of dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, insulin sensitivity, diabetes and obesity. Identification of novel ERRgamma targets that regulate metabolism in a major mass peripheral tissue, and positively influence the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, provides platforms for potential therapeutic intervention.

Affected individuals suffer from a number of symptoms but the most serious is a chronic infect with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sustained lung inflammation caused by infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ultimately destroys the structure of the lung to the point where it can no longer function. Gene therapy has been suggested as a possible treatment for the disease but another approach is to identify the CF specific aspects of the inflammatory response and target those for therapeutic development. In our previous work we have identified several strong candidates for the inflammatory molecules in the CF lung and in this application we will test those candidates to see whether they play a major role in CF lung disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"David Hume","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0013804","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hume","source_individual_id":"RMIS29671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David Hume"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80420","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brandon Wainwright","data":{"first_name":"Brandon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010876","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Wainwright","source_individual_id":"RMIS3708556","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Brandon Wainwright"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79662","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60586","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Urinary tract E. coli: the good guys versus the bad guys","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["biofilm","gene regulation","pathogenesis","urinary bladder","vaccine development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401714,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["bacterial pathogenicity","bacterial virulence factors","biofilm contamination on instruments and implants","urinary tract infection"],"scientific_title":"Urinary tract E. coli: the good guys versus the bad guys","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Mark Schembri","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401714","simplified_title":"Urinary tract E. coli: the good guys versus the bad guys","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"296150.52","source_system":"Escherichia coli is the primary cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the developed world. In Australia alone, E. coli affects more than 250,000 yearly to the extent where they require medical intervention. It is estimated that one in four women and one in twenty men will develop a UTI in their lifetime and in the USA UTIs result in $1.6 billion in medical expenses each year. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains readily form biofilms on indwelling catheters and recent evidence suggests that they also form biofilm-like aggregates in the bladder. No treatment other than antibiotics (often inefficient due to resistance) is currently available. E. coli is also the most frequent cause of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). ABU occurs in up to 6% of healthy individuals and affects high risk groups such as the elderly and diabetics. In general, most patients with ABU do not need treatment and in many cases the colonizing organism actually helps to prevent infection by other more virulent bacteria. The aim of this project is to compare UPEC and ABU E. coli for differences associated with virulence and biofilm growth. The project will generate a comprehensive and defined strain bank relative to E. coli that cause UTI. Understanding biofilm growth by this organism may lead to the development of improved and-or novel treatments. Furthermore, increased knowledge of ABU E. coli is essential if we are to fully explore the possibility of employing these organisms as probiotic agents to prevent infection by other pathogens in specific high risk patient groups."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Per Klemm","data":{"first_name":"Per","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031803","middle_name":"","last_name":"Klemm","source_individual_id":"5015726","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Per Klemm"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85231","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Schembri","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016088","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Schembri","source_individual_id":"5017368","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Mark Schembri"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81054","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60585","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Altered hepatic pharmacokinetics as a consequence of drug- and disease-induced changes in hepatic vascularity.","data":{"media_summary":"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Cardiovascular disease","Liver disease","Modelling","Pharmacokinetics","Vasoactive drugs"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401702,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Atherosclerosis","Heart failure","Hypertension","Liver cirrhosis","Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis"],"scientific_title":"Altered hepatic pharmacokinetics as a consequence of drug- and disease-induced changes in hepatic vascularity.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Roberts","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401702","simplified_title":"Pharmacokinetics and liver vascularity.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"498088.1","source_system":"Many drugs are broken down by the liver or are removed from the liver out into the intestine by the bile, as well as being removed by the kidney and other organs.

Cardiovascular and liver diseases and certain drugs can affect both of these processes. This work is concentrating on those processes which mainly affect the uptake process. The diseases of most interest are liver cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis and chronic heart failure, all of which together are leading causes of death in Western countries. They are also associated with liver dysfunction due to effects on liver vessels. We have a poor understanding of how the effects of these diseases and a number of drugs on liver vessels affect the functioning of the liver, especially in terms of how they affect drug breakdown or removal of drugs.

Nas1 also controls sulfate excretion into the urine, by regulating kidney reabsorption. Normally, very little sulfate is lost in the urine. However, individuals with autism, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, motor neurone disease and liver cirrhosis, have been reported to have reduced blood sulfate levels. The mechanisms underlying the low blood sulfate levels in these disorders, have not been characterised. Recently, we generated a mouse lacking the Nas1 gene. This mouse has very low blood sulfate levels and suffers from growth retardation, reduced fertility and displays seizures. In this study, we plan to investigate these phenomena in the Nas1 knock out mouse and determine the role of low blood sulfate levels on these conditions. We also plan to characterise the role of low blood sulfate levels on the expression of genes in various body organs, using a gene array approach. In addition, we plan to study wound repair and the detoxification process in our Nas1 knock out mouse, which we expect to be affected due to low blood sulfate levels.

Recently, we have demonstrated that IMPDH also has a role in the formation of fat droplets within cells, when they are exposed to excessive nutrients. In mammals, excess consumed energy is stored as fat droplets within all cells. In fat cells, the energy is stored in very large droplets, and we see this as extra body fat. This is sometimes associated with an alteration in the hormone production of the cells, leading to problems such as diabetes. In other cells, the excess energy is stored as tiny fat droplets (lipid bodies) that can adversely affect the function of the cell. We have shown that blocking the action of IMPDH can interfere with the accumulation of fat in both fat cells and other types of cell. This suggests that IMPDH has an important role in the development of obesity and associated problems such as diabetes. In this study we aim to investigate in detail the role of IMPDH in the accumulation of fat droplets in cells. We will do this by looking at the effects of different forms of IMPDH in different cell types, including human fat cells. We will also study cells and animals with increased or decreased amounts of IMPDH, and investigate the effects of this on the development of increased fat stores and insulin resistance. These studies will increase our understanding of the role of IMPDH in the development of obesity, and may lead to identification of new avenues of treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jonathan Whitehead","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0046246","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Whitehead","source_individual_id":"RMIS5218572","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jonathan Whitehead"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88973","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Johannes Prins","data":{"first_name":"Johannes","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039181","middle_name":"Bernhard","last_name":"Prins","source_individual_id":"RMIS7041737","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Johannes Prins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87157","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60581","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"STAT5 as an anti-obesity agent","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["JAK-STAT pathway","gene knockout","growth hormone","leptin","obesity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401668,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease and hypertension","coronary heart disease prevention","diabetes (type 2)","obesity prevention"],"scientific_title":"STAT5 as an anti-obesity agent","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael WATERS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401668","simplified_title":"Transcription factor STAT5 controls obesity","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"505523.48","source_system":"An obesity epidemic is evident in first world countries including Australia.

This proposal seeks to establish an important new element in our understanding of the development of obesity, the transcription factor STAT5. With previous NHMRC support, we developed sophisticated genetically modified mice which lack defined signalling processes initiated by growth hormone, an anti-obesity agent. These studies showed a strong correlation between ability to activate STAT5 and resistance to obesity. There is fragmentary literature evidence to support our hypothesis, which could also explain some of leptins anti-obesity actions. Using mice which lack STAT5, we shall establish a role for STAT5 as an antiobesity agent. The actions of STAT5 are normally blocked by feedback inhibitors referred to as SOCS, discovered by Australians. We shall define which SOCS is the feedback regulator for obesity control, allowing us to develop specific anti-SOCS agents which will act as novel anti-obesity agents."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Waters","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022867","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Waters","source_individual_id":"RMIS47580","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Waters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82896","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60580","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["Axon guidance","Commissure","Corpus callosum","Cortical development","Glial development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401658,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurosciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Linda Richards","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401658","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"607101","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Linda Richards","data":{"first_name":"Linda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015855","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Richards","source_individual_id":"RMIS3266050","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Linda Richards"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80994","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60579","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification of new mutations that contribute to breast   cancer","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["BRCA1","Gene regulation","Genetic predisposition","Mutation screening"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401651,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Breast cancer","Familial cancer","Genetic testing","Therapeutic target"],"scientific_title":"Identification of new mutations that contribute to breast   cancer","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genome Structure","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Melissa Brown","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401651","simplified_title":"Understanding the genetic abnormalities that cause breast cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"323825.75","source_system":"Breast cancer affects approximately one in ten women and is therefore a major health problem.

As they comprise 2.7% of our population (502,000 Australians) - this situation is unjust and should be rectified. The barriers to good health for them include communication difficulties, impaired recall of significant health information, negative social attitudes and inadequate training about disability for health service providers. This project is an attempt to minimise some of these barriers by examining the use of a Health Intervention Package. We want to give young people with intellectual disabilty the chance of similar health standards to the rest of the population. This package includes a comprehensive health review, a diary for collecting and storing health information, and advocacy training. We specifically want to examine if adolescents with intellectual disabilty using this package will receive better healthcare and improved health outcomes. We envisage that if successful, the intervention will establish good health practices for the rest of the young person's life. This group of young people is particularly at risk as they move from care provided by specialist paediatricians to accessing General Practitioners' services. To achieve this, the study will seek to recruit 1000 young people (and their parents and teachers) in Special Schools in Queensland. We have already shown that the comprehensive health review does improve health outcomes adults with intellectual disabilty, and the health information and advocacy training has received very positive evaluation.

These problems are all linked to, or aggravate, the condition known as insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs when normal levels of insulin are insufficient to remove glucose from the blood. In the normal situation, insulin regulates glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells by stimulating the movement of a glucose transport protein from inside the cell to the cell surface. The trafficking of this protein is somehow disrupted in insulin resistance. The purpose of this research is to follow up our exciting preliminary results on this system to shed light on the molecular processes that regulate the trafficking of the glucose transporter. Information resulting from our studies will lead to a better understanding of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and may also unravel the details of a related cellular secretion system that regulates neurotransmission. Our hope is that by understanding at the molecular level how cells regulate secretion, we can in the future develop therapeutics to counteract many of today s major health problems."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Frederic Meunier","data":{"first_name":"Frederic","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020864","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Meunier","source_individual_id":"5016455","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Frederic Meunier"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82341","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David James","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019872","middle_name":"E","last_name":"James","source_individual_id":"RMIS8321","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David James"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82057","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Martin","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008922","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"5022915","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79117","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60576","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"E-Cadherin endocytosis in morphogenesis: recycling and growth factor induced uptake.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["adhesion molecules","endocytosis","epithelial cells","growth factors","protein trafficking"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401642,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["cancer biology","development","metastasis"],"scientific_title":"E-Cadherin endocytosis in morphogenesis: recycling and growth factor induced uptake.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Jennifer Stow","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401642","simplified_title":"E-Cadherin endocytosis in morphogenesis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"498088.1","source_system":"E-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion protein expressed in all epithelia with essential roles in establishing cell polarity and in tissue patterning during development. In the adult, E-cadherin functions to maintain epithelial integrity. E-cadherin is also a vital tumour suppressor, protecting cells against metastatic transformation. Our earlier studies showed that E-cadherin is constantly moved, or trafficked, to and from the surface of epithelial cells. The endocytosis or internalisation of cell surface E-cadherin serves to regulate its role in adhesion. More recently, we and others have shown that E-cadherin is endocytosed in response to growth factors, in conjunction with the activated growth factor receptors themselves. E-cadherin can influence the trafficking and signaling of these receptor tyrosine kinases. This joint endocytosis is an elegant mechanism for the simultaneous downregulation of cell adhesion and activation of signaling for cell growth and motility. The growth and differentiation of epithelial cells during tissue patterning or morphogenesis relies critically on these endocytic pathways. Our research is aimed at defining the endosomes and cellular machinery involved in E-cadherin-receptor endocytosis, moreover we will pursue initial findings suggesting that there are different pathways and fates for E-cadherin endocytosed at the behest of different growth factors. We will study endocytosis during the processes of epithelial cyst formation and tubulation of cysts as an in vitro model for mammalian morphogenesis. These studies will provide important and novel information for understanding the roles of E-cadherin in adhesion and in growth factor signaling during epithelial morphogenesis. Ultimately these findings will be of relevance to epithelial development and the prevention of cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Stow","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004860","middle_name":"Lea","last_name":"Stow","source_individual_id":"RMIS42387","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Stow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78016","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60575","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structural biology of endosomal membrane trafficking","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["membrane trafficking","protein complexes","structural biology","x-ray crystallography"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401626,"application_year":2005,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Structural biology of endosomal membrane trafficking","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Brett Collins","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401626","simplified_title":"Structural biology of endosomal membrane trafficking","sub_type":"RD Wright Biomedical CDF","total_budget":"462290","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Brett Collins","data":{"first_name":"Brett","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0041718","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Collins","source_individual_id":"5014007","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Brett Collins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87821","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60574","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of dendritic cell-induced T-cell tolerance","data":{"media_summary":"tolerance","end_year":2008,"keywords":["cellular immunology","dendritic cell","immune regulation","tolerance"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401620,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["autoimmune disease","cellular immunity","dendritic cells","immune regulation","tolerance"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of dendritic cell-induced T-cell tolerance","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Raymond Steptoe","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401620","simplified_title":"Mechanisms of dendritic cell-induced tolerance","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"314773.48","source_system":"Autoimmune diseases constitute a significant medical problem in the developed world and are increasing in incidence.

In over fifty different human congenital syndromes the corpus callosum fails to form properly. Such syndromes, which include Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndrome, Shapiro syndrome and Acrocallosal syndrome, can result in mental retardation, seizures, lack of motor coordination and ocular abnormalities in children. Our data on both mouse and human brain development show that the mouse is an excellent model system for understanding how the brain becomes wired up during development and what may go wrong in these disorders. Here we investigate the role of a family of genes called nuclear factor one (Nfi) genes in brain development. When mutated in mice, members of this gene family, principally Nfia and Nfib, cause severe malformations of the brain. The phenotype inlcudes a failure to form some midline glial populations, the expansion of the cingulate cortex and loss of the corpus callosum. The propoer formation of midline glial populations and the cingulate cortex are essential to callosal fomration and correct brain wiring. Defects in brain wiring in the cingulate cortex during development may underlie disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. In this project we will address the mechanism of function underlying the control of brain development by the Nfi genes. The expected outcomes of this research are to identify new mechanisms and genetic pathways critical to the formation of connections between the two sides of the brain and proper formation of the cingulate cortex. These results will improve our understanding of how the brain forms and what mechanisms may be disrupted during development that result in neurological and cognitive deficits in children and adults."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Linda Richards","data":{"first_name":"Linda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0015855","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Richards","source_individual_id":"RMIS3266050","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Linda Richards"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80994","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60572","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Adiponectin - Multimerization, Secretion and Action","data":{"media_summary":"Type 2 Diabetes","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Biochemistry","Cell biology","Cell surface receptor","Glycoproteins","Hormone signalling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401612,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Insulin Resistance","Liver","Metabolic syndrome","Obesity","Type 2 Diabetes"],"scientific_title":"Adiponectin - Multimerization, Secretion and Action","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Jonathan Whitehead","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401612","simplified_title":"Secretion and Action of Adiponectin","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"478844.91","source_system":"Adiponectin is a hormone produced by fat tissue.

Coronary heart disease (CHD; clogging of the coronary arteries), while secondary to atherosclerosis in most of the world, accounts for nearly 2 million deaths per year in Europe alone. In Australia CHD is the single leading cause of death. This project is aimed at developing lead molecules for the development of therapeutics capable of stimulating revascularization (that is, opening up blocked vessels to improve blood flow) of tissues with slow or retarded circulation. Such therapeutics would improve the treatment of atherosclerosis and CHD. Peptides, small proteins, are generally not stable enough to be used as drugs. In this project we plan to engineer protein molecules based on an unusually stable family of proteins, known as the cyclotides. We will chemically synthesise analogues of cyclotides that have been altered to incorporate the activities of less stable small peptides that are able to induce therapeutic angiogenesis.

This makes back pain the most common chronic pain in Australia and most prevalent disorder among the National Health Priority Areas. For the majority with recurrent and chronic problems, the cause is unknown but changes in control of the spine are thought to be important. It is well accepted that pain and injury to the low back affect the way that we control the back muscles and this leads to changes in spinal function. However, despite considerable investigation of this problem, there is a distinct lack of consensus for how the control of movement is changed during pain, why it changes, and whether these changes lead to further problems in the long term. The objective of this series of studies is to determine how the adaptation to pain changes the control of the spine. We will use a range of techniques that include tests of the strategies used by the brain to control the spine and mathematical models to estimate the effect that these changes have on the spine when people are given back pain by injecting sterile salty water into the back muscles. These studies will be backed up by measures of mechanical properties of the spine and by comparison to people with clinical pain. This combination of methods has not been used previously and is likely to help resolve the problem of how muscle control is chaged in back pain. We will also test a range of hypotheses regarding how pain has its effect on muscle activity. A final series of studies aims to determine whether the failure of these changes in muscle control to resolve after an epiosde of back pain leads to increased recurrence of pain in the long-term. The importance of this project is highlighted by the significance of back pain as a major health issue, the lack of consensus regarding the effect and mechanisms of pain on trunk muscle control (despite extensive investigation), and the potential for the findings to guide rehabilitation and management."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Hodges","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043077","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Hodges","source_individual_id":"RMIS222953","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Hodges"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88164","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jacek Cholewicki","data":{"first_name":"Jacek","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035863","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cholewicki","source_individual_id":"RMIS3161648","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jacek Cholewicki"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86290","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rob Herbert","data":{"first_name":"Rob","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031266","middle_name":"","last_name":"Herbert","source_individual_id":"RMIS5768596","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rob Herbert"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85093","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Graven-Nielsen","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013316","middle_name":"","last_name":"Graven-Nielsen","source_individual_id":"5028243","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Graven-Nielsen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80299","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof G.

E-cadherin is also a vital tumour suppressor, its normal function guarantees that cells or even early tumours cannot metastasise; in contrast E-cadherin is always lost or malfunctions in malignant tumours. Earlier studies showed that E-cadherin is constantly moved, or trafficked, to and from the surface of epithelial cells. This trafficking has dual roles, firstly in delivering newly-made E-cadherin to the surface where it functions and secondly, in regulating its adhesive function. Our research in this project is focussed on the molecules and intracellular compartments that control the delivery of E-cadherin to the cell surface. E-cadherin must be sorted in order to be delivered to the correct side of the cell. Having previously discovered the sorting signal in E-cadherin, we will now identify the cognate adaptor protein(s) that accomplish this sorting. New imaging techniques allow us to study protein trafficking inside live cells. Such studies have recently revealed that E-cadherin passes through a recycling endosome compartment on its way to the cell surface. This unexpected route, and the structure and role of the recycling endosome will now be studied in detail in live cells. Finally we will compare the sorting and trafficking of E-cadherin with the closely-related N-cadherin protein, to determine whether there are inherent differences in their trafficking that could explain their opposite roles in tumour cells, where N-cadherin is substituted for E-cadherin and allows metastatic behaviour. These studies will provide important information for understanding the adhesive and tumour suppressive roles of E-cadherin. In addition our findings will generate information fundamental to our understanding of cell polarity and protein sorting."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Rohan Teasdale","data":{"first_name":"Rohan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040022","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Teasdale","source_individual_id":"5017848","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Rohan Teasdale"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87368","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Stow","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004860","middle_name":"Lea","last_name":"Stow","source_individual_id":"RMIS42387","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Stow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78016","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60564","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of central and peripheral synaptic activity in the developmental death of motoneurons.","data":{"media_summary":"Neuronal cell death","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Developmental motoneuron death","Glycinergic , GABAergic transmission","Neural Development","Neuromuscular junction","Neuronal death"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401579,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Motor neuron disease","Nervous system development","Nervous system disorders","Neuromuscular diseases","Neuronal cell death"],"scientific_title":"The role of central and peripheral synaptic activity in the developmental death of motoneurons.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Peter Noakes","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401579","simplified_title":"How synaptic connections made onto motoneurons regulate motoneuron death during embryonic development.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"463145.08","source_system":"Information processing in the nervous system relies on the effective communication between neurons and their target cells which make up our neuronal circuitry. At the centre of all this is the synapse, the specialized contact between a neuron and its target cell, be it another neuron in the brain or a target organ such as skeletal muscle. Our primary goal is to determine how the formation of synaptic connections during development regulates neuronal survival. In this proposal we have focussed on the neuromotor system as it is a well characterised part of the nervous system. During development, 50% of motoneurons die at a time when they are making contact with skeletal muscle, and when contacts onto motoneurons by other neurons are being established. We believe that the formation of effective synaptic contacts onto motoneurons, as well as connections by motoneurons onto muscle are the key regulators of motoneuron survival. We are in a position to be able to address what regulates motoneuron death; as we have a number of mice which lack key molecules needed for the formation of specialisations that allow neuronal contacts to be made between motor neurons and their muscle, and with other neurons within the spinal cord. By examining the function of motoneurons, counting them and screening for molecular changes in these mice, we will be able to dissect out the mechanism of how a motoneurons' fate is determined during developmental motoneuron death. This research could help in developing strategies aimed at improving neuronal connections to improve neuronal viability. Our research will have important implications for our understanding about the basis of adult neuro-degenerative diseases, such as motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's, which are in part characterised by a molecular breakdown in neuronal connections that ultimately result in neuronal death."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Noakes","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038807","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Noakes","source_individual_id":"5016732","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Noakes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87053","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Mark Bellingham","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035336","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Bellingham","source_individual_id":"5013441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Mark Bellingham"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86159","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60563","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"NR1 nuclear hormone receptors, and skeletal muscle metabolism: insights into dyslipidemia and metabolic disease.","data":{"media_summary":"obesity","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Fatty Acid and Lipid Metabolism","Gene Regulation","Skeletal Muscle","Steroid (and Nuclear) Hormone Receptors","Transcription"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401573,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["biological Sciences","cardiovascular diseases","dyslipidaemia","endocrine Disease","obesity"],"scientific_title":"NR1 nuclear hormone receptors, and skeletal muscle metabolism: insights into dyslipidemia and metabolic disease.","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof George Muscat","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401573","simplified_title":"Hormonal regulation of fat metabolism in muscle","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"582547","source_system":"The significance of Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) in disease is underscored by the range of pharmacopoeia for the treatment of NR-associated disorders (e.g 16% of the top 100 drugs target NRs).

Muscle is the major site of glucose metabolism and, fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, it is an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and HDL levels. Consequently, it has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, the blood lipid profile, lipid metabolism and obesity. Understanding the functional role of the orphan NR1 receptors in skeletal muscle in the context of inflammation, lipid and energy homeostasis is of paramount importance in further understanding the mechanistic basis of dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, insulin sensitivity, diabetes and obesity.

We have already described how Epo can protect the kidney, but no one has yet described its action on kidney cell differentiation or its effect on structural and vascular support in the injured kidney. When might Epo treatment be effective? Could it protect against chronic renal disease? Likewise, whilst more very pre-term babies survive, this is a crucial period when they are at heightened sensitivity to lack of oxygen and they are at risk of brain damage and poor development because of lack of maturation of key structural cells in the brain. The role of Epo in aiding brain cell maturation and on blood vessel formation and function in this faulty development period is not known. Both of these health problems are major issues causing huge costs to society both financial and emotional. Despite the early evidence of a useful role for Epo in human disease treatment, current experimental and clinical data demonstrate the importance of further thorough investigation of mechanisms and cellular pathways that will underpin improvements in clinical outcomes.

They also occur in horse and greyhound racing, often resulting in euthanasia of the animals involved. They incur considerable costs in medical expenses, time lost from sport and interruption to military training. But, there is almost no information on the mechanism of healing of these fractures. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are still the most widely used medication in management of musculoskeletal injuries, yet their effect on healing of stress fractures is unknown. NSAIDs delay fracture healing, but until recently there has been no standardised way of studying stress fractures. We have created, for the first time, a well-characterised, non-invasive model of stress fractures in the forearm of rats that closely resembles the clinical situation. This provides a novel and unique opportunity to determine the histological and molecular mechanism of stress fracture healing, and to investigate effects of antiinflammatory-analgesic medications on this process. Rats will have an experimental stress fracture produced in one forelimb, and its healing will be examined up to ten weeks using microscopic investigation and analysis of the genes that are turned off or on to initiate the process. Groups of rats will also be treated with antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, specific COX-2 inhibitors and a new class of drugs that target early immune responses called C5a receptor antagonists. The analgesic Paracetamol will also be investigated as an alternative to the NSAIDs described above. There is widespread use of anti-inflammatory agents in managing stress fractures, so it is vital that their effects on stress fracture healing be examined. This project has enormous significance for optimising approaches for clinical management of stress fractures and for understanding the interaction of anti-inflammatory or analgesic agents in that process."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Julia Kuliwaba","data":{"first_name":"Julia","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014287","middle_name":"Suzanne","last_name":"Kuliwaba","source_individual_id":"5015797","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Julia Kuliwaba"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80557","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Forwood","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007324","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Forwood","source_individual_id":"RMIS18701","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Forwood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78676","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari","data":{"first_name":"Nicola (Nick)","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007214","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Fazzalari","source_individual_id":"RMIS5831069","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicola (Nick) Fazzalari"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78651","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60557","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Excitotoxic Mechanisms in Alcoholic Brain Damage","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Gene Expression","Glutamate Receptors and Transporters","Human Brain Damage","Neurotransmission","Pathogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401551,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["Alcohol Abuse and Dependence","Liver Cirrhosis","Neuropathology"],"scientific_title":"Excitotoxic Mechanisms in Alcoholic Brain Damage","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Peter Dodd","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401551","simplified_title":"How Alcohol Misuse Damages the Human Brain","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"387892.61","source_system":"Brain damage resulting from long-term alcohol abuse is localized to discrete regions of the brain and selectively impairs key neuropsychological functions. Alcohol misuse affects processes that control excitability in the brain, leading to the over-stimulation of brain cells. When this continues for long periods the cells are likely to die and most alcoholics misuse alcohol for most of their adult lives. We will study the human brain s capacity to use and respond to glutamate, its major natural excitant, in the regions that are selectively damaged by alcoholism. How these capacities are affected by heredity, and by diseases commonly associated with alcoholism such as cirrhosis of the liver, will also be explored.

This can occur in the eye disease, glaucoma, in which the pressure inside the eye is elevated. This serious condition often results in blindness. Much of the neuronal damage is thought to be due to the release of an excess of glutamate. Glutamate is a chemical (neurotransmitter) that nerves use to communicate with each other, but it is toxic to nerves when present at high concentrations. This project will utilise a new model of glaucoma to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the concentration of glutamate in the retina. If these mechanisms could be made to work more efficiently, they may prevent the build-up of the glutamate and therefore prevent damage to the nerve cells.

Current weight loss strategies using either lifestyle modification (diet and exercise) or drugs are relatively ineffective in the majority of obese individuals. This is partly due to the fact that we have an incomplete knowledge of the factors that regulate weight in humans. In laboratory studies we have shown that human fat cell development can be dramatically accelerated by fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1). This growth factor is produced by human endothelial cells, which are cells that line the blood vessels in fat tissue. When human fat cell precursors (preadipocytes) are cultured in the presence of FGF-1 the preadipocytes divide much more rapidly than normal and, additionally, then develop into mature fat cells much more rapidly than normal. These processes involved in development of new fat cells form the basis of fat tissue expansion in the body. The effect of FGF-1 on human fat cell development is far greater in magnitude than that of other known factors that promote fat cell growth. The aim of this project is to determine the actual biochemical pathways that mediate the effect of FGF-1 in promoting fat cell growth and development. Results obtained will provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating expansion of fat tissue mass in humans. Research aimed at identifying these underlying mechanisms, or at potentially contributing or exacerbating factors, is critically important in development of novel and more effective approaches to prevention and treatment of obesity."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Louise Hutley","data":{"first_name":"Louise","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037436","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hutley","source_individual_id":"RMIS2594062","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Louise Hutley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86697","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/60552","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of Hepatitis B surface antigen as a generic vector for the delivery of foreign CTL epitopes.","data":{"media_summary":"vaccine vectors","end_year":2008,"keywords":["hepatitis B","immunotherapy","vaccine development","virology","virus-like particle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":401526,"application_year":2005,"health_keywords":["DNA and VLP Vaccine","hepatitis B surface antigen","immunity-cellular","immunotherapy","vaccine vectors"],"scientific_title":"Development of Hepatitis B surface antigen as a generic vector for the delivery of foreign CTL epitopes.","start_year":2006,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof ROBERT TINDLE","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/401526","simplified_title":"HBsAg as a generic vaccine vector","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"439642.61","source_system":"Many kinds of cancer and infections display unique proteins which the body's immune system can recognise as ' foreign', and mount an immune response which, if correctly harnessed, will kill the cancer or infected cells .

predisposition and neuronal degeneration. The gene defective in this disorder, ATM, plays a central role in recognising damage to the genetic material and activates a number of different cellular pathways designed to maintain stability of genome and minimise the risk of cancer and other pathologies. In this project we are investigating how the protein is activated from a dormant state to phosphorylate a series of substrates involved in cellular signaling. Information in this process is very significant since the genetic lesion that activates ATM is a double strand break in DNA which not only is a potentially lethal lesion to the cell but has also the capacity to destabilize the genetic material. Information on this mechanism will also be useful for the design of small molecules that might interfere with ATM activation and in this way make tumour cells more susceptible to radiotherapy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Martin

Since their discovery antibiotics have had a profound effect on the health and well being of mankind, providing ready effective treatment for otherwise intractable infections. Although pencillin was initially effective against a large range of infections by the 1950s it was apparent that some bacterial strains had become resistant to this antibiotic. Partially in response to this resistance new antibiotics such as streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline were developed. These new drugs were potent against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, there were early signs that resistance to these drugs was also emerging. For example, in 1953, during a Shigella outbreak in Japan, a strain of the dysentery bacillus was isolated which was multi-drug resistant, exhibiting resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin and the sulfanilamides. Multidrug-resistance in pathogenic strains of bacteria has in the last decade presented an increasing problem in treatment of bacterial infections and diseases. In 1994 a Melbourne public hospital reported a new antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria. This bacterium was resistant to vancomycin (the antibiotic used when all others have failed) and is known as VRE or vancomycin resistant enterococcus. Now strains of golden staph resistant to all antibiotics have appeared. The re-emergence of tuberculosis (TB), which kills more than 3 million people annually and which is spreading rapidly throughout the world, is also a serious threat, particularly as many strains are now multi-drug resistant. New antibiotics are needed that overcome bacterial drug resistance. It is anticipated that this research will lead to new antibiotics by exploiting molecular components of bacteria that have only recently been identified."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Riley","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045089","middle_name":"Victor","last_name":"Riley","source_individual_id":"RMIS6184054","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Riley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88676","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Matthew Wilce","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034708","middle_name":"Charles James","last_name":"Wilce","source_individual_id":"RMIS182462","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Matthew Wilce"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85991","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Allan Mckinley","data":{"first_name":"Allan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032509","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Mckinley","source_individual_id":"RMIS1647700","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Allan Mckinley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85417","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Boris Martinac","data":{"first_name":"Boris","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020659","middle_name":"","last_name":"Martinac","source_individual_id":"5012362","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Boris Martinac"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82276","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6495","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Bacterial Pathogenesis: a genomic approach","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["evolution","genomics","mutation","pseudomonas"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351697,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Bacterial Pathogenesis: a genomic approach","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetics not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Dr Scott Beatson","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351697","simplified_title":"Bacterial Pathogenesis: a genomic approach","sub_type":"Howard Florey Centenary ECF","total_budget":"175686.94","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Scott Beatson","data":{"first_name":"Scott","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035306","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Beatson","source_individual_id":"5013405","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Scott Beatson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86151","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6426","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification of secreted that maintain metanephric mesenchyme using kidney explant cultures and transplantation assays.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Kidney disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351696,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Identification of secreted that maintain metanephric mesenchyme using kidney explant cultures and transplantation assays.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

However, very little progress has been made to minimize hearing damage in this special population. Early detection of hearing damage is not possible using traditional assessment tools. The present research seeks to investigate the use of innovative testing techniques to identify hearing damage in the early stages of the disease with high accuracy. If successful, the research will alter standard audiometric practice in hospital clinics around Australia, hence improving the standard of hearing health care for this group. The early diagnosis of hearing impairment will not only provide a chance for doctors to balance the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs against the danger of a permanent hearing loss, but also enable allied health professionals and educational specialist to provide timely management strategies. The determination of the rate and extent of hearing dysfunction progression in children receiving chemotherapy, as proposed in this research, enables the ototoxic effects of existing drugs to be compared. With this approach, the ototoxic side effects of new drugs can also be evaluated. In summary, the proposed study will improve the quality and efficiency of audiological service delivery to young children undergoing chemotherapy in Australia and overseas."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joseph Kei","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002584","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kei","source_individual_id":"5015638","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joseph Kei"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77375","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Bruce Charles","data":{"first_name":"Bruce","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000818","middle_name":"","last_name":"Charles","source_individual_id":"RMIS24960","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Bruce Charles"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76890","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6403","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The West Nile viral protease, NS3: a target for antiviral drug and vaccine design","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Drug Design","Enzyme","Inhibitor","Protease","West Nile Virus"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351594,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["infectious disease","vaccine strategy","viral inhibitor"],"scientific_title":"The West Nile viral protease, NS3: a target for antiviral drug and vaccine design","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Fairlie","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351594","simplified_title":"West Nile virus drug and vaccine development","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"230500","source_system":"The West Nile Virus (WNV) was first isolated from a woman in the West Nile region of Uganda in 1937. It is one of ~70 known flaviviruses (e.g. Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile, Kunjun, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, Australian encephalitis and the related hepatitis C virus) which annually infect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas, and cause major public health problems. WNV is endemic in the Middle East, parts of Africa and Europe, but recent epidemics in Israel (1998), Romania (1996), United States (1999), and UK (2003) have been characterized by severe symptoms , severe neurological pathology, and fatalities. In the USA alone there were 4,156 infections and 284 deaths in 2002, 9122 infections and 223 deaths in 2003, and this mosquito borne virus has quickly spread since 1999 through all USA states and into Canada and Mexico (http:--www.cdc.gov-ncidod-dvbid-westnile-index.htm). No treatments or vaccines are available. This project focuses on an enzyme, known as the West Nile Virus NS3 protease, that is essential for replication of the virus. By studying the enzyme in the laboratory we can design small molecules that can block its function and these have real potential as leads for development of drug treatments for people infected by this virus. A precedent is the success of inhibitors of HIV-1 protease that are the most effective treatment for humans with HIV-infections. Our studies will also be used to develop potential vaccines. The science involves experts on protease enzymes, drug design and development, virology including West Nile virology, and vaccine development. We expect to generate drug and vaccine candidates and new information for their development that is at the cutting edge of West Nile Virus research."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alexander Khromykh","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043491","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Khromykh","source_individual_id":"RMIS12877","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alexander Khromykh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88276","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Fairlie","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030610","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Fairlie","source_individual_id":"RMIS20617","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Fairlie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84952","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Roy Hall","data":{"first_name":"Roy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025278","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Hall","source_individual_id":"RMIS16831","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Roy Hall"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83509","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Young","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005625","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Young","source_individual_id":"RMIS20614","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Young"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78234","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6402","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"New leads for Anti-Cancer Drug Development","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Anti-cancer drugs","Drug Design","Protein Chemistry"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351590,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Anti cancer Development","Anti-tumor drugs","Novel therapeutics"],"scientific_title":"New leads for Anti-Cancer Drug Development","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof David Craik","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351590","simplified_title":"Novel Anti-cancer agents","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"326250","source_system":"There is an ongoing need for the development of new anticancer drugs, particularly those directed against solid tumours. In the past plants have been an extremely valuable source of anticancer agents, including the world s best selling anticancer drug, Taxol, isolated from the Pacific Yew tree. However, such molecules are typically complex and often very expensive to manufacture or extract from natural sources. So far very little attention has been paid to protein-based molecules from plants as potential anticancer agents because pharmaceutical companies have focused on organic molecules. In principle protein-based molecules could be produced much more cheaply and thus made available more widely to patients than existing drugs. All that is required are the lead molecules, or proteins that display sufficient anticancer activity to be used as the basis for further optimization. We have discovered a family of plant proteins called the cyclotides that have recently been shown to have considerable promise as anticancer agents. In the current project we will use synthetic chemistry to modify selected amino acids on the surface of this new family of proteins to determine which parts of the molecules are responsible for their activity. We will use this information to design improved analogues. The project is a collaboration between researchers at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, who have expertise in the required peptide chemistry and researchers and clinicians at Uppsala University, Sweden who have a range of assays and clinical expertise to test the new molecules. Both groups have been centrally involved in the discovery of the cyclotide family of plant proteins and are committed to developing them as exciting new anticancer agents."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Craik","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041813","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Craik","source_individual_id":"5011504","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Craik"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87851","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6401","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Validating a new model for growth hormone receptor activation","data":{"media_summary":"obesity prevention","end_year":2007,"keywords":["endocrine therapy","growth hormone","hormone signalling","tyrosine kinase receptor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351584,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cancer therapy","cardiovascular disease","diabetic retinopathy","growth hormone deficiency","obesity prevention"],"scientific_title":"Validating a new model for growth hormone receptor activation","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael WATERS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351584","simplified_title":"A new paradigm for activation of the body growth receptor","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"472500","source_system":"Growth hormone is an important hormone therapeutic for treating dwarfism. Recently, many new therapeutic applications for growth hormone have been discovered, particularly in relation to its anabolic actions. These include post surgery recovery, enhanced bone fracture healing, Crohns disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, infertility and ageing. The hormone exerts these actions through its receptor, which is a class1 cytokine receptor, similar to many receptors important in regulating immunity, inflammation, metabolism and cancers. In principle, if we can find out how the GH receptor works, this information would help in designing drugs to treat many immune and inflammatory disorders. With current NHMRC support we have developed a model which describes how GH activates the receptor at a molecular level. The model involves two pre-associated receptors at the cell surface binding to the hormone, with the result that the receptors are rotated relative to each other, and this brings the two JAK2 signalling units attached tothe receptor inside the cell into alignment, so they can activate each other. We can activate the receptor without hormone by artificially rotating it. This model is a prediction based on several techniques, but lacks proof of rotation. There are also a number of issues relating to the need for rigidity in the receptors, so the torque can be transmitted into the cell, since many believe there is no rigidity just above the membrane. We predict there is , but need to prove this. This information is vital for designing small orally active mimics of growth hormone, and for developing GH antagonists, likely to be useful for breast and colon cancer. Finally, we have evidence that the specificity of receptor signalling can be changed by mutating the outer part of the receptor (novel). We believe this can be used to change the activity spectrum of GH, hence decrease side effects, by developing analogs which activate one pathway or the other."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Waters","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022867","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Waters","source_individual_id":"RMIS47580","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Waters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82896","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6400","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Empowerment as a strategy for wellbeing in Indigenous settings: developing tools to systematically evaluate outcomes","data":{"media_summary":"healthier environments","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Empowerment research","Health Outcomes research","Indigenous health","Individual, group and community capacity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351582,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Improved self worth","Mastery and control","Social and emotional health","Stronger social networks","healthier environments"],"scientific_title":"Empowerment as a strategy for wellbeing in Indigenous settings: developing tools to systematically evaluate outcomes","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Social and Community Psychology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Melissa Haswell-Elkins","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351582","simplified_title":"Empowerment as a strategy for wellbeing in Indigenous settings: developing tools to systematically evaluate outcomes","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"403100","source_system":"This project will add significant strength to one of Australia's key initiatives in the promotion of health and well-being, namely the Family Well Being Program . This program was developed by a group of Aboriginal people based in Adelaide in order to specifically address the effects of colonisation on the emotional health and wellbeing of Indigenous Australians. It is a nationally accredited course and has been delivered in a wide variety of settings and participating groups. Previous evaluation using in-depth interviews, focus groups and course evaluation forms have revealed long lasting increases in participants' life skills and problem-solving capacity, thereby making them better able to help themselves and the young people around them to deal with emotions and life's challenges. Changes are particularly profound among individuals who have completed the full Four Stage Program (40 week course) and their families and communities. Up to now, the impact and outcome of the Family Well Being Program has not had a way of being objectively measured in the way that other health promotion programs have. This is partly due to the complexity of its aims; empowering people to take control of their lives, as opposed to trying to directly change behaviours that place them at risk of illness. It is also because the definition, pathway and results of becoming an empowered person, group and community are not completely understood and are likely to be expressed differently from one social and cultural group to another. This current project aims to gain a clearer understanding of the meaning, experience, outcomes and values people attach to empowerment; then use this information to design tools to help assess the effectiveness of programs that seek to stimulate empowerment. Activities will include further analysis of existing qualitative data, workshop discussions, piloting tools and implementing them within communities with ongoing Family Well Being programs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Komla Tsey","data":{"first_name":"Komla","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045925","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tsey","source_individual_id":"RMIS1122536","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Komla Tsey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88886","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christopher Doran","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042089","middle_name":"Mark","last_name":"Doran","source_individual_id":"5014376","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christopher Doran"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87913","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ernest Hunter","data":{"first_name":"Ernest","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025657","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hunter","source_individual_id":"RMIS226584","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ernest Hunter"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83608","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Melissa Haswell-Elkins","data":{"first_name":"Melissa","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019509","middle_name":"Ruth","last_name":"Haswell-Elkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS1289414","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Melissa Haswell-Elkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81966","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Yvonne Cadet-James","data":{"first_name":"Yvonne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018055","middle_name":"Lorraine","last_name":"Cadet-James","source_individual_id":"RMIS682305","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Yvonne Cadet-James"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81616","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Wilson","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011115","middle_name":"Andrew","last_name":"Wilson","source_individual_id":"5018407","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Wilson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79722","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6399","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of steatosis in promoting cellular injury and fibrogenesis in human liver disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["apoptosis","hepatic fibrosis","hepatic steatosis","hepatocyte proliferation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351579,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["NAFLD","hepatitis C","nonalcoholic steatohepatitis","obesity"],"scientific_title":"The role of steatosis in promoting cellular injury and fibrogenesis in human liver disease","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology and Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Elizabeth Powell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351579","simplified_title":"How fatty liver causes fibrosis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"414375","source_system":"Lay Description Fatty liver (steatosis) is important because it increases the vulnerability of the liver to factors that trigger inflammation and fibrosis. Patients with steatosis may develop steatohepatitis spontaneously and this increases the risk and rate of progression to cirrhosis, with consequent liver-related morbidity and mortality. In addition, steatosis significantly potentiates the severity of liver damage that is caused by other agents such as drugs or infections. To improve the prognosis of patients with fatty livers, it is important to understand why hepatic steatosis increases the risk for more serious liver disease. To date, much of our understanding of mechanisms of liver injury in fatty liver disease comes from animal models, and these findings have not been systematically evaluated in the human disease. Apart from optimizing body weight, there is no established treatment of fatty liver disease. Delineation of the mechanisms involved in liver injury will allow the development of specific protective strategies for steatotic livers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Powell","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044903","middle_name":"Ellen","last_name":"Powell","source_individual_id":"RMIS13575","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Powell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88622","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Clouston","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030002","middle_name":"Donald","last_name":"Clouston","source_individual_id":"RMIS228640","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Clouston"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84776","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Julie Jonsson","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002506","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Jonsson","source_individual_id":"5015557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Julie Jonsson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77348","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6398","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Exposure and risks from persistent organic pollutants through consumption of traditional seafood","data":{"media_summary":"Risk assessment","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Bioaccumulation","Dietary intake","Dioxin-like compounds","Environmental Health","Persistent organic pollutants"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351572,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Chronic disease","Dietary lifestyle","Environmental pollutants","Indigenous health","Risk assessment"],"scientific_title":"Exposure and risks from persistent organic pollutants through consumption of traditional seafood","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Indigenous Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Dr Caroline Gaus","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351572","simplified_title":"Contaminants in traditional seafood","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"322042.5","source_system":"For many coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, local marine resources provide an important and integral aspect of the communities' diet, culture and traditions. The health benefits associated with seafood consumption have been well documented. On the other hand, many environmental contaminants accumulate in the marine environment. In particular persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have the potential to accumulate to elevated levels in the marine food chain, including humans. Consumption of food contaminated with POPs can pose a risk of causing adverse health effects, including cancer, endocrine disruption, developmental and immunotoxic responses. Recent studies in Queensland have shown elevated concentrations of POPs, specifically dioxins, in the near shore marine environment. Concentrations present in dugong and turtle tissues were found to be among the highest reported compared to other marine biota worldwide. These species represent an integral part of the traditions and diet for many coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. However, to date no information on exposure to these compounds from locally sourced seafood exists in Australia. The proposed study will redress this lack of information and provide an understanding of the risks associated with the consumption of traditional seafood from local contaminated areas. In collaboration with the Quandamooka community, Moreton Bay in South East Queensland this will provide a case study with the objectives of: 1. Assessing the qualitative and quantitative risks associated with consumption of traditional and contemporary seafood sourced from local contaminated areas. 2. Providing communities with a thorough understanding of food contamination and building internationally competitive capacity in Australian Indigenous researchers. 3. Develop risk management options that allow informed decisions making on POP exposure and are acceptable to the community."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Caroline Gaus","data":{"first_name":"Caroline","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030847","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gaus","source_individual_id":"RMIS3205782","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Caroline Gaus"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84999","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6397","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Elucidation of the molecular requirements of the low affinity 'state' of the beta1-adrenoceptor","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["beta-adrenoceptor subtypes","membrane signaling","molecular pharmacology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351569,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","cardiovascular disease prevention","pharmacology"],"scientific_title":"Elucidation of the molecular requirements of the low affinity 'state' of the beta1-adrenoceptor","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Peter Molenaar","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351569","simplified_title":"Investigation of different beta1-adrenoceptor 'states'","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"535500","source_system":"Beta-blockers are used for the management of cardiovascular diseases including heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and high blood pressure. Beta-blockers mostly work by blocking the effects of a naturally occuring chemical called noradrenaline. Beta-blockers can be used to prevent noradrenaline induced increases in the rate and force of human heart contraction. We have discovered that one group of beta-blockers exemplified by CGP 12177 has the remarkable property of not only being able to block beta-receptors but they can also stimulate them at higher concentrations. Thus low concentrations block the effects of noradrenaline, but higher concentrations stimulate the receptor. More puzzling is that the stimulant effects of this group of beta-blockers cannot be easily blocked. To explain this we hypothesize that human beta-receptors can exist in two different 'states'. One 'state' can be stimulated by noradrenaline and blocked by low concentrations of beta-blockers such as propranolol and CGP 12177. Another 'state' of the same receptor is resistant to blockade by beta-blockers such as propranolol but can be stimulated by beta-blockers such as CGP 12177. This project seeks to investigate the molecular basis of the beta-adrenoceptor that is responsible for stimulant effects of beta-blockers. Specifically it explores the components of the beta-adrenoceptor that are critically and uniquely important for interacting with the stimulant beta-blockers. This project is an important increment in our laboratories research program to increase our understanding of the effects of beta-blockers. Our long term goal is to be able to develop beta-blockers that can block both states of the beta-adrenoceptor to provide a more effective block of the receptor and in particular for the improved management of heart failure."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Molenaar","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020938","middle_name":"","last_name":"Molenaar","source_individual_id":"RMIS221171","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Molenaar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ming Wei","data":{"first_name":"Ming","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019989","middle_name":"Q","last_name":"Wei","source_individual_id":"RMIS6079851","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ming Wei"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82090","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6396","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Transcription control of the c-fms gene","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["epigenetics","macrophage","transcription","transgenics","tumour progression"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351559,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Infectious Disease","Inflammation"],"scientific_title":"Transcription control of the c-fms gene","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof David Hume","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351559","simplified_title":"Relationships between production of white blood cells and cancer progression","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"666000","source_system":"This project concerns the basic biology of large white blood cells called macrophages.

Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are increasingly used as research and clinical tools in the management of LRTI in CF infants and are integral to the monitoring of future drug trials and gene therapy. Early LRTI particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) in CF is associated with a decline in pulmonary function and an increase in morbidity and mortality. Many CF centres internationally now treat young children with CF using aggressive antibiotic protocols in an attempt to eradicate infection. Most centres use oropharyngeal specimens to diagnose LRTI with a sensitivity of around 45% and specificity of around 90%. Thus many children miss out on treatment or are exposed unnecessarily to antibiotics. The use of antibiotics themselves may increase the risk of infection with resistant organisms thus complicating the design of drug trials in young children as monitoring for the emergence of resistant new organisms requires BAL. It is thus of key importance that the safety and value of FB and BAL is examined and long term outcomes are obtained. The financial costs of managing patients with CF in Australia may be estimated at more than $85 million-annum. Early intervention strategies may reduce health costs because of improved morbidity or may increase costs due to the intervention. This will be the first time an economic evaluation of early management and the cost effectiveness of an intervention in children with CF has been undertaken which will enable responsible health care planning for this important group of patients.

Patients exhibit significant variability due to a combination of anatomic, physiologic, hormonal and immunologic alterations occurring both at the wound site and, more importantly, in other body compartments and vital organ systems. Skin burn injury results in the release of multiple inflammatory mediators in addition to significant fluid loss. The distribution of inflammatory mediators and wound bacteria to central organs can cause complex physiological changes that may lead to multiple organ failure, with serious infections occurring in around 50% of patients with serious burns. Antibiotic distribution kinetics, such as bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, elimination half-life and unbound fraction in plasma can be significantly altered in burn patients. Without detailed knowledge of changes and relationships between factors such as wound pH, tissue oxygenation, protein concentrations of fluid leaked from the local wound microvasculature, tissue binding, oedema and changes in burned and non-burned tissue induced by resuscitation therapies, the optimisation of both local and systemic infection contriol therapies can hardly be expected to advance. This project aims to determine how changes the physiology of burn patients, in particular in the burn wound environment, affect antibiotic penetration and distribution into tissues.

Such cell-to-cell adhesion is mediated by the cadherin family of molecules, which reside at the surfaces of cells. Cadherins allow cells to recognize one another and, upon recognition, adhere to one another. By this means populations of individual cells can be linked together into cohesive populations (i.e. the tissues or organs of the body). The importance of cadherin adhesion is exemplified by the well-documented observation that disruption of cadherin adhesion contributes to many important diseases, including inflammation of epithelia and cancers. Thus understanding the mechanisms by which cadherins hold cells together is necessary for us to understand the molecular basis of commondisease. It has long been known that cadherins work in cooperation with elements within the cell, called the cytoskeleton. My lab has recently made the novel discovery that microtubules, specific components of the cytoskeleton, can regulate the functionof cadherin adhesion molecules. Inparticular, microtubules appear to affect how cadherins can participate in dynamic cell processes necessary for cells to be properly organized in tissues. In this project we will probe the molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect of microtubules. The information obtained will provide important new insights into how dynamic cadherin adhesion is controlled, to help our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that couple cells into tissues, and how they may be disrupted in diesase."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alpha Yap","data":{"first_name":"Alpha","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034891","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yap","source_individual_id":"5018525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alpha Yap"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86044","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6387","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms of death receptor-mediated apoptosis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["NMR spectroscopy","biochemistry","protein structure","protein-protein interaction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351503,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["autoimmune disease","biological sciences","cell death"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms of death receptor-mediated apoptosis","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Justine Hill","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351503","simplified_title":"Death receptors and apoptosis","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"472500","source_system":"The balance between cell division and programmed cell death is crucial for normal development, maintenance of homeostasis, and immune system function.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the mechanisms of signal transduction through Fas and TNFR1 differ significantly, however, they both require the adaptor protein FADD to induce apoptosis. In this study we will elucidate the molecular basis of the interactions between FADD and its binding partners using biochemical and biophysical studies.

Death or brain damage may result. In the days after birth, when the brain is attempting to recover from the lack of oxygen, seizures (also called fits) are common. Seizures may cause further damage to the brain because they release damaging chemicals such as glutamate or because they make extra energy demands on the brain that cannot be met. It is difficult to be certain whether unusual movements or twitches are seizures or not. To detect seizures, it is necessary to measure the EEG, the tiny electrical signals from the brain that can be measured from the scalp using small stick on electrodes. It is difficult to measure EEG, particularly for longer periods, because the electrodes may fall off, the baby may move excessively or electrical interference may ruin the recording. We are proposing to measure EEG for 48 hours in babies who have suffered a lack of oxygen during delivery. We will develop, optimise and implement a new method of automatically detecting seizures, building upon 6 years of fundamental signal processing research work that we have done in the newborn. We will test this system against the 'gold standard' to determine how accurate it will be in detecting seizures. We will also try to find out whether damage in particular areas of the brain or in particular cell types within the brain is most likely to be associated with seizures. The anticipated outcome is that we will be able to accurately identify seizures. This is a major step on the path to being able to prevent injury to the brain and to monitor the effectiveness of new experimental treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Barbara Lingwood","data":{"first_name":"Barbara","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0043819","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Lingwood","source_individual_id":"5016005","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Barbara Lingwood"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88355","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Christopher Burke","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018010","middle_name":"","last_name":"Burke","source_individual_id":"RMIS67619","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Christopher Burke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81604","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephen Rose","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009965","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Rose","source_individual_id":"5017273","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephen Rose"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79404","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Colditz","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006654","middle_name":"Bernard","last_name":"Colditz","source_individual_id":"RMIS23314","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Colditz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78507","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Boualem Boashash","data":{"first_name":"Boualem","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000451","middle_name":"","last_name":"Boashash","source_individual_id":"RMIS477867","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Boualem Boashash"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76779","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6385","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Physiological and neurophysiological assessment of lip and tongue function for speech in multiple sclerosis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["dysarthria","motor control","multiple sclerosis","neurophysiology","pathophysiology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351490,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["improving the quality of life of those with a disability","motor speech disorders","multiple sclerosis","neuropathology"],"scientific_title":"Physiological and neurophysiological assessment of lip and tongue function for speech in multiple sclerosis","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rehabilitation and Therapy: Hearing and Speech","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Bruce Murdoch","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351490","simplified_title":"Assessment of lip and tongue movements and neural control for speech in multiple sclerosis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"356250","source_system":"Speech difficulties are commonly experienced by people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and can have a devastating, restrictive effect on social interactions, work and education opportunities, ultimately reducing quality of life.

In a disease known as primary aldosteronism (PAL), hypertension results from the excessive production of the salt-retaining hormone, aldosterone, by the the body's adrenal glands. In some patients, this is due to the growth of an aldosterone-producing adrenal tumour. Recent work performed within the Hypertension Unit at Greenslopes Hospital and continued by these investigators within the Hypertension Unit at Princess Alexandra Hospital has shown that PAL is the commonest potentially curable form of hypertension, accounting for at least 5% and possibly 10% of patients. Several lines of evidence accumulated by these investigators, including the detection of a new familial variety of PAL (Familial Hyperaldosteronism Type II or FH-II), suggest that PAL is a genetic disorder. The study sets out to locate the genetic defect causing PAL by comparing genetic material collected from affected members of these families with that from non-affected members, and by comparing genes from patients with PAL with those of unrelated, unaffected individuals. Once the genetics of this condition is understood, affected persons can be detected early in life, and even at birth, and the ill-effects of their developing conditions prevented."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Richard Gordon","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025132","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Gordon","source_individual_id":"RMIS41928","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Richard Gordon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83460","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Stowasser","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022365","middle_name":"","last_name":"Stowasser","source_individual_id":"5017746","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Stowasser"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82770","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr David Duffy","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012817","middle_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"Duffy","source_individual_id":"5014423","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr David Duffy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80170","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6381","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Is EphA4 the major molecular regulator of axonal regeneration?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["EphA4","Motor function","Neural regeneration","Neurite outgrowth","Spinal cord injury"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351479,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Astrocyte gliosis","Movement dysfunction","Neural regeneration","Spinal cord injury"],"scientific_title":"Is EphA4 the major molecular regulator of axonal regeneration?","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew Boyd","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351479","simplified_title":"Is EphA4 the major molecular regulator of spinal cord repair?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"491000","source_system":"Spinal cord injury affects a substantial number of Australians each year. Around half the number of spinal cord injury cases result in quadriplegia, with loss of function to a varying degree in the upper as well as the lower limbs. The limited degree of repair of spinal axons following injury means that such paralysis is usually permanent. Although the inability to walk is a serious issue, the limited function of the arms and hands results in a loss of independence which is a major factor contribuing to the enormous personal, financial, and community costs of this problem, estimated to cost the Australian community $200 million a year. In recent years advanced anatomical and molecular approaches to the problem of repair of the central nervous system have provided great insights into the neuronal and glial reactions to neural damage that appear to govern the success or failure of neural regeneration. Our preliminary data indicate that a receptor tyrosine kinase, EphA4, which is important for axonal pathfinding in the developing nervous system, is a potent inhibitor of neural regeneration following spinal cord injury. In this project we will determine the mechanisms by which EphA4 exerts its inhibitory effects, and examine the effect of neutralizing EphA4 signalling on neural regeneration. Success in achieving this result will lead to the development of a therapeutic intervention that we will test in mouse models."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Andrew Boyd","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023731","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Boyd","source_individual_id":"RMIS3609","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Andrew Boyd"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83095","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mary Galea","data":{"first_name":"Mary","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0019118","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Galea","source_individual_id":"5014751","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Mary Galea"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81880","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Ann Turnley","data":{"first_name":"Ann","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016752","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Turnley","source_individual_id":"5019345","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Ann Turnley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81253","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Perry Bartlett","data":{"first_name":"Perry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011651","middle_name":"Francis","last_name":"Bartlett","source_individual_id":"5013357","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Perry Bartlett"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79864","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6380","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Origin of cells in the 'artificial' artery grown in the peritoneal cavity","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Cell Biology","Monocyte/macrophage differentiation","Myofibroblast","Plasticity","Smooth Muscle"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351476,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Artery bypass graft","Cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease","Cell growth/differentiation","Urogenital disorders"],"scientific_title":"Origin of cells in the 'artificial' artery grown in the peritoneal cavity","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Julie Campbell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351476","simplified_title":"Can macrophages trans-differentiate into smooth muscle?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"489000","source_system":"Implantation of a foreign object (such as a sterile, flexible plastic tube) into the abdominal cavity of animals induces cells floating in the peritoneal fluid to form a capsule around the object. Over the next 2-3 weeks, the cells differentiate into fibroblasts then myofibroblasts. When this capsule of living tissue (in the appropriate moulded shape) is subsequently grafted into smooth muscle-rich organs such as artery, bladder, uterus or vas deferens to replace excised segments, it gains the structure of the surrounding tissue and the myofibroblasts differentiate further into functional smooth muscle. This raises the question: what is the origin of the cells of the capsule? Our previous studies suggested that monocyte-macrophages stimulated to enter the abdominal cavity in response to the sterile foreign body might be the source of the cells. In the current study we will use transgenic (c-fms EGFP and c-fms Cre Z-AP) mice in which cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage are genetically labelled. These cells can be clearly distinguished from all other cells of the body, and analysis of capsules formed around foreign bodies will give us a definitive answer. We will using micro-array analysis, determine which growth factors-cytokines are important in regulating differentiation of the cells, and the role of physical factors (eg pulsatile stretching). Finally, we will determine whether these cells stimulated to enter the abdominal cavity are capable of differentiating along alternative pathways, such as cardiac muscle or liver cells. Knowledge gained will further the use of the abdominal cavity as a bioreactor in which to engineer tissues for organ replacement therapies. Identification of the mechanisms regulating the (trans)differentiation and biology of the cells may also assist in wound repair strategies to prevent pathologies caused by excessive myofibroblast accumulation and fibrosis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Barbara Rolfe","data":{"first_name":"Barbara","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004314","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Rolfe","source_individual_id":"RMIS19792","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Barbara Rolfe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77870","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Julie Campbell","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000708","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Campbell","source_individual_id":"RMIS330901","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Julie Campbell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76860","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Gordon Campbell","data":{"first_name":"Gordon","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0000705","middle_name":"","last_name":"Campbell","source_individual_id":"RMIS14178","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Gordon Campbell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76859","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6379","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"STudy of Risk Assessment To reduce complications In patients Following noncardiac surgerY (STRATIFY)","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Anesthesia","Cardiac complications","Dobutamine echocardiography","Prognosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351475,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Coronary artery disease","Echocardography","Major noncardiac surgery","Myocardial ischemia"],"scientific_title":"STudy of Risk Assessment To reduce complications In patients Following noncardiac surgerY (STRATIFY)","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Unfortunately, while money and effort is expended on identifying patients at risk, the appropriate response to this risk is quite unclear. The performance of bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty in order to treat the underlying coronary disease of at-risk patients is used in other situations, and reduces longterm risk. However, in many patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery, this approach may be inappropriately aggressive, as these patients are often elderly, have other diseases that make heart operations more difficult and risky than usual, and in any case may have a reduced life expectancy from the disease necessitating the operation. As the most critical issue is to ensure that patients undergo their surgery uneventfully, an alternative is the use of intensive medical therapy to protect the heart. This multicentre study, based at Brisbane hospitals that perform large numbers of major operations, will follow up patients for complications, and outcome (including quality of life) will be assessed six months after the operation. We will address two important questions about the efficacy and cost of risk reduction strategies. First, in patients at higher levels of risk and with a positive stress test, could a combination of medical therapy designed to protect the heart be as effective as current approaches, which include the performance of bypass surgery or coronary balloon angioplasty? Second, in patients identified as being at some risk - but low risk - are drugs sufficiently effective to avoid the need for further testing to quantify risk? As the population continues to age, the numbers of at risk patients undergoing major surgery will increase, and answers to these questions will provide important information to guide their management."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Marwick","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032377","middle_name":"Hugh","last_name":"Marwick","source_individual_id":"RMIS108223","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Marwick"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85383","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeffrey Lipman","data":{"first_name":"Jeffrey","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032130","middle_name":"","last_name":"Lipman","source_individual_id":"5012259","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jeffrey Lipman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85314","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr John Atherton","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029226","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Atherton","source_individual_id":"RMIS2362369","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr John Atherton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84578","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Walker","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022791","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS1116934","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Philip Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82875","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bala Venkatesh","data":{"first_name":"Bala","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016832","middle_name":"","last_name":"Venkatesh","source_individual_id":"RMIS5223868","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bala Venkatesh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81276","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6378","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Does immunosuppression affect the post-transplantation hepatic fibrogenic response?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Cirrhosis","Hepatic stellate cell","Immunosuppression","Liver"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351466,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Immunosuppression","Liver cirrhosis","Liver transplantation"],"scientific_title":"Does immunosuppression affect the post-transplantation hepatic fibrogenic response?","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gastroenterology and Hepatology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Darrell Crawford","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351466","simplified_title":"The role of immunosuppression in scar formation following liver transplantation.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"360000","source_system":"Liver transplantation is often the only treatment option for patients who progress to end-stage liver disease after initial treatment has failed. Unfortunately, re-emergence of disease is common and patients often develop fibrosis and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) in the donor organ. In some cases it has been observed that this scarring often develops rapidly, sometimes in a year or less following transplantation. Re-transplantation is often required. This differs from the usual progression of cirrhosis pre-transplant which often takes years or decades to develop. While essential to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ, immunosuppression is not without side effects. To date, few studies have examined the effect of immunosuppressive agents on the development of hepatic fibrosis and the key fibrosis effector cell type, the hepatic stellate cell. These reports have shown that one of the most commonly used immunosuppressant agents (FK-506) may adversely influence fibrosis progression while rapamycin may prevent fibrosis progression. However little is known regarding the mechanisms through which this occurs. We propose to examine the effect of four different immunosuppressants on fibrosis development both in vitro and in vivo to determine whether scar development or scar breakdown pathways are altered post-immunosuppression. If the factors driving the fibrogenesis in the transplanted organ can be elucidated it may then be possible to develop therapeutic strategies to tackle the problem. This may result in a reduced need for re-transplantation which has obvious benefits to the transplant patient but would also reduce the numbers of donor organs required."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kim Bridle","data":{"first_name":"Kim","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017903","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Bridle","source_individual_id":"RMIS2353158","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Kim Bridle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81571","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Linda Fletcher","data":{"first_name":"Linda","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013042","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Fletcher","source_individual_id":"5014660","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Linda Fletcher"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80225","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Darrell Crawford","data":{"first_name":"Darrell","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006770","middle_name":"Henry Gordon","last_name":"Crawford","source_individual_id":"5012156","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Darrell Crawford"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78535","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6377","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification of oncogenes from myeloid leukaemias by retroviral expression cloning","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["growth factor","leukaemia","monocyte/macrophage differentiation","oncogene","retroviral gene transfer"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351463,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["drug target","myeloid leukaemia","myeloproliferative disorders of the haemopoietic system"],"scientific_title":"Identification of oncogenes from myeloid leukaemias by retroviral expression cloning","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Thomas Gonda","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351463","simplified_title":"A new approach for identifying cancer-causing genes involved in leukaemia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"552000","source_system":"The success rates for treatment of most myeloid leukaemias remain relatively poor, with 5-year survival rates of 40-50% overall.

An important and relatively new approach for doing this is to target the specific molecular and genetic alterations that lead to these diseases. This requires the identification of these alterations, particularly the oncogenes ('cancer genes') that cause or contribute to the various forms of myeloid leukaemia. However in many cases (up to 50%), the key oncogenes involved in have not and-or cannot be identified using current methods. This project aims to develop and apply a powerful technique called 'retroviral expression cloning' for the identification of oncogenes involved in myeloid leukaemia.

Such cell-to-cell adhesion is mediated by the cadherin family of molecules, which reside at the surfaces of cells. Cadherins allow cells to recognize one another and, upon recognition, adhere to one another. By this means populations of individual cells can be linked together into cohesive populations (i.e. the tissues or organs of the body). The importance of cadherin adhesion is exemplified by the well-documented observation that disruption of cadherin adhesion contributes to many important diseases, including inflammation of epithelia and cancers. Thus understanding the mechanisms by which cadherins hold cells together is necessary for us to understand the molecular basis of commondisease. Characteristically, cadherins accumulate in structures called adherens junctions, and preserving those junctions is important both for tissues to organize and also to prevent tumor progression. Despite this, we know very little about how junctions are preserved in epithelia. The research to be conducted in this grant will examine exactly this problem. It builds upon recent findings from my lab which indicate that the motor molecule, myosin 2 plays an essential role in preserving junctions. Furthermore, we will test the role for signaling pathways within cells to control the activity of myosin 2 at junctions. This research will provide important novel insights into the cellular mechanisms that couple cells into tissues, and how they may be disrupted in diesase."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alpha Yap","data":{"first_name":"Alpha","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034891","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yap","source_individual_id":"5018525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alpha Yap"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86044","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6372","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Dissecting pain pathways with conopeptides","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Chronic and neuropathic pain","Conotoxins and toxinology","Ligand-gated ion channels, adrenergic receptors an","NMR and structure-activity relationships","Neuropharmacology, neurophysiology and molecular n"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351446,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Dissecting pain pathways with conopeptides","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Richard Lewis","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351446","simplified_title":"Improving our understanding of chronic pain using conopeptides","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"7614296.06","source_system":"A major obstacle to the development of safer and more effective pain treatments is the poorly defined nature of the different pathways involved in chronic pain.

This Program will discover and use highly selective conopeptides such as these to dissect the pharmacology of peripheral pain pathways and their projections into the central nervous system, and to identify and characterise new targets amenable to drug intervention. The long-term goal of the Program is to discover new targets in pain pathways and develop conopeptides that act on these targets in animal models of chronic pain.

It therefore provides an excellent model for examining the growth, development and maintenance of nerve cells. This project will examine how one specialized type of cell, the olfactory ensheathing cell, helps the nerve cells to grow and regenerate. Information we obtain about how this system develops and regenerates may be useful in treating brain disorders and spinal injuries In the current project we will examine how olfactory nerve cells interact with the ensheathing cells. We will use transgenic mice in which the different cells are marked by separate colours which will allow us to easily identify the cells and see where they grow. In addition, we will also examine the behaviour of live cells as they are growing. In the past all attempts to understand how nerve cell connections are formed in the olfactory system have used dead tissue that has been permanently preserved. In this project we have the unique opportunity to visualise living nerve cells to enable us to determine how the cells interact with the ensheathing cells. The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to identify important interactions as they occur, rather than attempting to decipher them after they have occurred. An analogy would be watching a football game live and observing how goals were scored and appreciating the performance of individual players versus trying to guess from the final score how the game was played and who the key performers were. These experiments will provide important information about how the olfactory ensheathing and nerve cells grow and regenerate."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Mombaerts","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032651","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mombaerts","source_individual_id":"RMIS3124863","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Peter Mombaerts"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85453","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brian Key","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020093","middle_name":"","last_name":"Key","source_individual_id":"RMIS68076","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Brian Key"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82124","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr James St John","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004781","middle_name":"A","last_name":"St John","source_individual_id":"RMIS5210245","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr James St John"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77995","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6368","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Deciphering the molecular steps leading to the potentiation of neuronal exocytosis by arachidonic acid","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Arachidonic acid","Cell biology","Exocytosis","Hormone and peptide secretion","SNARE"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351434,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Adrenaline and noradenaline secretion","Hormone secretion","Neurodegenerative diseases"],"scientific_title":"Deciphering the molecular steps leading to the potentiation of neuronal exocytosis by arachidonic acid","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Membrane Biology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Frederic Meunier","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351434","simplified_title":"Unraveled role of arachidonic acid during exocytosis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"273000","source_system":"Release of hormones and neurotransmitters relies on a process called exocytosis which involves SNARE proteins: syntaxin1A and SNAP-25 on the target plasma membrane and VAMP on the vesicular membrane. Availability of the t-SNARE on the plasma membrane is believed to play a major role in controlling the amount of exocytosis. Syntaxin1A bound to Munc18 constitute an 'unproductive-reserve' pool of closed Syntaxin that cannot interact with SNAP-25. Intracellular messengers capable of releasing Syntaxin1A from Munc18 thereby making it available to interact with SNAP-25, are foreseen to play a major role in potentiating exocytosis - a process with ramification for memory and learning. We have identified arachidonic acid, a lipidic messenger which fullfil this role. For the first time we are in a position to manipulate at the molecular level different pools of SNARE proteins with direct implications for our understanding of the mechanism of secretion. Very few models are currently available to understand how learning and memory occur in the brain. Our research points to a new direction: the amount of 'active' and 'unproductive-reserve' pools of SNARE proteins present on the plasma membrane of neurosecretory cells are in dynamic equilibrium and arachidonic acid, a second messenger capable of trans-synaptic action, can modify this equilibrium resulting in an increase of the amount of 'active' SNARE thereby potentiating the amount of transmitter-hormone released by exocytosis. Importantly, this research lays the basis for a dynamic view of the secretory mechanism with important implications for treatment of diseases such as diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Our hope is that by understanding at the molecular level how secretory cells regulate the amount of their secretion, we will be in a position to modify these parameters in order to counteract illnesses of the nervous system."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Frederic Meunier","data":{"first_name":"Frederic","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020864","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Meunier","source_individual_id":"5016455","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Frederic Meunier"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82341","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Martin","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008922","middle_name":"Louise","last_name":"Martin","source_individual_id":"5022915","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Martin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79117","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Poronnik","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004031","middle_name":"","last_name":"Poronnik","source_individual_id":"RMIS7101816","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Philip Poronnik"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77792","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6367","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The PDZ scaffold NHERF-1; a novel regulator of astrocyte function?","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["amino acid trasport","astrocytes","glutamate","neurological disease","scaffold protein"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351412,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["epilepsy","hydrocephaly","hypoxia","ischaemia"],"scientific_title":"The PDZ scaffold NHERF-1; a novel regulator of astrocyte function?","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Philip Poronnik","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351412","simplified_title":"NHERF in astrocytes","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"444500","source_system":"Astrocytes are a vital cell type in the human brain. They provide nutrients to neurons, remove toxic chemicals such as glutamate (a neurotransmitter), as well as stabilising the levels of molecules such as water and ions such as sodium, bicarbonate and potassium. Astrocytes perform all these tasks by means of specialised protein molecules called transporters that are embedded in their cell membranes. These transporters are not uniformly distributed; they are positioned in those parts of the astrocyte membranes where the particular biological job has to be performed. How are they targeted to, and retained in these places? We have preliminary data suggesting that a specialised protein called NHERF-1, can bind a group of these proteins, called glutamate transporters, thereby anchoring them to the skeleton of the cell. If we are correct then we should be able to manipulate this interaction, both in live brain tissues, and in simple cell culture systems, using a variety of physiological and molecular biology techniques. If we are correct in our hypothesis, then our findings will have immense value in trying to reduce damage that occurs in human brains in conditions such as strokes, where a breakdown in the control of glutamate around neurons causes extensive and irreversible brain damage."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Pow","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021533","middle_name":"Vaughan","last_name":"Pow","source_individual_id":"RMIS4392155","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Pow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82534","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Chris Yun","data":{"first_name":"Chris","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017300","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Yun","source_individual_id":"RMIS3118999","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Chris Yun"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81405","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Poronnik","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004031","middle_name":"","last_name":"Poronnik","source_individual_id":"RMIS7101816","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Philip Poronnik"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77792","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stefan Broer","data":{"first_name":"Stefan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0000554","middle_name":"","last_name":"Broer","source_individual_id":"5018671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stefan Broer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76808","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6366","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The ClC-5 Cl- channel, a key regulatory role in albumin uptake by the proximal tubule","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["albumin uptake","chloride channel","proteinuria","proximal tubule","ubiquitination"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351411,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["hypertension","progressive renal disease","proteinuria"],"scientific_title":"The ClC-5 Cl- channel, a key regulatory role in albumin uptake by the proximal tubule","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nephrology and Urology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Philip Poronnik","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351411","simplified_title":"ClC-5 and albumin uptake","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"510500","source_system":"The clinical association between protein loss in the urine and retention of salt, resulting in high blood pressure and progressive decline in kidney function, is well known. Under normal conditions, the kidneys filter 180 litres of water and reabsorb 1.7 kg of salt per day, a function which is principally performed by the kidney tubules in the kidney. Similarly the kidney tubule cells reabsorb and break down up to 3 grams of albumin per day. In the past, it has been considered that excessive protein loss in the urine is primarily due to problems in the filtering units of the kidneys, rather than due to abnormalities in the reabsorption of protein in the kidney tubules. However, we consider that common abnormalities in the processes within the kidney tubules that regulate both the reabsorption of salt and the excretion of acid may result in concomitant high blood pressure and increased protein loss in the kidney. Thus the overall aim of the project is to investigate the mechanisms by which the complex responsible for protein uptake determines the interrelationship between protein reabsorption and catabolism and the ion transporting proteins in the membrane of the proximal tubule. This project will comprehensively characterise the mechanisms of protein uptake in kidney tubule cells. The exact nature of the interaction of the proteins involved in performing the salt reabsorption and ensuring correct catabolism of protein uptake with the actual protein uptake mechanism will be determined. As persistent proteinuria is the most important predictor of tubulointerstitial pathology and progressive decline in renal function in almost all renal disease, the understanding of the precise mechanism by which this occurs is essential in the design of renoprotective therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Carol Pollock","data":{"first_name":"Carol","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039130","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Pollock","source_individual_id":"5017027","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Carol Pollock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87145","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof William Guggino","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007639","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Guggino","source_individual_id":"RMIS3111046","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof William Guggino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78768","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Poronnik","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004031","middle_name":"","last_name":"Poronnik","source_individual_id":"RMIS7101816","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Philip Poronnik"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77792","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6365","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Targeted drug delivery by topical application","data":{"media_summary":"Transdermal kinetics","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Drug targeting","Formulation design","Skin permeability","Skin risk assessment","Transdermal delivery"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351410,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Drug binding and distribution","Skin delivery system design","Structure-activity relationships","Topical exposure risk assessment","Transdermal kinetics"],"scientific_title":"Targeted drug delivery by topical application","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael Roberts","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351410","simplified_title":"Topical Drug Delivery","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"537000","source_system":"Drugs are applied to the skin for the treatment of a wide range of conditions, including both local (eg. inflammation, muscle pain, eczema, psoriasis and other dermatological conditions) and systemic (eg. angina, hormone replacement, nicotine withdrawal) therapies.

In addition, unwanted skin absorption also occurs following exposure to environmental occupational chemicals, and those applied deliberately to the skin such as insecticides, sunscreens and cosmetics. This study continues our work in seeking to define the relationship between the chemical structure of agents, the types of formulations and solvents in which they are applied or come into contact with the skin and their penetration, distribution and retention in the various layers of the skin and underlying tissues. Of great significance to both the pharmaceutical industry and risk assessment regulatory bodies will be the further development of our work into important areas relating to the ability to predict the likely behaviour of a solute following contact with the skin from the aspect of both optimising drug delivery systems and the accuracy of risk assessment procedures. We will also be continuing our work examining techniques to facilitate drug transport through the skin using physical techniques such as iontophoresis and the design of formulations to specifically target larger pores in the skin such as hair follicles as a means of improving delivery rates and increasing the range of solutes, particularly those of large molecular weight, likely to be considered as potential drug candidates."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Roberts","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039362","middle_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Roberts","source_individual_id":"RMIS41002","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Roberts"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87206","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Yuri Anissimov","data":{"first_name":"Yuri","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0011472","middle_name":"","last_name":"Anissimov","source_individual_id":"RMIS3110670","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Yuri Anissimov"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79814","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Sheree Cross","data":{"first_name":"Sheree","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0001098","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cross","source_individual_id":"RMIS40999","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Sheree Cross"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76971","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6364","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"RNA trafficking in oligodendrocytes and neurons","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["RNA trafficking","heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins","long-term potentiation","memory","myelin basic protein mRNA"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351409,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["demyelination","memory loss","nervous system development"],"scientific_title":"RNA trafficking in oligodendrocytes and neurons","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ross Smith","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351409","simplified_title":"Transport of RNA in cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"439500","source_system":"Control of the use of DNA, gene expression, is vital to all living organisms, especially in development and disease. The information in the genes is transferred to an intermediate molecule, mRNA, in a process called transcription. The genetic information in the mRNA is subsequently used, in the process called translation, to make the protein encoded by the original gene. The switching on and off of DNA appears to be most frequently controlled at the transcription step but recently it has become apparent that there are many post-transcriptional events that govern how efficiently the genetic information is ultimately converted to protein molecules. In this project we will investigate the molecular mechanisms of several proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), that appear to play regulatory roles in many of these steps. These proteins appear to affect the longevity and replication of cells, the important chemical changes that take place in RNA after it is transcribed and before it is translated, the movement of the modifed RNAs through the cell and the efficiency of translation. Because of these central functions they are involved in development of tissues such as the brain, and in diseases including lung, skin and brain cancers, and rheumatoid arthritis. In this project we will focus on two RNA molecules, one vital for myelination in the central nervous system and the other for memory."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Smith","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045515","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"RMIS6441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88776","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joseph Rothnagel","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009982","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Rothnagel","source_individual_id":"5017267","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joseph Rothnagel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79410","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6363","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effective management of acute whiplash injuries requires a pragmatic approach: An RCT with stratified treatments","data":{"media_summary":"whiplash related disorders","end_year":2007,"keywords":["clincial trial","multidisciplinary","physiotherapy","psychology","whiplash injuries"],"nhmrc_grant_id":351408,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["early intervention","health economics","injury rehabilitation and management","post-traumatic stress","whiplash related disorders"],"scientific_title":"Effective management of acute whiplash injuries requires a pragmatic approach: An RCT with stratified treatments","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rehabilitation and Therapy: Occupational and Physical","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Gwendolen Jull","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/351408","simplified_title":"A clinical trial investigating individualised treatments for persons with an acute whiplash injury","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"382550","source_system":"Whiplash injuries from a motor vehicle crash continue to incur substantial personal and financial costs to the community and the insurance industry. The current approaches to an acute whiplash injury in Australia and internationally have failed to lessen the rate of how many people develop chronic neck pain. Between 40 and 60% still have pain 6 months after injury. Motor Accident Insurance Commission (Qld) figures indicate that 20% of patients with chronic whiplash account for 60% of the costs. Transition from an acute to a chronic condition must be prevented. A new direction in management in the acute stage is urgently required as once the pain has become chronic, it is difficult to help. This research will conduct a novel randomised controlled trial for acute whiplash. It will test individually prescribed multi-professional management against usual care with the aim to lessen the numbers who go on to develop chronic pain. It will be the first clinical trial that acknowledges from the outset that the whiplash injuries and affects people in different ways. Our previous research with acute whiplash patients has documented the variations in presentation from physical, physiological and psychological perspectives. In this trial, management will be prescribed as directed by measurable pain, muscle and psychological impairments in the individual, rather than regard all patients as the same as in other trials. This trial will offer individualised treatments; medical, physiotherapy and-or psychological using an empirically derived treatment algorithm. Cost-effectiveness of the program will be evaluated against that incurred during usual care. It is predicted that early multi-professional management will be less expensive in the long term than existing approaches.

MS is generally thought to be an autoimmune disease, in which a person's own immune cells start to attack components of the brain and spinal cord. However, it is thought that the same components are not attacked in all patients, and that the pathway that leads to MS varies from one person to another. Therefore, in order to develop successful treatment strategies for MS, it will be necessary to look for patterns in the clinical symptoms and signs and other features of a person's MS that may give clues as to which particular pathway is leading to disease in that person. Some people who develop MS also develop other autoimmune diseases, or have these other diseases before they develop MS, or have other family members who have other autoimmune diseases. We have recently found that people who have the same combination of coexistent MS and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) show similar clinical signs of MS, and tend to have damage (lesions) to the same areas of their nervous system. This suggests that these people may have the same underlying pathways leading to the development of MS, and that they may be a very informative group in which to look for immune or genetic abnormalities that might explain why they develop MS. This project will investigate people who have both MS and AITD and other members of their families to see if we can work out what the links are between having the same combination of autoimmune diseases and developing lesions in particular parts of the nervous system. It will provide information on the pathways that lead to the development of MS, and information obtained from this study may eventually be of use in developing more specific therapeutic agents, by tailoring therapies to specific people with MS, depending on the clinical and immunological profile of that person."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Judith Greer","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0036976","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Greer","source_individual_id":"RMIS24768","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Judith Greer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86571","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Pender","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009604","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Pender","source_individual_id":"RMIS18293","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Pender"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79308","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6361","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"New statistical approaches to the identification of genes contributing to complex traits.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Disease gene mapping","Genetic association","Genetic linkage","epigenetics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":339477,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"New statistical approaches to the identification of genes contributing to complex traits.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Quantitative Genetics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Dr Jackie Wicks","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/339477","simplified_title":"New statistical approaches to the identification of genes contributing to complex traits.","sub_type":"Australian Research Training ECF (Part-time)","total_budget":"76917.5","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jackie Wicks","data":{"first_name":"Jackie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0017087","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wicks","source_individual_id":"RMIS2356996","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Jackie Wicks"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81337","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6114","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional Significance of ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Mre11","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Gene Expression","Genetic Disease","Phosphorylation","Radiation Biology","Signal Transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":339444,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["Biochemistry and molecular biology","Chromosomal Disorders","Gene expression","Genetic Disease"],"scientific_title":"Functional Significance of ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Mre11","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Martin Lavin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/339444","simplified_title":"Role of ATM in radiation response","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"211500","source_system":"The aim of the project is to investigate the response of human cells to radiation damage to DNA.

The intention here is to investigate some of the normal mechanisms of cellular response to radiation and determine why they are deficient in cells from individuals with these rare syndromes. We will focus on a protein, ATM, which is activated by radiation and on one of its substrates Mre11. Both molecules are involved in sensing and transmitting signals from DNA to cell cycle checkpoints. The expected outcome of this study is a greater understanding of the intricate set of signaling pathways that are activated in response to radiation damage. In addition it is expected that a detailed knowledge of these pathways and what goes wrong in specific disease states will be of assistance in understanding risk of developing cancer.

However, the evidence for multiple processing streams is fragmentary, and not entirely consistent. The proposed experiments will combine anatomical and physiological approaches to evaluate the functional organization of auditory cortex in the primate brain. We will map the electrical responses of single brain cells to various complex sounds across the brain surface, and inject dyes to label pathways linking brain areas to one another. The data will allow us to determine whether specific subdivisions of the auditory cortex are specialized for processing different types of infomation, and whether specific subdivisions are linked together to form processing streams specialized for sound recognition and space perception. The results will advance our understanding of the neuronal processing involved in the perception of sound, with possible implications for speech perception.

The information in the genes of DNA is transferred to an intermediate molecule, mRNA, in a process called transcription. The genetic information in the mRNA is subsequently used, in the process called translation, to make the protein encoded by the original gene. The switching on and off of DNA appears to be most frequently controlled at the transcription step but recently it has become apparent that there are many post-transcriptional events that govern how efficiently the genetic information is ultimately converted to protein molecules. An important step is the cutting out of parts (introns) of the RNA molecule that is copied from DNA, and splicing of the retained sections (exons). During this process the RNA may also lose one or more of its exons. As a result of this variable retention of exons a single gene may produce many isoforms of the protein it encodes. By this mechanism the roughly 30,000 genes in the human genome can give rise to potentially hundreds of thousands of proteins. RNA splicing connects to cancer in two ways. First, changes in the concentrations of the proteins that control splicing may change the isoforms, resulting in changes that lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Secondly, DNA mutations that affect the splicing process can also vary the ratios of the isoforms produced from a gene: if this occurs in a protein that is involved in the growth of cells this too may lead to cancer. In this project we will study the molecular mechanism of this alternative splicing, and particularly a group of proteins that generally favour the excision of some exons, with a focus on cancer cells. Recent publications have highlighted the potential for the therapeutic use of drugs that target the splicing apparatus: it is anticipated that studies of alternative splicing will underpin development of new therapeutic agents."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Smith","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045515","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"RMIS6441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88776","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joseph Rothnagel","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009982","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Rothnagel","source_individual_id":"5017267","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joseph Rothnagel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79410","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5501","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"TLR9 And The Response To Foreign DNA","data":{"media_summary":"vaccination","end_year":2006,"keywords":["immune regulation","innate immunity","macrophage","macrophage activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301211,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["allergy","autoimmunity","cancer therapy","infectious disease","vaccination"],"scientific_title":"TLR9 And The Response To Foreign DNA","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Katryn Stacey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301211","simplified_title":"How immune cells detect foreign DNA","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"465750","source_system":"This project is based upon the observation that the mammalian immune system can distinguish between its own genetic material (DNA) and the DNA of infectious agents such as bacteria.

The team members have the complementary skills to assess all aspects of the problem, including crucial functional and clinical expertise. By combining resources we will position ourselves at the very forefront of the international competition to discover and to evaluate clinically the molecular mechanisms underlying neural repair and regeneration. This is of enormous significance in determining how we best treat stroke, injury and other neurodegenerative diseases in the next 10 years, and will lead to the development of new therapeutics of immense value. The team will use innovative approaches such as cell-sorting to obtain pure populations of stem cells and their progeny in order to identify new therapeutic targets; these will then be validated in animal models of neurological disease.

Doing regular physical activity is very important for maintaining good health. It helps to prevent weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and breast and colon cancer. Unfortunately, most Australian adults are not active enough for health benefits. Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing rapidly; more than 50% of Australian adults are above the healthy weight range. Rates of type 2 diabetes have doubled in the past 20 years. New ideas and practical tools are therefore needed to tackle these serious �diseases of inactivity�. To this end, Professors Neville Owen, Adrian Bauman and Wendy Brown will bring together innovative and practically useful scientific approaches drawn from psychology, epidemiology and exercise physiology. The approach is interdisciplinary _ it combines theories and methods from their individual disciplines in an innovative manner, within a public health framework. Their research to date has developed better methods for measuring people�s exercise habits and has provided new insights into how personal, social and environmental circumstances can make people less active. They have also shown how to design and deliver wide-reaching programs for different social groups and evaluated their effectiveness. Their new research program will build on and significantly extend these ideas and approaches into new areas.For example, they will develop new measures of incidental physical activity and sedentary behaviour and will develop and test new, complex community interventions.Their new program will involve in-depth study of some of the most challenging researchproblems in an important and under-researched area of public health. They will further combine their disciplines and the skills of their research team in new, creative and practical ways, to answer important research questions about physical activity and population health. These ideas and approaches will be used to identify practical ways to help more people to be more physically active."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Adrian Bauman","data":{"first_name":"Adrian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035294","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Bauman","source_individual_id":"5012367","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Adrian Bauman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86147","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wendy Brown","data":{"first_name":"Wendy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023824","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS1714084","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wendy Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83116","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Neville Owen","data":{"first_name":"Neville","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003812","middle_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Owen","source_individual_id":"5016815","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Neville Owen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77725","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5497","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of Patched/Hedgehog signalling in common human cancer.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["conditional gene targeting","medulloblastoma","mutation analysis","skin cancer","transgenic animals"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301198,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["basal cell carcinoma","cancer genetics","genetic disorders","medulloblastoma"],"scientific_title":"The role of Patched/Hedgehog signalling in common human cancer.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

There is a great deal of evidence that naturally occuring Complement proteins in human blood are involved in exacerbating these and many other human diseases, yet there are no good drugs available to counteract their effects. Three complement proteins known as C3a, C5a and MAC (membrane attack complex) are thought to be particularly pivotal components of the complement system synthesized by the human body early in the development of inflammatory and immune diseases. New compounds that could block the formation of human C3a, C5a and MAC are expected : (a) To lead us to a better understanding of how these proteins act on immune cells and of their respective roles in the immune response to infection and injury, and (b) To enable the rapid development of an entirely new class of drugs for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. No Complement-based drugs are yet available in man. In other NHMRC funded work we have developed compounds (antagonists) that selectively block the actions of human C3a or C5a, and shown that they are effective antiinflammatory agents in rat models of a number of inflammatory diseases. In this project we will design and develop small molecules that block the enzymes (C3-C5 convertases) that make C3a, C5a and other complement proteins including MAC. We expect that such inhibitors will be even more effective antinflammatory drugs because they will block formation of multiple complement proteins that each have proinflammatory activity. We will demonstrate selective effects of the new compounds on components of complement, and test them in rat models of inflammatory diseases. We expect C3-C5 convertase inhibitors to be a completely new type of anti-inflammatory drug, treating disease processes rather than symptoms like current drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Fairlie","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030610","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Fairlie","source_individual_id":"RMIS20617","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Fairlie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84952","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010587","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS41211","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79577","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"John Abbenante","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0005696","middle_name":"","last_name":"Abbenante","source_individual_id":"RMIS34220","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"John Abbenante"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78255","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5495","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of MC1R polymorphism in skin cancer risk phenotypes","data":{"media_summary":"Skin colour","end_year":2006,"keywords":["G-protein coupled receptors","Melanocortin-1","Melanocyte","Pigmentation","Signalling pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301173,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Freckle","Melanoma","Moles","Skin Cancer","Skin colour"],"scientific_title":"The role of MC1R polymorphism in skin cancer risk phenotypes","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Richard Sturm","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301173","simplified_title":"Regulation of human pigmentation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"480750","source_system":"Sunsmart campaigns are a unifying element in the lives of many Australians who wish to ensure protection against the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays in sunlight.

An essential first step in understanding the complex interactions that give rise to melanoma, and in identifying individuals that have a high susceptibility, is to reduce phenotypic analyses to genotypic classifications. As pigmentation phenotype is a factor of central importance in determining an individuals risk for melanoma, characterisation of the genes underlying the physical qualities of human eye, hair and skin colour will give a more direct and accurate genotypic assessment of risk. Results from an epidemiology study of melanoma patients in Queensland have identified a number of genetic changes within the melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor (MC1R) gene that associate with skin, hair and eye colour as well as with incidence of melanoma. Further investigation of MC1R gene alleles which segregate with skin and hair colours will provide the beginning for a whole new genotype-based classification of skin colour and melanoma risk, and will significantly contribute to our understanding of what makes some individuals highly susceptible to melanoma while others are not. Indeed, MC1R polymorphisms may numerically be the most important melanoma predisposition gene yet identified, exerting its effects as one of those common genes of small effect which may account for much more of the case load in melanoma than rarer genes of large effect. Studies such as this will enable powerful genotyping methods to be employed in identification of those individuals at highest risk for melanoma and other skin cancers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Richard Sturm","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045672","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Sturm","source_individual_id":"5017777","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Richard Sturm"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88811","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Richard Newton","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021126","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Newton","source_individual_id":"RMIS2383493","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Richard Newton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82414","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5494","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structure, function and cellular trafficking of the flavivirus NS1 protein","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["flavivirus","molecular biology","mutagenesis","protein trafficking","virus replication"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301165,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["arbovirus diseases","vaccines","virus replication"],"scientific_title":"Structure, function and cellular trafficking of the flavivirus NS1 protein","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Roy Hall","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301165","simplified_title":"Studies on the structure, function and cellular distribution of a protein that is required for flavivirus replication","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"496500","source_system":"Flaviviruses are spread mainly by mosquitoes or ticks and include globally important pathogens such as yellow fever, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile.

Infections due to pathogenic E. coli may be limited to mucosal surfaces or can disseminate throughout the body. Amongst the different classes of pathogenic E. coli, diarrheagenic strains (namely enterotoxigenic and enteroinvasive E. coli) are responsible for the death of an estimated one million humans per year, mainly in third world countries. The majority (80%) of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in humans are caused by E. coli and in Australia alone there are about 250,000 cases per year. It is estimated that one in four women and one in twenty men will develop a urinary tract infection in their lifetime. Pathogenic E. coli strains are normally equipped with multiple virulence factors and there is mounting evidence that the expression of such factors is finely orchestrated by mutual regulatory cross-talk. For example, expression of flagella (which provide motility) and adhesins (which provide attachment) are fundamentally counteracting phenotypes, yet the molecular and genetic mechanisms that coordinate their expression are unknown. I plan to examine inter-system cross-regulation of bacterial surface structures (namely adhesins, autoaggregaters, capsules and flagella). The aim is to understand on the molecular level how microorganisms orchestrate expression of virulence factors and will have consequences for our understanding of microbial pathogenicity. The strategy outlined may lead to new routes for strain attenuation and perhaps a method for vaccine strain construction.

We expect that a genetic modification in mice to increase the normal production of key prostaglandin enzymes, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), in bone cells will increase the number of cells that remove bone (osteoclasts), and increase bone loss and the rate of bone turnover when compared to normal mice. We believe this will occur via the effect of prostaglandins on expression of genes that control osteoclast formation. This will be tested by examining the structure of the skeleton, and the expression of certain genes, in transgenic mice at different ages from 2-8 months. These effects may be exacerbated in conditions of increased bone turnover, such as postmenopausal bone loss. This will be tested by examining the bone structure and gene expression in adult mice following removal of their ovaries. Due to the role of COX-2 in adaptation of bone to mechanical loading, we also expect the load-bearing skeleton to be more sensitive to increased weight-bearing activity. We will investigate this hypothesis by applying mechanical loads to the tibiae of mice in a controlled manner and then analysing the bone structure. Knowledge of specific pathways by which bone formation can be stimulated is important for developing novel approaches to induction and augmentation of osteogenesis in skeletal diseases associated with ageing or disability, or for maintenance of new bone around implants. The discovery that COX-2 is a key enzyme in mechanotransduction and osteoclastogenesis in bone, and a pharmacological target for modulating inflammation, has considerable clinical significance.

Improved anti-TNF therapeutics are needed for clinical management in all of these conditions. Our studies are focused on investigating how macrophages synthesize and secrete TNF, with the ultimate goal of characterizing the molecules and vesicles in the TNF secretory pathway. Our recent findings show the expression of SNARE proteins, part of the vesicle docking and fusion machinery, is regulated in concert with cytokine secretion and other trafficking changes in activated macrophages. We identified the proteins Syntaxin4, Munc-18c and SNAP-23 as the specific t-SNARE complex that regulates TNF delivery to the cell surface. In the proposed studies we will investigate how SNAREs are regulated during macrophage activation by studying their gene expression and protein modifications. We have developed a single-cell assay to measure TNF trafficking in macrophages; this allows the identification of molecules with roles in TNF secretion and it will be used in a series of experiments to identify the specific v-SNARE proteins that partner the t-SNARE for TNF delivery. Finally we will use live cell imaging to investigate how and where TNF is delivered to the macrophage cell surface and membrane fractionation to examine a role for membrane microdomains in organizing SNARE-mediated TNF secretion.

This syndrome is most frequently due to ischemic or hypertensive heart disease, and most commonly occurs in the elderly. The optimal management of DHF is not well defined, although some drug trials are currently in progress. A number of studies have shown exercise training to improve functional capacity by 15-20% in typical heart failure. However, training has not so far been trialled in DHF.

This work will teach us about the optimum exercise prescription, in terms of the duration and nature of training, as well as the safety and effectiveness of exercise training. By using a number of sensitive measurements of heart and vessel function (in which our group has special expertise), we will identify whether exercise training exerts its effect through improvement in vascular function and myocardial properties.

Recently, these results have been extended to show that various insults, such as stroke, can cause the proliferation of precursor cells in the adult brain, which ultimately results in the addition of new nerve cells that go on to repair the pathological damage. Although the production of new nerve cells under normal conditions and following damage is highly significant, we still know surprisingly little about the nature of the precursor population which produces these cells and even less about their regulation.

Each cancer has a unique set of gene changes thus making it difficult to treat. However, it has become clear that the normal control mechanisms of many cancers are still intact but are repressed by the over expression of these oncogenes (or cancer genes). By turning off these oncogenes we can restore normal control to the cell and the cancer will die normally. We will use a new method of gene targeting called RNA interference to turn off oncogenes. RNA interference involves treatment of cells with a small peice of genetic material that provides the cell with an identity pattern of the gene to be eliminated. The cell takes the pattern and turms off the genes expression. As long as the pattern only turns off the cancer gene all other genes will remain normal. We will test this using cervical cancer as a model as all these cancers are caused by infection with a virus that carries 2 oncogenes. It is these virus oncogenes that cause the cancer and therefore we know the exact target genes that need to be turned off. Most importantly these genes are not present in normal cells making it safe to target them by RNA interference.

If successful we will have proven this new technique can work against cervical cancer and this method could then be applied to any cancer. We would then be able to start human trials.

In particular, we will investigate the role that cleavage or controlled breakdown of the receptor plays in mediating its cell death activity. A fundamental aspect of this proposal is determining whether cleavage is due to presenilin-dependent activity, given that presenilin mutations have been demonstrated in most familial Alzheimer s disease cases. While this will increase our understanding of one of factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease, it also has much broader implications. A wide range of pharmaceuticals which regulate presenilin cleavage are already being developed and clinically tested for their efficacy in the treatment of Alzheimer s disease.

Many children who experience a brain injury go on to have long-term difficulties such as significant educational and social problems. Post-traumatic stress occurs in children following traumatic physical injury. However it is not clear to what extent this is so for children who have received a traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, when there is a traumatic brain injury and traumatic stress, it is not clear how these interact, how they influence long-term outcomes, and what factors such as pre-injury functioning and family support and distress mediate outcomes. These issues are very important since effective rehabilitation of children following traumatic brain injury is essential to maximise long-term functioning and minimise disability. To be effective, rehabilitation must be guided by the knowledge about key factors that determine the recovery process. This study aims to provide answers to these questions by following two cohorts of children (aged 6-14) over 18 months after receiving a traumatic brain injury. In total 240 children will be recruited from Brisbane and Melbourne hospitals. They will be assessed at three, six, twelve and eighteen months post-injury using measures of cognitive, psychological and social functioning. Information on parent distress and behaviours will also be obtained. The information obtained will provide the basis for the development of a specific rehabilitation strategy for children with traumatic brain injury, including information on strategies to help prevent any confounding impact of post-traumatic stress on recovery."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Justin Kenardy","data":{"first_name":"Justin","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037727","middle_name":"Alastair","last_name":"Kenardy","source_individual_id":"RMIS53308","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Justin Kenardy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86768","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nicholas Bellamy","data":{"first_name":"Nicholas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035335","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bellamy","source_individual_id":"RMIS3691361","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nicholas Bellamy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86158","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Vicki Anderson","data":{"first_name":"Vicki","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029167","middle_name":"Anne","last_name":"Anderson","source_individual_id":"RMIS168398","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Vicki Anderson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84564","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lynne Mckinlay","data":{"first_name":"Lynne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014881","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mckinlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS2406855","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lynne Mckinlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80725","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5482","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Dissecting the molecular mechanisms driving cell migration during neurulation triggered by the netrin receptor, neogenin","data":{"media_summary":"neural tube defects","end_year":2006,"keywords":["control of cell movement","developmental neurobiology","molecular mechanism","neural stem cell","neuronal migration"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301099,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["CNS repair after injury","cell signalling","migration","nervous system development","neural tube defects"],"scientific_title":"Dissecting the molecular mechanisms driving cell migration during neurulation triggered by the netrin receptor, neogenin","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Helen Cooper","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301099","simplified_title":"The molecular processes underlying the formation of the embryonic brain triggered by the receptor, neogenin","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"432750","source_system":"In humans, abnormalities in brain and spinal cord formation during early embryogenesis result in congenital syndromes such as spina bifida and anencephaly. These defects occur at a rate of 1-1000 pregnancies and are therefore a major contributor to pre- and perinatal deaths. In the early embryo, the brain and spinal cord begin as a hollow tube of cells (the neural tube) that subsequently expands into the complex structures seen at birth. It is known that the neural tube is formed by a complex process in which early neural cells migrate toward the midline of the embryo and subsequently coalesce. This project seeks to determine the function of one molecular signaling pathway (the neogenin pathway) that has been implicated in driving these cell migration events. We will initially use the frog, Xenopus laevis, as our embryonic model since the developmental processes that form the Xenopus neural tube closely parallel those ocurring in the human embryo. This model will allow us to identify the molecules in the neogenin signaling pathway. We will also create mice that carry a mutation in the neogenin gene so that we can study neogenin function in the mammal. We anticipate that these studies will provide important insights into the development of the central nervous system and also into the aberrant molecular processes underlying neural tube defects in man."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Helen Cooper","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018393","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Cooper","source_individual_id":"RMIS222363","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Helen Cooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81710","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5481","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["NEURAL CELL-DEATH","NEURAL STEM CELLS","NEURONAL REPAIR AND REGENERATION","NEUROTROPHOPHIC GROWTH FACTORS"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301097,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2008,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Perry Bartlett","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301097","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"54748.12","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Perry Bartlett","data":{"first_name":"Perry","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0011651","middle_name":"Francis","last_name":"Bartlett","source_individual_id":"5013357","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Perry Bartlett"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79864","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5480","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Design and Synthesis of peptide - based drugs for multiple sclerosis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["NMR spectroscopy","drug design","multiple sclerosis","myelin proteins","protein engineering"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301093,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["central nervous system demyelination and inflammation","multiple sclerosis","novel therapeutic agents for T-cell autoimmune diseases"],"scientific_title":"Design and Synthesis of peptide - based drugs for multiple sclerosis","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof David Craik","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301093","simplified_title":"New drugs for multiple sclerosis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"351000","source_system":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects ~1 million young adults worldwide. It is a debilitating disease for which there is currently no cure. The most effective treatment available, interferon-b (IFN-b) is useful for the treatment of some forms of the disease, reducing the relapse rate, that is the frequency of attacks or exacerbations of the disease, and delaying the time to onset of sustained progression of the disability. This treatment may, however, cause adverse side effects, result in the development of antibodies that neutralise its function and is prohibitively expensive. In addition it does not slow the sustained progression of the disease in 20-40% of patients with the two most common types of MS and does not appear to directly affect deterioration of the protective layer around neurons, myelin. There is clearly a need for the development of therapeutics that address these issues and the drug leads to be developed in this project may help to overcome some of these shortfalls. While the immune system of a healthy individual is able to distinguish between foreign molecules and its own molecules, in MS the immune system fails to do this. An immune response against important proteins that form part of the protective myelin layer around neurons occurs. This means that the integrity of the protective layer is compromised. The peptide-based drugs that we plan to develop in this project are designed to interfere with the interaction between these important myelin proteins and their immune system targets. This will leave the myelin proteins to carry out their normal physiological roles and should therefore significantly slow, if not halt, progression of the disease. Given the prevalence of MS such a development could have a profound impact on the health and quality of life of many individuals and their families, and has the potential to substantially reduce the economic burden of this disease on the community."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Craik","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041813","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Craik","source_individual_id":"5011504","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Craik"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87851","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Claude Bernard","data":{"first_name":"Claude","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029436","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Bernard","source_individual_id":"RMIS118720","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Claude Bernard"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84631","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5479","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Histone hyperacetylation affects G2/M cell cycle transition","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Mitosis","cell cycle checkpoint","centromere","histone acetylation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301086,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["ant-cancer therapy","cancer","drug targets"],"scientific_title":"Histone hyperacetylation affects G2/M cell cycle transition","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301086","simplified_title":"Disrupting chromosome structure affects mitosis.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"302250","source_system":"The mechanisms controlling cell growth are often disrupted in cancers.

The identification of how this growth control mechanism operates in normal cells, and defining the defect in tumour cells has the potential to identify new targets for more specific and potent anti-cancer drugs. The increased specificity, i.e. destruction of only the tumour cells while have little or no effect on the surround normal body tissue, would be extremely beneficial as one of the drawbacks to conventional anti-cancer treatments is their unwanted normal tissue toxicities.

SCCs commonly arise in areas of the body that have been exposed to excessive amounts of UV irradiation. The cells of the skin from which SCCs are derived are called keratinocytes. UV irradiation causes lesions within these cells such that their growth and maturation are disrupted leading to deregulated growth and maturation and hence tumour formation. We have previously identified a protein, E2F, that is central to this process and whose inhibition leads to decreased cancer cell growth. During the course of these studies we noted that the deregulation of E2F could also lead to the disruption of keratinocyte maturation. This led us to propose that the inhibition of E2F in SCCs may result in both decreased cancer cell growth as well as the reinstatement of a normal maturation process. this would make E2F inhibitors a very attractive therapeutic for treating SCC. In the present study we aim to explore the ability and the mechanism by which E2F modulates keratinocyte proliferation and maturation. This will be done in vitro as well as in animal models of SCC.

To achieve these goals we will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques based on manipulations with infectious complementary DNA copy of Kunjin virus RNA. The intimate understanding of these mechanisms in flavivirus replication should facilitate the design of efficient antiviral drugs by specifically targeting unique events in RNA replication and-or packaging. This may assist in the development of antiviral drugs for treatment of infections caused by other higly pathogenic flaviviruses in Australia, such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Murray Valley encephalitis, and in the rest of the wirld such as New York strain of West Nile virus as well as the related heptitis C virus. Understanding the mechanisms of Kunjin virus replication and assembly will also aid in the further development of this virus as a safe vaccine vector against other viruses, e.g. HIV, and diseases such as cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Wenjun Liu","data":{"first_name":"Wenjun","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0043838","middle_name":"","last_name":"Liu","source_individual_id":"RMIS2346721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Wenjun Liu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alexander Khromykh","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043491","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Khromykh","source_individual_id":"RMIS12877","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alexander Khromykh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88276","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5473","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of Crim1, a novel TGFb superfamily modulator, in early vertebrate patterning, vascular and renal development.","data":{"media_summary":"vascular disease","end_year":2006,"keywords":["embryonic development","kidney","knockout mice","vascular development","zebrafish"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301056,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["chronic renal failure","fetal development","kidney disease","renal disease","vascular disease"],"scientific_title":"The role of Crim1, a novel TGFb superfamily modulator, in early vertebrate patterning, vascular and renal development.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

One of the groups within the superfamily, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are being used in clinical trials to assist in regrowing bones after fracture. These molecules are also of interest for clinical reasons as growth factors within this family can also be deleterious, with their overexpression leading to conditions such as renal fibrosis and cataract. The activity of these growth factors is regulated by many other proteins, including protein antagonists which bind and inactivate them. It is therefore possible that by understanding these antagonists, we can find new ways of altering TGF beta superfamily activity. We have previously identified a novel protein, Crim1, which we have now shown can bind to TGF superfamily members and can reduce their secretion. We believe that Crim1 plays a role in the patterning of the central nervous system, the development of the blood vessels and the kidneys by regulating the TGFbeta superfamily. In this grant we will be investigating what the effect of disruption to Crim1 is on these organ systems and working out which members of the TGFbeta superfamily it is affecting to cause these effects. To do this, we will knock out the gene in zebrafish and characterise the defects found in a mouse line in which the gene has been disrupted. This may be important in developing new ways of activating or inactiviating these growth factors in a number of clinical conditions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Melissa Little","data":{"first_name":"Melissa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038091","middle_name":"Helen","last_name":"Little","source_individual_id":"5012687","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Melissa Little"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86868","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5472","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Tropisetron: molecular mechanisms of action at the 5-HT3 receptor and the glycine receptor","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["ion channels","molecular neuroscience","molecular pharmacology","patch-clamping","receptor structure and function"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301053,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["analgesia","anti-emetic","chemotherapy treatment effects"],"scientific_title":"Tropisetron: molecular mechanisms of action at the 5-HT3 receptor and the glycine receptor","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Peripheral Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Joseph Lynch","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301053","simplified_title":"Molecular mechanism of action of an anti-emetic drug","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"371800","source_system":"Tropisetron and related drugs are used clinically to combat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

Lipid disease is associated with hyperinsulinemia, and anomalous levels of the lipid triad, i.e. low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol and elevated triglycerides. Increased incidence of cardiovascular disease has been linked to dyslipidemias associated with diet and lifestyle. Diabetes, atherosclerosis, and obesity are comorbidities with these lipid disorders. HDLs have a defensive role in the prevention of dyslipidemia by mediating cholesterol efflux from tissues. In contrast, the LDLs accumulate in the arterial wall leading to atherosclerosis. Physiological maintenance of lipid homeostasis requires a dynamic balance between metabolic signalling cascades, diet, lifestyle etc. PPPARs are nuclear hormone receptors that function as fatty acid activated transcription factors that regulate lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. PPARs are bona fide targets for the development of therapeutic compounds useful in the treatment of lipid disorders. PPAR delta is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass peripheral tissue that accounts for ~40% of total body weight. Muscle is a major site of glucose metabolism and, fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, it is an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and HDL levels. Consequently, it has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, the blood lipid profile and lipid metabolism. Understanding the functional role of PPAR delta in skeletal muscle, a peripheral tissue that accounts for 40% of total body weight is of paramount importance in understanding whole body lipid homeostasis. Understsanding these receptors may provide a pharmaceutical solution for the prevention of hyper-lipidemia--cholesterolemia, and atherogenic disease.

Orphan NRs belong to the superfamily on the basis of their sequence identity, however, the endogenous signaling molecules which bind to these proteins are unknown. The orphan NRs Nur77, NURR1, and NOR1, functions as stress response genes which are induced by a wide range of physiological stimuli Furthermore, the NR4A subgroup of receptors has been implicated in carcinogenesis, neurological disorders; inflammation, diabetes and atherogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to examine the molecular mechanisms that control the regulation of gene expression by the orphan nuclear receptors, Nur77 and NOR-1. Furthermore, we will investigate the pathophysiological function of NOR-1 and Nur77 in muscle. Nur77 and NOR-1 are expressed in skeletal muscle. This major mass tissue accounts for ~40% of total body weight and, is a major site of glucose and fat metabolism. Consequently, this peripheral tissue plays a significant role in insulin sensitivity, and the blood lipid profile. Furthermore, a collaboration with industry has identified NOR-1 as an insulin responsive gene in muscle, which becomes hyper-sensitive to insulin induction in diabetic patients. Additionally, we have exciting evidence that the anti-neoplastic purine anti-metabolite, 6-mercaptopurine activates the NR4A subgroup.

Importantly it interferes with activities such as walking, jogging, gym classes and aerobics, which are often prescribed to prevent serious conditions of the heart, diabetes and obesity. Hence it negatively impacts on the health and well being of our nation. Two popular treatment options that are commonly prescribed for the management of patellofemoral pain syndrome are physiotherapy and foot orthotics.

There is a lack of evidence for the use of orthotics in treating patellofemoral pain syndrome. This project will conduct a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the relative benefits of orthotics as the sole treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome and also when combined with physiotherapy. Factors associated with predicting the results of orthotic therapy will be studied to see if there are any tests that a health care practitioner can perform to provide information early on in a consultation regarding possible treatment outcomes.

The first step for selection of risk-reduction therapy in an individual is to assess his-her risk status and the benefit of intervention. Several risk assessment tools, incorporating traditional risk factors, have been developed from Western populations. They would be most appropriately applied to individuals who resemble the study sample; their validity in Aboriginal Australians has not been evaluated and no risk prediction formulae have been developed specifically for Aboriginal people.

Given the disadvantaged circumstances of many Aboriginal people, it is likely that some of the factors are influencing their CVD risk. The applicants have collected baseline risk factor data on volunteers in one Aboriginal community and followed their course, including CVD deaths and CVD hospitalisations, for more than a decade. From this baseline information, which goes beyond traditional risk markers, and from additional measures like birthweight, and markers of inflammation and nutrition assayed in retrieved serum, we will develop a variety of models for predicting a CVD risk in this group. We will also lay plans to evaluate these tools in other Aboriginal groups. A better understanding of the causes of CVD in this population is important to influence public health policy for CVD prevention. The models will be helpful health education tools at the community level and will allow therapeutic or lifestyle intervention in individuals to be targeted at their individual risk profile."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Zhiqiang Wang","data":{"first_name":"Zhiqiang","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028670","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wang","source_individual_id":"5019801","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Zhiqiang Wang"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84425","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Wendy Hoy","data":{"first_name":"Wendy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013767","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Hoy","source_individual_id":"RMIS3725","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Wendy Hoy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80407","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5462","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Electrophysiology","Ion channel","Pain","Protein structure-function","Receptor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301023,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Joseph Lynch","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301023","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"583750","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Joseph Lynch","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032228","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Lynch","source_individual_id":"5016080","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Joseph Lynch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85342","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5461","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Control of blood vessel development by SOX transcription factors","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Developmental genes","Embryonic development","Knockout mice","Murine models","Transcription factors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301018,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Defects in embryonic development","Genetics","Peripheral vascular disease"],"scientific_title":"Control of blood vessel development by SOX transcription factors","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

Improper development of blood vessels in the embryo can compromise survival of the embryo, and predispose patients to vascular disease after birth. The growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is also an important factor in the ability of solid tumours to grow during the progression of cancer. It is therefore of fundamental importance in the health sciences to gain an understanding of how blood vessels form and regenerate. We discovered a gene, Sox18, that appears to regulate blood vessel development by controlling the formation and-or properties of endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels and make them impermeable. Our research so far indicates that MICE WITH DEFECTS IN SOX18 DIE FROM VASCULAR DEFECTS, underlining the importance of this gene. THIS PROJECT IS CONCERNED WITH FINDING OUT HOW SOX18 WORKS - exactly what goes wrong in mice lacking this gene, whether Sox18 can influence endothelial cell behaviour in cell culture, how Sox18 comes to be active in endothelial cells, what genes are switched on by Sox18, and what genes Sox18 co-operates with in its role in endothelial cells. The answers to these questions will not only provide fundamental basic information about how blood vessels development is controlled, but also sow the seeds for possible future therapies in which blood vessel development could be stimulated (eg in wound healing) or suppressed (eg in tumour progression) by drug treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Koopman","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043570","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Koopman","source_individual_id":"5015773","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Koopman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88298","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof George Muscat","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026936","middle_name":"E.O","last_name":"Muscat","source_individual_id":"RMIS5658","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof George Muscat"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83974","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5459","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mucosal bacterial pathogens in inflammatory bowel diseases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Bioinformatics","Enteric bacteria","Inflammatory bowel diseases","Molecular cloning"],"nhmrc_grant_id":301013,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Mucosal bacterial pathogens in inflammatory bowel diseases","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Microbiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Timothy Florin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/301013","simplified_title":"Mucosal bacterial pathogens in inflammatory bowel diseases","sub_type":"Practitioner Fellowship","total_budget":"226500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Timothy Florin","data":{"first_name":"Timothy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013048","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Florin","source_individual_id":"5014662","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Timothy Florin"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80228","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5458","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neuroanatomical dynamics of attention in stroke patients and healthy individuals: A magnetic stimulation investigation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Crossmodal Interactions","Parietal Lobe","Selective Attention","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Unilateral Neglect"],"nhmrc_grant_id":299958,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Extinction","Neurological Rehabilitation","Stroke"],"scientific_title":"Neuroanatomical dynamics of attention in stroke patients and healthy individuals: A magnetic stimulation investigation","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biological Psychology (Neuropsychology, Psychopharmacology, Physiological Psychology)","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Jason Mattingley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/299958","simplified_title":"Brain processes underlying attention in stroke patients and in healthy individuals: A magnetic stimulation study","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"360363","source_system":"Mechanisms of selective attention are of central importance in guiding human behaviour. The brain uses attention to enhance the processing of information that is behaviourally relevant, and to suppress irrelevant information. The operation of attention within sensory modalities (vision, touch, hearing) has been studied for many decades; however, little is known about how attention combines information between different senses. An understanding of 'crossmodal' attention is important for many reasons. First, real events in the environment provide inputs simultaneously from different locations to multiple senses, and these inputs must be integrated to yield coherent perception. Second, the most basic aspects of human perception depend upon attention; the brain implements selective mechanisms in order to filter the immense quantities of information that constantly bombard our sensory receptors. Finally, many neurological disorders are characterised by impairments of attention; these syndromes are debilitating for the patients themselves, and also place a heavy burden on caregivers and the healthcare system. This project will examine mechanisms of attention in healthy individuals and in stroke patients with attentional deficits. In all experiments, we will employ a new technique in neuroscience called 'transcranial magnetic stimulation' (TMS). TMS enables the safe and reversible stimulation of brain activity in humans. In the current project, we will use TMS with two broad objectives: (i) to determine the key brain areas involved in crossmodal attention in healthy individuals, and (ii) to treat attentional deficits that occur within and between the senses in stroke patients ('magnetic stimulation rehabilitation'). This research will provide important insights into the brain mechanisms that govern selective attention in the healthy brain, and will help guide future methods for managing and treating neurological disorders in which deficits of attention are prominent."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jason Mattingley","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020682","middle_name":"Brett","last_name":"Mattingley","source_individual_id":"RMIS123930","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jason Mattingley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82287","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Chris Chambers","data":{"first_name":"Chris","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018156","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chambers","source_individual_id":"RMIS2459829","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Chris Chambers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81645","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5358","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Addressing Multiple Risk Factors in Primary Health and Community Care settings: A Cluster-Randomised Trial","data":{"media_summary":"Physical activity","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Lifestyle factors","Preventative Medicine","Primary health care","Public Health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":290519,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Diabetes (type 2)","Diet","Hypertension","Osteoarthritis","Physical activity"],"scientific_title":"Addressing Multiple Risk Factors in Primary Health and Community Care settings: A Cluster-Randomised Trial","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Preventive Medicine","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Elizabeth Eakin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/290519","simplified_title":"Linking General Practice and Community Care to Promote Health Behaviour Change","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"765984.36","source_system":"The proposed study will evaluate an intervention designed to assist patients with chronic medical conditions to make lifestyle changes that will benefit their health and reduce the complications associated with their conditions.

loss of bone and weakening of the skeleton. Although there are currently therapies to reduce bone loss, no current treatment effectively reconstructs lost bone. In this project, which is designed to identify new genes that may in the future be targeted by drugs to reverse osteoporosis, we have identified specific sets of genes that appear to work together to increase bone formation. This proposal is aimed at characterising these genes and the ways in which they work to determine whether they may be good targets for new osteoporosis treatments. We will examine the patterns of these genes in bone. We will also use cell cultures in which bone forming cells develop and function, to determine when the genes are expressed and how they function. We will test the ability of the candidate genes to cause an increase in the amount of bone forming activity in these cell cultures. An increase in bone formation may be caused by an increase in the number bone-forming cells, an increase in the activity of the cells, a decrease in cell death, or a combination of these changes. Each possibility will be tested. This research is important because of the need for new osteoporosis therapies to repair weakened bones. The knowledge resulting from this proposal has the potential to provide an important contribution to skeletal health and thus aged health worldwide."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John

Thailand by filling important gaps in knowledge about the causes of disease and the possibility of effectively intervening to reduce them. Since the accuracy of the routine death registration system in Thailand is unknown, it cannot be confidently used to guide policy. The team will evaluate how accurately causes of death are being recorded, both in urban and rural areas. It will also calculate how much disease and injury in Thailand is being caused by major risk factors, such as tobacco and unsafe sex. Using this information the team will evaluate the effectiveness of the major interventions to reduces diseases and injuries from risk factors that are affordable and applicable in the Thai

NALFD is a spectrum of disease ranging from steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a condition associated with the development of fibrosis in the majority of individuals. Approximately 20% and 3% of adults are affected with NAFLD and NASH, respectively, and NAFLD is expected to become the next major liver epidemic facing the western world, far exceeding the prevalence of chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus. We obtained liver biopsies from patients with NAFLD, 80% of whom had NASH, and determined the expression profile analysis of each subject using 19,200 element microarrays. Our data demonstrates the concordant differential expression of 130 genes, in subjects with NAFLD that were categorizes into 6 major metabolic and regulatory pathways. Many of these genes represented uncharacterised genes. Utilising an extensive bioinformatics approach we have been able to define the genes and their protein product. The use of these proteins as a diagnostic tool for the detection of NAFLD forms the basis of a provisional patent application. However, measurements of protein levels in tissue and sera from patients with NAFLD are needed for the development of a diagnostic method. Such information would also provide significant insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The AIMS are: 1)����������������� Production of antibodies against proteins encoded by candidate genes ���������������� Expression profile of candidate genes 3)����������������� Expression of proteins encoded by candidate genes in patients with NAFLD"},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Powell","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044903","middle_name":"Ellen","last_name":"Powell","source_individual_id":"RMIS13575","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Powell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88622","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Peter Wilce","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0011061","middle_name":"","last_name":"Wilce","source_individual_id":"RMIS34632","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Peter Wilce"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79708","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Paul Kroon","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0008467","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kroon","source_individual_id":"RMIS39791","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Paul Kroon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78988","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Julie Jonsson","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002506","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Jonsson","source_individual_id":"5015557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Julie Jonsson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77348","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4585","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis - a new class of antibiotics","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["DNA replication","antibiotics","protein-protein interactions","rational drug design"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252972,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis - a new class of antibiotics","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biotechnology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"BIOTECHNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Paul Alewood","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252972","simplified_title":"Development of a new drugs for bacterial infections","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"120000","source_system":"Pioneering work by CSIRO scientists has identified specific peptide motifs in the DNA replication machinery of bacteria that are critical for the correct functioning of the organism. In collaboration with CI Alewood potent (Kd ~ nM) lead compounds that inhibit bacterial DNA replication have been designed and synthesised. Through the application of a number of novel bioinformatics approaches to the analysis of the complete genome sequences of bacteria, the key sites of interaction of a number of protein families (DNA synthesis and repair enzymes) with the beta subunit of bacterial DNA Polymerase III have been identified. The nature of the sites, and preliminary experimental data, suggests that the approach will be generally applicable to all species of bacteria. In addition a wide range of novel assays for the identification of inhibitors of the interaction of proteins with the beta subunit have been developed. In this proposal we wish to demonstrate that our in vitro nanomolar inhibitors of the beta subunit can inhibit bacterial cell growth. The development program proposes to develop methods and strategies to gain bacterial cell entry of inhibitors of the interaction of proteins with the beta subunit of bacterial DNA Polymerase III. Proof of concept will be demonstrated by inhibition of bacterial cell growth. Stable compounds with good binding characteristics and able to be taken up by cells will be developed based on structure-function assay results, structural studies and modelling of inhibitors bound to the target. Antimicrobial activity of compounds will be demonstrated in standard FDA approved NCLLS (National Centre of Clinical Laboratory Standards USA) tests.

Although there remains controversy about which enzyme is responsible in vivo for degrading membrane phospholipids to inflammatory mediators like arachidonate, PAF, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, etc. there is a consensus that blockade of phospholipid metabolism would represent a major advance on NSAIDs as antiinflammatory agents. No sPLA2-IIa inhibitor is available yet in man. We aim to create an attractive data package showing proof of concept for a potent new type of antiinflammatory drug.

method for quantifying bilateral oedema","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"180000","source_system":"Swelling of tissue due to fluid accumulation, known as oedema, is one of the earliest signs of diseases such as kidney failure, burn injury or lymphedema. All of these are not uncommon conditions. Lymphedema, for example, is a common sequela of radiotherapy or surgery in the treatment of malignancies such as breast, uterine, and prostatic carcinoma. It is reported to occur in up to 40% of patients depending on the type of surgery and whether or not the patient received radiotherapy. It is estimated that at any time 100000 women are suffering from post- mastectomy lymphedema in Australia alone. Treatment of breast cancer alone therefore, given the incidence of the disease, produces a large at-risk population. Add to this other causes of oedema and the magnitude of the problem becomes clearly apparent. The presence of chronic oedema is often a disfiguring and disabling disorder, usually accompanied by pain, recurrent infection, reduced mobility and impaired function. In acute oedema the problem often resolves with recovery from the underlying pathology. In chronic oedema, progression may be arrested by early intervention including complex physical therapy (exercise regimen, compression bandaging, and massage) which is effective in reducing limb volume, in improving the quality of life, function and body image of patients. Although the assessment of oedema is clearly of clinical importance, relatively few objective and accurate techniques for its measurement exist. Research conducted over the past decade by the applicants has pioneered the Use of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis for the assessment of lymphedema. This study aims to translate this basic research into clinical practice. Sensitivity and specificity studies will establish normative and threshold values for impedance measurements that can be used as presumptive indicators of oedema. User friendly technology and equipment suitable for clinical use will be developed which should improve treatment therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Brian

Our studies address this issue by examining thechanges of gene expression in response to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and therefore provide us with routes to therapies which are targetted against CF gene mediated inflammation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"David Hume","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0013804","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hume","source_individual_id":"RMIS29671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"David Hume"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80420","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Brandon Wainwright","data":{"first_name":"Brandon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010876","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Wainwright","source_individual_id":"RMIS3708556","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Brandon Wainwright"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79662","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4561","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Virtual Screening in Structure-Based Drug Design for Malaria","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["DRUG DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS","ENZYME INHIBITION","ENZYMOLOGY","PURINE METABOLISM","X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252900,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["INFECTION CONTROL","MALARIA","PARASITIC DISEASE"],"scientific_title":"Virtual Screening in Structure-Based Drug Design for Malaria","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Luke Guddat","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252900","simplified_title":"Computer based screening and synthesis of anti-malarial compounds","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"285000","source_system":"Malaria continues to be one of the most serious health problems in the world today with approximately 300 million people affected and 1.5 million recorded deaths per year.

Because of the parasite's increasing resistance to traditional medication, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. Two approaches are feasible: vaccines and new drugs. Both will probably be necessary to combat the spread and consequences of malaria. We are approaching this problem by targeting an enzyme which is essential for the survival of the parasite. All protozoan parasites make their purine nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA and RNA) by purine base salvage. Unlike humans, they cannot make purines from simple precursor molecules. The key enzyme in the salvage pathway is hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRT). Our plan is to capitalize on knowledge of the precise structure of HGXPRT and the increased power of computers to determine which chemicals are able to bind tightly and specifically to the active site of the enzyme. We will then test the ability of these compounds to inhibit purified human and Plasmodium enzymes and their ability to inhibit the growth of the malarial parasite in red cells. Chemical synthesis will be used to improve the effectiveness of these compounds."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Craig Williams","data":{"first_name":"Craig","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0046287","middle_name":"Mckenzie","last_name":"Williams","source_individual_id":"RMIS1751840","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Craig Williams"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88988","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Luke Guddat","data":{"first_name":"Luke","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031041","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Guddat","source_individual_id":"RMIS1125097","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Luke Guddat"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85040","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr John De Jersey","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018611","middle_name":"","last_name":"De Jersey","source_individual_id":"5014269","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"E/Pr John De Jersey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81769","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4560","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Virulence and oxidative stress in Streptococcus pneumoniae","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Gene regulation","Oxidative stress","Streptococcus pneumoniae","pathogenesis","psaA"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252886,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["bacterial virulence factors","respiratory tract infection","streptococcal disease"],"scientific_title":"Virulence and oxidative stress in Streptococcus pneumoniae","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Michael Jennings","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252886","simplified_title":"How the pathogenic bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, is affected by conditions of oxidative stress in the host.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"110125","source_system":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen that causes pneumonia, meningitis and bacteraemia as well as otitis media in young children. It is a cause of high morbidity and mortality around the world. S. pneumoniae grows by fermentative metabolism, a characteristic of anaerobic organisms, but it is able to adapt towards oxygen in the environment. This adaptive ability enables S. pneumoniae to live under conditions of high oxygen tension (eg. the upper respiratory tract) or under almost anaerobic conditions (eg. the middle ear) in the human body. The emergence of antibiotic resistant pneumococci and limitations of current vaccines has led to increased interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of this bacterium. Of particular interest has been the pneumococcal surface antigen PsaA, which has been shown to be a protective immunogen in mice. It has also been shown that psaA mutants exhibit massively reduced virulence in mice in intranasal and intraperitoneal challenge models. Taken together, these data have led to the suggestion that PsaA might be an effective vaccine antigen or antimicrobial target. We postulate that PsaA is involved in the oxidative stress response and virulence under aerobic conditions and have devised a study to determine the procise role of this protein in disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James Paton","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027246","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Paton","source_individual_id":"RMIS7494","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James Paton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84042","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Jennings","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025768","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Jennings","source_individual_id":"RMIS449244","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Jennings"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83637","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alastair Mcewan","data":{"first_name":"Alastair","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014843","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Mcewan","source_individual_id":"5016339","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alastair Mcewan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80715","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4559","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Multi-copper oxidase mediated iron uptake in Ps. aeruginosa and other pathogenic bacteria: mechanism and role in disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Iron uptake","Multi-copper oxidase","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","ferroxidse","pathoggensis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252885,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Cystic fibrosis","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","nosocomial Infection"],"scientific_title":"Multi-copper oxidase mediated iron uptake in Ps. aeruginosa and other pathogenic bacteria: mechanism and role in disease","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Alastair McEwan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252885","simplified_title":"A study of the mechanism and role of a new iron uptake pathway in bacteria that cause disease.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"73500","source_system":"Iron is essential for the growth of bacteria. One of the mechanisms used by humans (and other animals) to defend against bacteria that cause disease is to trap iron by binding it to a set of iron binding proteins eg. transferrin. In this way there is no free iron in the system, so bacteria that survive in humans have had to evolve specific mechanisms to remove the iron form these host proteins. The mechanisms of iron uptake in pathogenic bacteria have been studied extensively, and the iron uptake systems are considered to be important of virulence factors (bacterial factors essential for causing disease). Humans and other higher organisms like Yeast have an iron uptake system that uses multi copper oxidase proteins (MCOs). These proteins have a ferroxidase activity, which converts iron from a protein bound insoluable form Fe (III) to a soluble form Fe(II), allowing it to be released from iron binding proteins. We have searched the genomes of many bacteria for a similar system and have discovered that many bacteria have MCOs. We wanted to test the idea that the bacteria MCOs we have identified may be involved in iron uptkae. If so, it would represent a huge step forward in understanding this important process and could lead to products for prevention or better treatment of infectious disease. We chose the disease causing bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa for our study. We have shown that the MCO has ferroxidase activity (Fe(III)>Fe(II), we have made a mutation in the MCO gene had have shown that the bacterium lacking MCO will not grow under certain conditions. These conditions are consistent with a defect in iron uptake. We have identified but not characterised several other key compnents of this iron uptake system. In the proposed work we wish to investigate all of the components of this iron uptake system in this important pathogen, and to initiate studies in other bacteria pathogens."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Jennings","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025768","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Jennings","source_individual_id":"RMIS449244","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Jennings"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83637","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alastair Mcewan","data":{"first_name":"Alastair","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014843","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Mcewan","source_individual_id":"5016339","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alastair Mcewan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80715","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4558","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Migration and differentiation of dendritic cells and monocytes in inflammatory arthritis.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["cell migration","dendritic cell","monocyte","osteoclast","rheumatoid arthritis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252879,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["autoimmunity","immunotherapy","rheumatoid arthritis"],"scientific_title":"Migration and differentiation of dendritic cells and monocytes in inflammatory arthritis.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ranjeny Thomas","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252879","simplified_title":"Traffic of dendritic cells in arthritis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"280000","source_system":"Dendritic cells and monocytes are of critical importance to the development and persistence of inflammatory disease in rheumatoid arthritis.

With NHMRC support, we have been creating mice with individual signalling domains of the GH receptor deleted.

The work is important as it may help us better design new drugs and better choose which drugs to give and, if so, in what doses.

Estimation of liver function is particularly important in estimating whether there will be sufficient reserve on resection of a cancer or deciding if a liver transplant is needed. The liver is also a very complex organ which can trap or breakdown solutes by a range of different systems.

Obesity-associated liver disease occurs when the liver becoming resistance to the effects of insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar (glucose). In muscle and fat, insulin causes glucose to be taken into the tissues and stored. Glucose is made in the liver and the actions of insulin here are to turn off the release of glucose into the circulation and increase uptake and storage of glucose. Insulin resistance occurs in a number of situations but the most important of these is obesity, particularly when there is accumulation of fat inside the abdominal cavity. Although the liver has a central role in co-ordinating the bodies response to insulin, the mechanisms of insulin resistance in human liver are unknown. One prominent hypothesis is that fat molecules released by intra-abdominal fat deposits are responsible. Intra-abdominal fat stores are important because fatty acids from these deposits can travel directly to the liver with the blood supply from the gut. However the precise effects of these on insulin action in the liver are unknown. Fat tissue is actively involved in the regulation of metabolism and releases a number of regulatory proteins. One of these, adiponectin, appears to have an important role in improving insulin sensitivity in the liver. The production of adiponectin decreases as obesity increases, providing another link between obesity and insulin resistance in the liver. This project will examine insulin action and the signalling molecules responsible for this in human liver tissue. The project aims to determine the effect of obesity, particularly intra-abdominal fat deposits, on insulin responses in liver tissue. The studies also aim to confirm (or otherwise) the role of free fatty acids and adiponectin on insulin action in human liver.

Understanding of the various mechanisms involved in tumour spread, and targeting the functions of the domains has enormous potential as a therapeutic target."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Barbour","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035251","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Barbour","source_individual_id":"RMIS705983","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Barbour"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86137","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Toni Antalis","data":{"first_name":"Toni","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0029179","middle_name":"","last_name":"Antalis","source_individual_id":"RMIS218549","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Toni Antalis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84567","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Gotley","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025141","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Gotley","source_individual_id":"RMIS5900","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Gotley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83464","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jonathan Fawcett","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018949","middle_name":"","last_name":"Fawcett","source_individual_id":"RMIS4512205","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jonathan Fawcett"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81850","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4552","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Immunoregulatory immune responses to a peripherally presented tumour antigen","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Epithelium","Peripheral Tolerance","Tumour immunology","Viral oncogenesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252855,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Autoimmunity","Cervical cancer","Skin cancer"],"scientific_title":"Immunoregulatory immune responses to a peripherally presented tumour antigen","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Tumour Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ian Frazer","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252855","simplified_title":"How tumours persuade the immune system to ignore them","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"219750","source_system":"Tumours express proteins which the body can recognise as foreign.

Little is known about the effects of PAR2-activation in the native airways and intestinal tissues. These tissues will be studied in the present project. A large increase in PAR2 is found in various diseases which are paralleled by a strong inflammation. Thus, PAR2 is likely to play a central role in intestinal diseases such as acute infectious diarrhea and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. PAR2 may also participate in the severe diarrhea frequently observed in patients with intestinal tumors. Similarly, inflammatory mediators released during airway infections are likely to act on PAR2, causing inappropriate secretion and a running nose. Most importantly, PAR2 are found in large excess in the airways of asthma patients. Since nothing is known about the impact of these receptors on fluid and electrolyte transport in the airways it appears timely and highly relevant to study the function of PAR2 in the airway epithelium. We will assess PAR2 mediated responses in human nasal biopsies. A more detailed analysis of the intracellular processes will be done in mouse trachea. We will further study the function of PAR2 in the intestinal epithelium. Activation of the ion transport via PAR2 will be examined in the mouse distal colon and in human rectal biopsies.

Chronic inflammatory periodontal diseases are among the most common chronic infections with over one million Australians at risk of losing their teeth. Poor dental health and in particular chronic periodontitis is now consistently being associated with a number of other diseases and conditions including cardiovascular disease. In some studies the relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease is stronger than that for other risk factors such as smoking and high cholesterol. Periodontitis results from the inflammatory response to dental plaque. One of the major pathogens identified in dental plaque is P.gingivalis. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are expressed by cells on exposure to various forms of stress including temperature and injury. They participate in physiological processes such as the assembly, transport and protection of proteins from breakdown. There is a remarkable conservation in the structure of heat shock genes and HSP across species. Many pathogens including P.gingivalis bear antigens that are similar to human HSPand cross reactivity during infection may result in disease such as atherosclerosis. This study aims to test the hypothesis that cross reactivity between the bacterial antigens and HSP may explain the mechanism of the association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. This would have a significant impact on the treatment of both periodontal and cardiovascular disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Gregory Seymour","data":{"first_name":"Gregory","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0045362","middle_name":"","last_name":"Seymour","source_individual_id":"RMIS9783","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Gregory Seymour"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88735","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Philip Walker","data":{"first_name":"Philip","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022791","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS1116934","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Philip Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82875","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Erica Gemmell","data":{"first_name":"Erica","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0013197","middle_name":"","last_name":"Gemmell","source_individual_id":"RMIS9786","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Erica Gemmell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80264","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Mary Cullinan","data":{"first_name":"Mary","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012574","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Cullinan","source_individual_id":"RMIS222537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Mary Cullinan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80103","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Malcolm West","data":{"first_name":"Malcolm","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005385","middle_name":"J","last_name":"West","source_individual_id":"5018261","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Malcolm West"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78171","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4544","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Agonists and Antagonists Of The Human Complement C3a Receptor","data":{"media_summary":"sepsis","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Agonists and Antagonists","C3a and C5a","Human Complement","Immunoinflammatory Drugs","NMR structure"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252812,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["arthritis","asthma","inflammation","ischemia-reperfusion","sepsis"],"scientific_title":"Agonists and Antagonists Of The Human Complement C3a Receptor","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmacology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof David Fairlie","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252812","simplified_title":"Towards New Antiinflammatory Drugs Based On Human Immune Defence","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"473250","source_system":"Many serious inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, septic shock, lung shock, heart disease, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, are poorly controlled with currently available drugs.

One of the most important complement proteins is known as C3a. It is called an anaphylatoxin and is thought to be a pivotal component of the complement system synthesized by the human body early on in the development of inflammatory and immune diseases. New compounds that could stimulate or block the activity of C3a are expected : (a) To lead us to a better understanding of how C3a binds to its receptors on immune cells and its role in the immune response to infection and injury, and (b) To enable the rapid development of an entirely new class of drugs for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. No Complement-based drugs are yet available. It is not yet possible to examine detailed structures of the receptors on cells that interact with complement proteins. However it is possible to determine and analyse three dimensional structures of small molecules that can bind to human immune cells, and mimic or block effects of human C3a on cells, rat tissues, and in whole rats. We will identify and improve such small molecules by optimising their binding to immune cells, by tailoring them to selectively block or mimic just the effects of C3a, and by making them pharmacologically stable for administration (preferably by mouth) to rats (and humans). We will then test them in rats for potential future development into a completely new type of anti-inflammatory drug, one that treats inflammatory disease processes rather than just the symptoms like most current antiinflammatory drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Fairlie","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030610","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Fairlie","source_individual_id":"RMIS20617","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Fairlie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84952","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010587","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS41211","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79577","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4543","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Design and Development Of Small Molecules To Regulate Protease Activated Receptor Type 2","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Antagonists","Inflammation","Peptidomimetics","Pharmacology","Protease Activated Receptors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252811,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["arthritis","asthma","cancer","pancreatitis"],"scientific_title":"Design and Development Of Small Molecules To Regulate Protease Activated Receptor Type 2","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Fairlie","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252811","simplified_title":"New antiinflammatory drugs that regulate receptors on surfaces of cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"439500","source_system":"A new class of proteins have been discovered on the surface of cells.

This suggest that proteases may exert some of their biological effects through these receptors, which are now implicated in a growing number of diseases (e.g. thrombosis, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, pancreatitis, stomach and colon cancer, arthritis, and there may also be a role in wound healing). We are working towards dissecting the roles for one of these receptors (PAR2) in disease by developing small molecules for selective binding to this receptor. We will particularly distinguish between compounds that can activate (agonists) or deactivate (antagonists) the receptor. These experiments will involve computer-assisted compound design, structural comparisons between small molecules with activity and those without, and cellular studies designed to measure affinity, activation and deactivation of PAR2. The outcome will be a series of small molecules that bind tightly to the PAR2 receptor and have a well defined function (antagonist, agonist, partial agonist). While the above studies are in progress some peptides that are known to activate this receptor will be examined in rodent models of human disease (airways inflammation, pancreatitis, stomach and colon cancer, arthritis). Studies like this have been very revealing for us in the past (Nature 1999, 398, 156-160 A protective role for protease-activated receptors in the airways). Then the designed and developed compounds will also be examined for signs of therapeutic potential.

We recently discovered that cell surface E-cadherin is re-internalized and recycled back to the surface via a pathway that is poised to contribute to the regulation of cell adhesion. Our proposed studies aim to reveal how newly-synthesized E-cadherin and recycling E-cadherin are trafficked, which molecules and which vesicle carriers accomplish this transport. E-cadherin has specific amino acids that act as targeting signals for its sorting and trafficking; we have recently identified one such signal and will now seek the signal responsible for its endocytosis. Using specifically engineered mutants of E-cadherin we will also study other proteins that interact with E-cadherin during its trafficking for sorting and regulation. One of these is polycystin, a protein that is mutated in a common inherited kidney disease. Insights into this disease and normal kidney epithelial function will emerge from this work. A growing understanding of E-cadherin function and regulation is essential for the health of epithelial organs and for controlling and preventing cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Rohan Teasdale","data":{"first_name":"Rohan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0040022","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Teasdale","source_individual_id":"5017848","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Rohan Teasdale"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87368","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Stow","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004860","middle_name":"Lea","last_name":"Stow","source_individual_id":"RMIS42387","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Stow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78016","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4541","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Skin Disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252807,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Richard Sturm","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252807","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"572000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Richard Sturm","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045672","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Sturm","source_individual_id":"5017777","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Richard Sturm"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88811","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4540","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional analysis of candidate sex-determining and gonadal development genes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Developmental genes","Differential gene expression","Embryonic development","Murine models","Sex determination"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252788,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Embryonic development","Organogenesis","Sex reversal"],"scientific_title":"Functional analysis of candidate sex-determining and gonadal development genes","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

For example, frontal lobe dysfunction has been linked with the loss of ability to plan and organize information, seen in those who have schizophrenia. These measures may also help clarify the relationship between the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of these disorders. One of the best ways to investigate this relationship is the use of a twin study design. The Australian study of twins with psychosis will recruit dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs in which at least one twin is affected by a psychotic disorder, plus control twin pairs matched for age, sex and zygosity. Measures derived from MRI scans will be collected in an attempt to further define specific brain regions reported to be different in psychosis. In addition Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will be used to visualize white matter tracts in the brain. The twin study design will allow us to differentiate genetic and environmental factors associated with these brain measures and help evaluate the potential for these measures to genetically define sub-groups of individuals with psychotic disorders. The identification of these subgroups would facilitate the search for susceptibility genes. Additionally, this study will help clarify the possible clinical overlap between affective (i.e. bipolar affective disorder) and non-affective (i.e. schizophrenia) psychotic disorders.

Several problems have been identified in the muscle system in persons who suffer from neck pain. Therapeutic exercise has been found to have benefit in preventing and relieving pain and improving the neck function. Currently there are several, quite different methods of exercise and there is controversy regarding how therapeutic exercise works. It has been argued that parameters such as changes in muscle strength, endurance, joint position sense or muscle coordination may be responsible for the clinical efficacy. It is difficult to disentangle the effective component of exercise strategies and thus prescribe the most effective exercise strategies. This series of experiments will evaluate the physiological factors that change with a specific exercise intervention and to compare different exercise modalities in order to identify the most effective means to induce these changes. Cervical muscle training, using a proven exercise intervention strategy for chronic neck pain and headache, has been chosen as the model to investigate these questions. This exercise strategy has been chosen not only because it has been shown to be effective, but also because it does not conform to contemporary rationales for strength or endurance training. Thus while effective in relieving pain, it is unlikely to produce changes in these parameters. Thus other mechanisms are likely to be responsible for the clinical change. This research stands to make a significant contribution to exercise therapeutics by identifying the effective components of different exercise methods and investigating the pain relieving effects of the specific exercise. This knowledge will lead to the construction of a research based exercise program for neck pain patients, rather than have the current situation of often arbitrary choice of exercise."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Guglielmo Vicenzino","data":{"first_name":"Guglielmo","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0046019","middle_name":"Tarcisio","last_name":"Vicenzino","source_individual_id":"5018115","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Guglielmo Vicenzino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88911","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Hodges","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043077","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Hodges","source_individual_id":"RMIS222953","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Hodges"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88164","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Gwendolen Jull","data":{"first_name":"Gwendolen","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019981","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Jull","source_individual_id":"RMIS5215","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Gwendolen Jull"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82087","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4535","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular genetics of macrophage activation.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["differentiation","genetics","lipopolysaccharide","macrophage","transcription"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252765,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["cancer","genetics","inflammation"],"scientific_title":"Molecular genetics of macrophage activation.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof David Hume","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252765","simplified_title":"Inherited variation in the innate immune response.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"425250","source_system":"This project concerns the basic biology of white blood cells called macrophages.

Some signals tell cells to grow and divide and other signals tell cells to rest. These signals are usually in balance in healthy cells. To prevent cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled manner and forming a cancer, there are mechanisms to turn off signals for growth. One mechanism is to destroy the proteins responsible for growth signalling. This involves flipping (by a process called multivesicular body, or MVB, sorting) the signalling protein from one side of the membrane where signalling occurs to the other side where signalling cannot occur and where the signalling protein can be degraded. Interestingly, it has recently been discovered that some viruses (including the AIDS virus) use the same MVB sorting mechanisms to escape from infected cells. Instead of undergoing MVB sorting into an internal compartment and getting degraded, however, the virus is able to use the same mechanism to flip out of the cell. How MVB sorting occurs is not known, but the mechanism has been conserved through evolution and even microbes like yeast can perform MVB sorting of proteins. We are investigating a component of the MVB sorting mechanism known as Vps4 which is present in both human cells and in yeast cells. Since the human Vps4 and yeast Vps4 seem to function in the same way, and since powerful molecular genetic approaches can be used in yeast to elucidate how proteins function (some of which are not possible with human cells), we are using yeast to investigate Vps4 function. Once we understand how the yeast Vps4 works, we will be able to test if human Vps4 works the same way. Understanding the MVB sorting mechanism will give us information on how cells prevent uncontrolled growth and division and may also help us find ways of preventing AIDS infection."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Alan Munn","data":{"first_name":"Alan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038670","middle_name":"Leslie","last_name":"Munn","source_individual_id":"RMIS1725772","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Alan Munn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87019","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4533","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular basis of dengue virus-induced fusion","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["antiviral agents","dengue virus","envelope protein","membrane fusion","protein structure"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252739,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["antiviral drug","dengue fever","infectious disease","vaccine"],"scientific_title":"Molecular basis of dengue virus-induced fusion","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Paul Young","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252739","simplified_title":"Understanding how dengue virus enters cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"410250","source_system":"Dengue viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and cause major epidemics in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical regions. Infection with Dengue viruses cause Dengue fever or its more severe and sometimes fatal form, Dengue hemmorrhagic fever-Dengue shock syndrome (DHF-DSS). Up to 100 million people are infected annually making Dengue virus one of the most important and frequent mosquito-borne viral diseases worldwide. Over the past two decades, the incidence of Dengue virus infection has increased steadily. More than 40% of the world's population is at risk of infection and this number is expected to increase as more people travel. This proposal focuses on the way dengue virus enters cells, specifically the mechanism used by viral proteins to mediate fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell.

In addition, we will also use this information in the design and generation of new vaccine candidates."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bostjan Kobe","data":{"first_name":"Bostjan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031827","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kobe","source_individual_id":"5011436","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Bostjan Kobe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85237","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Young","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005625","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Young","source_individual_id":"RMIS20614","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Young"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78234","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4530","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structural biology","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["molecular biology","treatments"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252736,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Structural biology","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"","cia_name":"Prof Bostjan Kobe","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252736","simplified_title":"Structural biology","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"453000","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bostjan Kobe","data":{"first_name":"Bostjan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0031827","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kobe","source_individual_id":"5011436","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Bostjan Kobe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85237","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4529","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structure and Gene Regulation of Human Glutathione Transferase GSTT1-1","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Enzyme regulation","Enzyme structure","Promotor analysis","Xenobiotic & drug metabolism: glutathione transferases"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252735,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Cancer susceptibility","Drug resistamce in cancer","Neurodegenerative diseases","Occupational health"],"scientific_title":"Structure and Gene Regulation of Human Glutathione Transferase GSTT1-1","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Toxicology (incl.

They belong to the phase II enzymes of the xenobiotic metabolism and conjugate a wide range of drugs and chemicals with glutathione to increase water solubility and thereby enhancing their elimination. The conjugation with glutathione is considered an important detoxification route for most chemicals. However, it has been shown that in many cases this pathway leads to metabolites that are more toxic than the initial chemical or drug. The gene deletion of the particular human GSTT1 gene results in total loss of this particular enzyme activity in all tissues of homozygous null genotype individuals. This phenotype is called non-conjugator . Non-conjugators seem to have a higher risk to develop certain cancer types, e.g. urinary bladder cancer or brain tumours, while they seem to be less susceptible for others, e.g. liver. Occupational exposure to chemicals is of relevance in such relationships because the GSTT1 enzyme metabolises a wide range of industrial chemicals including solvents but also monomers used in the production of rubbers and other polymers. In addition, GSTT1 seems to influence the efficay of cancer chemotherapy by inactivating certain anti-cancer drugs, eg. BCNU, that is predominantly use in treatment of brain tumours. The aims of this study include the characterisation of the tissue-specific activity and the influence of xenobiotics on the protein levels of this enzyme. The study leads to a better understanding of the etiology of exposure related cancers and of the mechanisms of resistance to cancer chemotherapy. Such knowledge allows the development of concepts for the optimisation of efficacy and minimisation of side effects in chemotherapy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ricarda Thier","data":{"first_name":"Ricarda","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028359","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thier","source_individual_id":"RMIS1086167","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ricarda Thier"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84330","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4528","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structure, function and regulation of human cytosolic sulfotransferases","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Drug conjugation","Molecular pharmacology","Structure-activity relationships","Toxicology","Xenobiotic metabolism"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252734,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Drug metabolism and xenobiotics","Drug toxicity","Pharmacology - toxicology","Sulfation"],"scientific_title":"Structure, function and regulation of human cytosolic sulfotransferases","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Toxicology (incl.

Observations from clinical studies suggest that differences in sulfotransferases activities may be a causal factor in the incidence of certain types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in understanding the molecular biology of these enzymes have shown us that multiple forms of sulfotransferase existed within the body. In this area my laboratory has been at the forefront of the cloning and characterisation of these enzymes. Indeed, we were the first laboratory to clone the major human sulfotransferase (SULT1A3) responsible for the metabolism of brain neurotransmitters. We have also used new technology to determine the shape of this important enzyme. At the time of writing my laboratory has characterised a total seven human sulfotransferases but unlike SULT1A3, our knowledge of the functional significance of the other six sulfotransferase is poorly understood. Further, our knowledge of what regulates the amount of sulfotransferase in different tissues is practically nonexistent. The thrust of this project is to extend our studies on the physiological function of these enzymes and also through the use of molecular biology techniques understand what controls the level of their expression in different human tissues. This knowledge will provide a basis for understanding the role of sulfotransferases play in drug and chemical metabolism. It will also aid our understanding of their role in hormone and neurotransmitter metabolism and help determine whether they are involved in such diseases as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mick Mcmanus","data":{"first_name":"Mick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020792","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mcmanus","source_individual_id":"RMIS1086175","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mick Mcmanus"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82320","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4527","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A multiple antigen lipophilic adjuvant carrier (MALAC) system","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Adjuvant carrier system","Drug Delivery","Enhanced immunogenicity","Lipoamino acids","Multiple-antigen-lipophilic-adjuvant-carrier (MALAC)"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252733,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Group A Streptococcal Peptide Vaccine","Immunisation","Oral Vaccination","Safe and Controlled Vaccine Design"],"scientific_title":"A multiple antigen lipophilic adjuvant carrier (MALAC) system","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Istvan TOTH","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252733","simplified_title":"A novel immunoadjuvant system","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"141500","source_system":"We have developed a Multiple-Antigen-Lipophilic-Adjuvant-Carrier (MALAC) system, based on the incorporation of lipoamino acids into a poly-functional core that provides an excellent means for enhancing the antigenicity of a potential peptide vaccine.

The key of this system is a novel carrier construct, which is non-toxic and non-immunogenic. The system contains variables, which allow optimising its structural configuration. A small library of poly-functional MALAC system will be synthesised in a controlled step-by-step way combining solution or solid phase techniques, where the exact chemical structure (and the order of the different immunological peptide sequences) of the construct is pre-determined. The antigenicity and the protection against disease will be compared with antigenicity and protection generated using conventional vaccine carriers. We also aim to exploit the particulate-forming properties of the lipo-peptide amphiphiles, to form micro-particulate oral antigens, exploiting the phenomenon of particulate uptake from the GI tract by the GALT or other intestinal sites. The MALAC constructs will be administered orally followed by the measurement of the serum IgG. Vaccination via the oral route is highly desirable, since it can overcome many of the disadvantages inherent in administration by injection - e.g. poor patient acceptability, requirement of skilled medical personnel, risk of HIV and other blood-born diseases, restricted availability and sometimes, stimulation of the wrong type of immunity. Development of vaccines for oral administration make them much more widely available, permitting self-administration and improving the operation of Public-Health vaccination programs, particularly in developing countries."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Istvan Toth","data":{"first_name":"Istvan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034329","middle_name":"","last_name":"Toth","source_individual_id":"RMIS17214","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Istvan Toth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85883","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4526","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"preclinical","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Pharmacology","Treatments"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252720,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"preclinical","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmacology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Ronald Dickinson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252720","simplified_title":"preclinical","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"707250","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ronald Dickinson","data":{"first_name":"Ronald","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036292","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Dickinson","source_individual_id":"RMIS8307","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ronald Dickinson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86406","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4525","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Implementation and evaluation of a diabetes intervention program in indigenous Australian Communities.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["health education","indigenous health","lifestyle factors","primary health care"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252719,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["diabetes (type 2)","life-skills development","primary health care in indigenous communities"],"scientific_title":"Implementation and evaluation of a diabetes intervention program in indigenous Australian Communities.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Indigenous Health","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Joanne Shaw","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252719","simplified_title":"The impact of a lifestyle change program in Aboriginal people with Type 2 diabetes.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"173625","source_system":"Approximately 700,000 Australians have type 2 diabetes (also termed maturity-onset diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes), which is a condition associated with reduced lifespan, eye disease, heart disease, renal disease, stroke, and foot complications leading to amputation.

This research program will find genes which cause diabetes by searching for them in indigenous Australian pedigrees in which many of the family members are affected by diabetes. Finding the genes which cause diabetes will have significant impact in at least three major ways. Firstly, it will increase our understanding of the disease process.

Lateral epicondylalgia (tennis elbow) is such a condition and is often treated in primary care. Both the individual and community are affected by this condition: 7 per 1000 patients seeing their medical doctor have this condition. Most are not tennis related. On average 10-30% of sufferers take 12 weeks off work. The condition may last 6-48 months and it tends to become stubborn to treatment and recurs often. Two popular treatment options that are commonly prescribed for the management of lateral epicondylalgia are physiotherapy and corticosteroid injections. To date there is little evidence supporting physiotherapy, especially current best practice methods such as manual therapy and therapeutic exercise. The lack of evidence is largely due to a small number of studies of physiotherapy, most of which are of poor quality and of treatments that are currently deemed to be less than optimal. A larger number of studies of corticosteroid injections have shown that corticosteroid injections are beneficial in the short term (3-6 weeks), but not over 12 months where they are associated with greater recurrence rates. Manual therapy has been shown to have short term pain relieving effects and therapeutic exercise exerts long standing improvements in this condition. It is proposed that the addition of manual therapy to therapeutic exercise will have superior short- and long-term effects. This project will conduct a randomised clinical trial to evaluate this proposition and also the factors associated with success, failure or recurrence rates. A cost-benefit analysis will also be conducted to calculate the relative economic merits of the treatments. A tangible outcome of this project will be the development of clinical guidelines for the most effective method of treating lateral epicondylalgia in primary health care."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Guglielmo Vicenzino","data":{"first_name":"Guglielmo","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0046019","middle_name":"Tarcisio","last_name":"Vicenzino","source_individual_id":"5018115","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Guglielmo Vicenzino"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88911","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Brooks","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035559","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Brooks","source_individual_id":"5013624","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Brooks"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86210","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Gwendolen Jull","data":{"first_name":"Gwendolen","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019981","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Jull","source_individual_id":"RMIS5215","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"E/Pr Gwendolen Jull"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82087","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4521","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Genetic programs regulated by the nuclear hormone receptor, LXR, in muscle: control of cholesterol and lipid metabolism","data":{"media_summary":"Obesity","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Expression Profiling and Gene Arrays","Gene Regulation","Nuclear Hormone Receptors","Skeletal Muscle Metabolism","Steroid Receptors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252702,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Biological Science","Cardiovascular disease","Dyslipidemia","Endocrine diseases and Diabetes","Obesity"],"scientific_title":"Genetic programs regulated by the nuclear hormone receptor, LXR, in muscle: control of cholesterol and lipid metabolism","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof George Muscat","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252702","simplified_title":"Understanding how cholesterol regulates lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"425250","source_system":"The heightened occurrence of cardiovascular disease has been linked to disorders in lipid metabolism.

Disorders of lipid metabolism are associated with cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance-diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Raised levels of serum TGs, and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are characteristic of lipotoxic diseases. HDLs have a defensive role in the prevention of atherogenic dyslipidemia by mediating cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues through the hormone -dependent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters back to the liver for excretion and elimination. Agents that raise the levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) through cholesterol efflux provide a pharmaceutical solution for the prevention of hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic and cardiovascular disease. These hormone dependent cholesterol and lipid effluxing proteins are regulated by a protein named LXR. Understanding the functional role of LXR in skeletal muscle, a peripheral tissue that accounts for 40% of total body weight is of paramount importance in understanding whole body cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, LXR and LXR target genes that facilitate cholesterol efflux and consequently raise HDLc levels are important pharmaceutical targets.

This project is designed to generate a mouse model of this disease to investigate cancer susceptibility in carriers of the defective gene. The specific mutation to be introduced into the mouse has been described in a patient with breast cancer and it has been shown to interfere with the normal function of the ATM protein. The mouse model is expected to reflect closely the human disease and will provide the opportunity to monitor heterozygous carriers for the development of cancer. This model is expected to confirm the observations in humans and provide a resource to understand susceptibility to develop cancer.

A patent application covers an apparatus and test to measure the switching rate between the hemispheres and the way in which such measurements can be used as a means to diagnose bipolar disorder (BD). BD, also called manic depression, is a form of depression that currently affects over six million people worldwide with about three million in the USA alone. The condition has phases of mania and depression and periods of remittance. Full cycles of BD can occur as many as three times a year and for many patients, this is a lifelong condition. BD is effectively treated, once it is diagnosed. It is estimated that 20% of sufferers go undiagnosed and many more are misdiagnosed. The cost of mis- or non-diagnosis is measured by suicides, the financial burden on society with health care, loss of productivity etc, effects on family and associates, crime, etc. Diagnosis to date is achieved mainly by subjective means such as questionnaires. These instruments do not conclusively separate BD from other forms of depression and schizophrenia, for which treatment is quite different. Nor do they allow for factors such as substance abuse and other medical conditions that the patient may be suffering. BD is hereditary with the slow hemispheric switch rate being an indicator of the genetic trait. This phenomenon allows for an objective test for BD, even if an individual has not had an episode of BD. The slow switch allows relatively easy separation of a BD patient from those exhibiting symptoms that may have other causes."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"John Pettigrew","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0015559","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pettigrew","source_individual_id":"RMIS31384","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"John Pettigrew"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80922","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3969","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Methodology for population health research: training and innovation in longitudinal studies","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Longitudinal study","biostatistical methods","population health","record linkage","social research"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252834,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Methodology for population health research: training and innovation in longitudinal studies","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Gail Williams","higher_grant_type":"Capacity","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252834","simplified_title":"Methodology for longitudinal population health research","sub_type":"Population Health Capacity Building Grant","total_budget":"1963750","source_system":"This proposal builds on the applicants' experience with existing cohort studies to identify, evaluate and address areas of methodological concern, particularly with longitudinal studies.

Although many are detected by the ~50,000 prenatal tests currently performed annually in Australia, these methods are only offered to high risk mothers because they are invasive (~1% risk of miscarriage), and-or expensive. A rapid, low cost, less invasive and safer alternative prenatal diagnostic method such as PAP smears that could be offered to all mothers regardless of risk is therefore of immense value both to mothers and to the health care system. This proposal enhances first trimester screening by improving prenatal diagnosis from PAP smears. Although normally taken to detect cancer, these smears contain significant numbers of foetal cells. We will investigate: the best way and time to obtain these cells, the best way to remove the cells from any contamination, improvements in genetic diagnosis of these cells using a technique known as MF-PCR which is rapidly revolutionising conventional prenatal diagnosis. By automating these procedures, they will become less expensive and more accessible to all mothers regardless of risk. We will also compare these procedures with alternative first trimester screening techniques such as nuchal translucency to determine the value of both tests singly and in combination. This research should provide a safe, reliable and accurate method allowing inexpensive prenatal screening to be available for all pregnancies. General screening programmes using this new test, particularly if combined with nuchal translucency programmes, would result in a dramatic reduction in affected babies with major implications to families and the health care system."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ian Findlay","data":{"first_name":"Ian","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042373","middle_name":"","last_name":"Findlay","source_individual_id":"RMIS510603","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Ian Findlay"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87992","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Fung Yee Chan","data":{"first_name":"Fung Yee","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041537","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chan","source_individual_id":"RMIS194284","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Fung Yee Chan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87778","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3967","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Optimising Cognitive Screening in General Practice","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["ageing","cognitive impairment","memory"],"nhmrc_grant_id":252704,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Optimising Cognitive Screening in General Practice","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Learning, Memory, Cognition and Language","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"PSYCHOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Michael Humphreys","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/252704","simplified_title":"Memory Screening in General Practice","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"300550","source_system":"Within the next 5 - 10 years it is likely that sophisticated combination pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease will become available. Once intervention agents are available that affect the underlying disease process, it will be critical to accurately identify those patients who are in the earliest stages of cognitive decline. That is, failure to detect cognitive decline at an early stage will reduce the effectiveness of the intervention and be costly to the individual and society. At the same time, the probability of falsely identifying an individual as having Alzheimer's disease needs to be reduced in order to avoid unnecessary testing, anxiety and distress, and expense. A sophisticated and highly flexible testing system to detect the earliest stages of memory impairment will be developed. The test will be administered over the web in a general practitioner's surgery enabling the collection of normative data on the population of greatest interest (elderly patients seeing their doctor). Voice recognition technology will be used in order to insure a user friendly environment. Stringent procedures to protect privacy will be employed. The test will be inexpensive and easy to take and will allow valid retesting so that it can be used as part of the routine health screening for the elderly. This will be a far more sensitive and specific indicator of the cognitive decline found in most neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, and will enable general practitioners to be more confident in assessing their older patients. It will also reduce costly referrals by more accurately identifying those patients at risk. It is expected that the test will find acceptance amongst patients and their doctors and become a routine part of normal health screening for the elderly."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christopher Del Mar","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041984","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Del Mar","source_individual_id":"RMIS2365573","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Christopher Del Mar"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87888","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gerard Byrne","data":{"first_name":"Gerard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0023904","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Byrne","source_individual_id":"5013745","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Gerard Byrne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83133","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Humphreys","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008036","middle_name":"S","last_name":"Humphreys","source_individual_id":"RMIS1713125","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Humphreys"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78874","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Gerald Tehan","data":{"first_name":"Gerald","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004968","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tehan","source_individual_id":"RMIS1713135","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Gerald Tehan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78047","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nancy Pachana","data":{"first_name":"Nancy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003819","middle_name":"Ann","last_name":"Pachana","source_individual_id":"RMIS1713128","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Nancy Pachana"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77727","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3966","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Checkpoint restart: coordinating completion of DNA repair with cell cycle progression.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Cdc25","Cell cycle","Chk1","DNA damage","G2 checkpoint"],"nhmrc_grant_id":220001,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Checkpoint restart: coordinating completion of DNA repair with cell cycle progression.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Or, they will drive the car to work instead of walking to the bus or train. Or, they send off e-mails instead of walking down the corridor at work. The result is that people are not using up the energy that they should and they get fatter. The average weight of many groups of Australians has gone up by several kilograms in the past 10 years. Active people not only have healthier weights. They are less likely to get heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. But too many people do no exercise at all. Only about 10% of Australians adults do fitness and sporting activities three or more times a week. More than half do not walk, cycle or do anything moderately active on any regular basis. To get people to be regularly active and to stay active, promoting deliberate 'exercise' is not the answer. Making it easier for people to choose to be more active as they go about their daily lives will be more effective. Road transport researchers and geographers have a lot to offer to health researchers. They have found that where there are footpaths and cycle ways, where shops and businesses are close by or where the roads make it easy and safe to get from place to place, people are much more likely to walk or ride bikes. We can now use large, complex computerised databases (called Geographic Information Systems) to put together this type of information on peoples' local environments. We will combine these 'geographic' data with other information from surveys on people's physical activity, exercise and transport habits. Starting our research in this way, we will be able to work out whether there are factors in people's local environments that really do make them less active. Governments, health planners and local councils will use this information to find ways to create communities that are more activity-friendly. This will have real health benefits."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graeme Hugo","data":{"first_name":"Graeme","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037413","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hugo","source_individual_id":"5015378","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Graeme Hugo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86693","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Adrian Bauman","data":{"first_name":"Adrian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035294","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Bauman","source_individual_id":"5012367","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Adrian Bauman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86147","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Neville Owen","data":{"first_name":"Neville","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003812","middle_name":"Gordon","last_name":"Owen","source_individual_id":"5016815","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Neville Owen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77725","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3627","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase regulation and function - effect of genetic poymorphisms.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Drug metabolism","Drug toxicity","Enzyme polymorphism"],"nhmrc_grant_id":212066,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Drug metabolism","Metabolic polymorphisms","acetylation","enzymes"],"scientific_title":"Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase regulation and function - effect of genetic poymorphisms.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Rod Minchin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/212066","simplified_title":"How is the enzyme arylamine N-acetyltransferase controlled in humans","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"421980","source_system":"How we handle chemicals that enter our bodies depends on a series of enzymes that are responsible for breaking down the chemicals and eliminating them. The activity of many of these enzymes varies between individuals so our responses to chemicals and drugs is different for each individual. Some of the enzymes vary because of inherited mutations, but others vary because of the diets we eat and the environment in which we live. This project will investigate a major enzyme called acetlytransferase that has been implicated as a risk factor in diseases such as cancer, asthma, liver cirrhossis and adverse drug reactions. We plan to look at the enzyme in cells and determine what environmental factors contribute to its variation between individuals, and how this impacts on the genetic mutations that have been found in its gene. From these studies, we will have a much better undersanding of how different people metabolise foreign chemicals, and should be able to predict those most at risk of certain

Grant","total_budget":"392640","source_system":"Gene expression involves the transfer of information from DNA to proteins and is mediated by a third molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). The process is tightly controlled since unregulated gene expression is harmful and can result in diseases such as developmental disorders and cancer. The genetic information in DNA is first copied to an RNA molecule in a process called transcription. This RNA molecule then undergoes a series of maturation steps before the information it carries can be translated into a protein. One of these maturation steps involves the removal of sequences (called introns) that do not contain protein coding information from the sequences (called exons) that will be present in the mature mRNA. Some genes contain no introns while others contain 20 or more, which are dispersed throughout the gene. The removal of intron sequences from immature RNA molecules is called splicing and is carried out by a macromolecular complex that recognises the intron sequences, cuts them out of the RNA and then rejoins the RNA to make a contiguous sequence. This process has to be precise otherwise spurious sequences will be present in the mRNA, which will result in the production of abnormal proteins. In addition, for some genes mRNAs are produced that have differences in a portion of their sequence. These alternative sequences are generated by the inclusion or exclusion of alternative exons. Because, RNA splicing is critical to the production of mature mRNAs and because it can generate sequence diversity it is tightly regulated. We have recently found that expression of a cancer gene (called GLI1) is regulated in part by the use of alternative GLI1 mRNAs. Moreover, we found that the expression of one of these alternative GLI1 mRNAs is associated with skin cancer. In this project we will investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing in GLI1 and identify whether changes in these mechanisms result in cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Smith","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045515","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"RMIS6441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88776","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joseph Rothnagel","data":{"first_name":"Joseph","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009982","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Rothnagel","source_individual_id":"5017267","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joseph Rothnagel"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79410","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3480","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Glycosylation of pili in pathogenic Neisseria: function in disease and potential as a vaccine antigen","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Neisseria gonorrhoeae","Neisseria meningitidis","Type 4 fimbriae (pili)","Virulence factor","glycosylation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210310,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["gonorrhoea","meningitis","pelvic inflamatory disease"],"scientific_title":"Glycosylation of pili in pathogenic Neisseria: function in disease and potential as a vaccine antigen","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Bacteriology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Michael Jennings","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210310","simplified_title":"How and why bacteria responsible for meningitis and gonorrhoeae modify surface proteins by the addition of sugars.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"150880","source_system":"Disease caused by Group B Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae remain a significant health problem worldwide. There are currently no vaccines available for either of these bacteria. A surface structure found on these bacteria, called pili, are key in host colonisation and disease. Genetics and structural studies have identified that the protein subunits, which make up pili, are glycosylated - modified by the addition of sugars. The role of glycosylation in the disease process is not known. It is possible that the glycosylation of pili is required for attachment to host cells or perhaps in evasion of the immune system. In our current studies, we have identified and analysed a number of genes involved in pili glycosylation, in bacteria which make structre that are know. We have also identified a series of new genes we believe are also involved in glycosylation. Some of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of unknown structures and are common in bacteria isolated from patients with meningitis. We will identify these stuctures and characterise bacteria in which these genes have been inactivated so that we can examine the role of pili glycosylation in colonisation and disease. This study has the potential to yield important new information about the process of colonisation and disease, and also has the potential to facilitate novel approaches in vaccine development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Jennings","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0025768","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Jennings","source_individual_id":"RMIS449244","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Jennings"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83637","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3479","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2-dependent mRNA trafficking in the cytoplasm of cells.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["cytoplasmic mRNA trafficking","heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins","myelin basic protein","neurons","protein targeting"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210308,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cancer","multiple sclerosis","nervous system development","rheumatoid arthritis"],"scientific_title":"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2-dependent mRNA trafficking in the cytoplasm of cells.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ross Smith","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210308","simplified_title":"RNA transport in the cytoplasm of cells.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"346650","source_system":"Control of the use of DNA, gene expression, is vital to all living organisms, especially in development and disease. The information in the genes of DNA is transferred to an intermediate molecule, mRNA, in a process called transcription. The genetic information in the mRNA is subsequently used to make the protein encoded by the original gene. The switching on and off of DNA appears to be most frequently controlled at the transcription step but recently it has become apparent that there are many post-transcriptional events that govern how efficiently the genetic information is ultimately converted to protein molecules. The RNA molecules may be confined to a small region of the cell, resulting in the localization of the protein produced from it; the RNA may be rapidly degraded or stabilized; and the efficiency of production of the protein from its RNA precursor may be modulated by other molecules. It had previously been shown that the mRNA encoding a protein that is an essential structural component of central nervous system myelin is selectively transported to the regions in the cell where the myelin is made. We have identified the molecule that recognises this RNA as a protein called hnRNP A2 and shown how it selects the RNA molecules that have to be transported from the myriad of RNA moleclues in the cell at any given time. hnRNP A2 was previously thought to be confined to the nuclei of cells, but we have shown that it is also present outside the nucleus and is involved in RNA transport in a variety of cell types. hnRNP A2 appears to be directly involved in rheumatoid arthritis, lung cancer and other cancers. It has been proposed as a diagnostic test for cancer as elevated intracellular levels and circulating antibodies against this protein appear before the cancerous cells are visible under the microscope. The major aim of the proposed project is to explore the molecular mechanism by which hnRNP A2 transports RNA molecules in cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ross Smith","data":{"first_name":"Ross","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045515","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"RMIS6441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ross Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88776","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3478","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Engineering subtype selective inhibitors of voltage-sensitive sodium channels","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["electrophysiology","molecular pharmacology","peptide structure activity relationships","sodium channel therapeutics"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210307,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["epilepsy","neuropathic pain","stroke"],"scientific_title":"Engineering subtype selective inhibitors of voltage-sensitive sodium channels","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Richard Lewis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210307","simplified_title":"Developing selective inhibitors of sodium channels","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"406980","source_system":"During efforts to find new inhibitors of voltage sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs), we have discovered two new families of mu-conotoxins from Australian Conus tulipa and C. striatus that inhibit neuronal and muscle forms of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium channel. From these and related analogues we have identified a number of selective and highly potent inhibitors of VSSCs, opening the possibility of producing the first subtype selective TTX-S inhibitors useful in diseases such as epilepsy and stroke. These analogues also showed high selectivity for TTX-S sodium channels over a TTX-resistant (TTX-R) subtype hPN3, a key channel involved in the transmission of neuropathic pain that we recently cloned from human dorsal root ganglia. Given that TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels have the same overall structure but differ at a relatively small number of key positions likely to affect mu-conotoxin binding, we believe it is possible to reverse engineer mu-conotoxin pharmacology in favour of the TTX-R form. This project will engineer subtype specific inhibitors of sodium channels in nerves through an understanding of how and wheremu-conotoxin bind to the sodium channel. Our long-term goal is to produce sodium channel drug candidates using m-conotoxins as templates for the development of subtype selective inhibitors of TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels.

The mental health of young people is one such area. Based on data relating to youth suicide, substance abuse, cigarette smoking by females and behavioural or mental health problems in the young, there has been evidence of a marked increase in some important health problems faced by the young. Little is known about the causes of these problems and even less is known about the reasons for the increase. Based on the available evidence, 20-25% of young persons manifest a mental health problem. A second area of marked health deterioration concerns youth (and adult) obesity. Existing research points to the accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity from a very early age. Over 10% of youth are obese and a substantially higher proportion are overweight. There is evidence that the rate of obesity has been substantially increasing. Again little is known about the factors that contribute to obesity or the causes of the increase in the rates of obesity in the population. This proposal is for a 21-year follow-up of a sample of youth first enrolled when their mothers attended for their first obstetrical visit. Using a substantial body of existing data, we propose to examine the changes in levels of mental health and obesity and to identify the factors which contribute to these changes. This study involves the largest Australian cohort ever assembled for such research. The main questions asked in this study concern the impact of the mother's social and economic circumstances, her physical health and well-being, her use of addictive substances (including alcohol, cigarettes, illicit drugs) on the youth's health. We will also examine the association between early indicators of mental health and well-being and subsequent youth health and development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael O'Callaghan","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044590","middle_name":"James","last_name":"O'Callaghan","source_individual_id":"RMIS1119732","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael O'Callaghan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88543","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Margaret Andersen","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0035089","middle_name":"","last_name":"Andersen","source_individual_id":"RMIS1119737","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Margaret Andersen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86093","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gail Williams","data":{"first_name":"Gail","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017119","middle_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"Williams","source_individual_id":"RMIS28497","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gail Williams"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr William Bor","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006156","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bor","source_individual_id":"RMIS1099638","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr William Bor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78373","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jackob Najman","data":{"first_name":"Jackob","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003590","middle_name":"Moses","last_name":"Najman","source_individual_id":"5016639","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jackob Najman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77655","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3475","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mothers' History of Mental Health Impairment and its Impact during Mid-Life","data":{"media_summary":"WOMEN'S MENTAL HEALTH","end_year":2004,"keywords":["ANXIETY","DEPRESSION","LONGITUDINAL STUDY","MENOPAUSE","WOMEN'S HEALTH"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210297,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["MENTAL ILLNESS","QUALITY OF LIFE","WELL WOMEN","WOMEN'S HEALTH","WOMEN'S MENTAL HEALTH"],"scientific_title":"Mothers' History of Mental Health Impairment and its Impact during Mid-Life","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical and Health Sciences not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Jackob Najman","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210297","simplified_title":"Mothers' History of Mental Health Impairment and its Impact during Mid-Life","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"421580","source_system":"There have been few specific studies of the health of women in mid-life. In mid-life, mental health impairment and health problems associated with biological and social transitions (e.g. menopause) are major concerns. National estimates indicate that between 15% and 20% of women in the mid-life age range have experienced a mental illness in the past year. The proportion of women experiencing a combination of emotional and physical symptoms, frequently associated with the menopause, is likely to be somewhat higher. This proposal involves merging information collected initially from 1981 onwards, with data on the mother's mental and physical health, to be collected in this follow-up. Women in this study (8556) were enrolled at their first obstetrical visit and they have been followed up shortly after the birth, when the child was 6 months, 5 years and 14 years. On each occasion extensive information has been obtained on the mother's mental and physical health, as well as on the child's health and development. This study will examine the chronicity of the mother's mental health symptoms over a 21-year period, and assess the association between her early mental health, the child's health and her current health status. This is the only large Australian cohort study to have followed a sample of women for 21 years. It will permit us to understand more of how women's health changes over time and the factors associated with these changes. It will provide the first large-scale study of factors influencing women's health transition through the menopause."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael O'Callaghan","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044590","middle_name":"James","last_name":"O'Callaghan","source_individual_id":"RMIS1119732","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael O'Callaghan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88543","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Margaret Andersen","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0035089","middle_name":"","last_name":"Andersen","source_individual_id":"RMIS1119737","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Margaret Andersen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86093","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gail Williams","data":{"first_name":"Gail","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0017119","middle_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"Williams","source_individual_id":"RMIS28497","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gail Williams"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr William Bor","data":{"first_name":"William","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006156","middle_name":"","last_name":"Bor","source_individual_id":"RMIS1099638","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr William Bor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78373","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jackob Najman","data":{"first_name":"Jackob","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003590","middle_name":"Moses","last_name":"Najman","source_individual_id":"5016639","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jackob Najman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77655","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3474","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular cell biology of hNP22: role in alcohol dependence","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["drug dependence","gene expression","molecular neuroscience"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210295,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["addiction","alcoholism","brain cell damage"],"scientific_title":"Molecular cell biology of hNP22: role in alcohol dependence","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Peter Wilce","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210295","simplified_title":"A novel gene associated with alcoholism","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"346320","source_system":"We used a differential screening procedure to detect changes in gene expression in the human alcoholic brain and described a novel gene, which we named hNP22, with increased expression in the superior frontal cortex of the alcoholic cases.

What we do not know is which genes are regulated by GH in these processes, and how this will change the state of the cell. We propose here to use the new technique of gene arrays to uncover the programs, or groups of genes, which GH regulates to change important cellular processes. When used in conjunction with cells expressing GH receptor mutants which are unable to signal to defined pathways, we will be able to know which functional families genes are regulated, and how they are regulated. This information will enable us to know how GH regulates cell growth and metabolism, and therfore to understand what goes wrong when GH or its mediator, IGF-1 , are abnormal.

The research has several aims. These are, first, to identify and examine the current practices of child protection and mental health workers where protective concerns have been identified in relation to children whose parent-s have been diagnosed with a mental illness. Practice will be examined at the assessment, child protection follow-up and post-order phases. Second, to identify and examine any barriers to effective collaboration between child protection and mental health organisations; and third, to develop inductively derived descriptions of 'best practice' in relation to these cases. The research will be conducted in four stages, including a survey of child protection and mental health workers, tracking of cases through the child protection system, in-depth interviews with child protection workers, mental health workers and parents, and group discussions with highly experienced child protection and mental health workers. The expected outcomes of the study are: the development of child protection practice guidelines for working with families where children have been harmed or at risk of harm by a parent who has a mental illness, including practice guidelines for interagency collaboration in this field; and identification of supervisional, training, administrative and policy responses to this issue."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Judith Feeney","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0036569","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Feeney","source_individual_id":"RMIS1112030","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Judith Feeney"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86484","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Yvonne Darlington","data":{"first_name":"Yvonne","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0036158","middle_name":"","last_name":"Darlington","source_individual_id":"RMIS1112027","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Yvonne Darlington"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86377","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3470","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Osteoclast- specific gene regulation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Control of gene expression","Macrophage biology","Osteoclast biology","Transcription factor","Transgenic animals"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210261,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Arthritis","Inflammation","Osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Osteoclast- specific gene regulation","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Dr Alan Cassady","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210261","simplified_title":"Bone cell regulation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"226650","source_system":"Osteoporosis is a pathological loss of bone that affects many Australians.

It occurs in all organs of the developing body. In the nervous system about 50% of all neurons die at a time when they are making contact with one another or with their target organs. The underlying mechanisms that drive programmed neuronal cell death are not known. One possibility is that the formation of neuronal contacts (synapses) with other neurons and target cells determines the fate of a neuron. The connections of motor neurons with muscle during this period of developmental neuronal cell death is the best model to examine this phenomenon. In this grant we are in an exciting position to be able to address what causes neuronal cell death, as we have a number of mice that lack key molecules needed for the formation of specializations that allow neuronal contacts to be made between motor neurons and their muscle, and with other neurons within the spinal cord. By examining the function of motor neurons, counting them and screening for molecular changes in these mice, we will be able to dissect out the mechanism of how a motor neurons' fate is determined during the period of programmed cell death. The outcomes of this research will enable us to understand how the nervous system is shaped during development and will increase our knowledge about the basis of adult neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the pathology of Alzheimer's is characterised by a breakdown in neuronal connections that ultimately result in neuronal death and a loss of thought processes (cognition)."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Noakes","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038807","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Noakes","source_individual_id":"5016732","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Noakes"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87053","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Mark Bellingham","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0035336","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Bellingham","source_individual_id":"5013441","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Mark Bellingham"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86159","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3468","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Anatomical substrates for primate executive cortical function","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["central nervous system","cognition","primates"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210250,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Alzheimers disease","Schizophrenia","dementia"],"scientific_title":"Anatomical substrates for primate executive cortical function","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Guy Elston","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210250","simplified_title":"The mind - brain connection: a closeup look at circuits","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"362820","source_system":"When studying the brain, many have been tempted to look for similarities in organization of cells and circuitry in different regions involved in various processes. While, at a first approximation, this may be a reasonable approach to understand how the brain works, it also ignores what makes the brain so complex: the diversity in its structure. In the late 19th, and early 20th, centuries, pioneering anatomists seized on the diversity in structure of the human brain. The study of cortical circuitry that underlies the diversity in cortical processing reached a zenith and there was a renaissance in understanding of brain function. These researchers were, however, limited by techniques available to them at the time. With the advent of new methodologies which allowed scientists to explore individual connections between cells (synapses), to probe structure and transmission across synapses, and to record from live neurones, new and exciting discoveries were made. However, these methodologies are highly time consuming and studies became necessarily more focussed. As a result, there was a tendency in the later half of the 20th century to extrapolate findings from one cortical area to cortex in general. Even more precarious, anatomical and functional findings in highly specialized sensory cortex of one species were projected to other distantly related species. Such thinking lead to a dark age in neuroscience. It became widely accepted that there exists a canonical circuit. Consequently, differences in function between different cortical areas were attributed solely to the source of their projections. The central thesis of this project is to study aspects of cell structure and cortical circuitry in the prefrontal lobe. We hope that the project will provide another step in the pathway that leads to understanding the mind."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Guy Elston","data":{"first_name":"Guy","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0042265","middle_name":"","last_name":"Elston","source_individual_id":"RMIS224199","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Guy Elston"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87969","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3467","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Induction of antigen-specific tolerance through inhibition of RelB function in dendritic cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["RelB","arthritis","dendritic cells","immunotherapy","regulation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210237,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Autoimmunity","Immunotherapy","Rheumatoid arthritis"],"scientific_title":"Induction of antigen-specific tolerance through inhibition of RelB function in dendritic cells","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ranjeny Thomas","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210237","simplified_title":"Re-education of the immune system in autoimmune arthritis","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"421980","source_system":"This proposal builds on preliminary data showing the possibility that responses of the immune system to antigens can be suppressed by modifying cells known as dendritic cells using an inhibitory drug.

The experiments to be undertaken specifically look at means to prevent and reverse diseases like rheumatoid arthritis through the use of dendritic cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Ranjeny Thomas","data":{"first_name":"Ranjeny","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0045826","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thomas","source_individual_id":"RMIS4352","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Ranjeny Thomas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88853","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Brendan O'Sullivan","data":{"first_name":"Brendan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015384","middle_name":"John","last_name":"O'Sullivan","source_individual_id":"RMIS1088861","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Brendan O'Sullivan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80879","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3466","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effects of hypoxia and reactive oxygen species on neuronal excitability of intrinsic cardiac ganglia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Cardiovascular control","Electrophysiology","Intracardiac ganglia","Intracellular calcium","Ion channels"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210233,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Cardiac arrhythmias","Cardiac ischaemia","Coronary heart disease","Ischaemia-reperfusion"],"scientific_title":"Effects of hypoxia and reactive oxygen species on neuronal excitability of intrinsic cardiac ganglia","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Adams","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210233","simplified_title":"Hypoxia and neural control of the heart","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"70000","source_system":"Neural control of the heart is mediated by intrinsic cardiac neurones which respond to chemical substances such as neurotransmitters released from nerve fibres innervating the heart and vasoactive substances released into the coronary ciruculation.

The involvement of membrane electrical phenomena in general, and ion-selective pores (ion channels) in particular, and the action of hypoxia and oxygen-derived free readicals on their function will be studied in isolated neurones dissociated from neonatal and adult rat intrinsic cardiac ganglia. The characterization of ion channels modulated by hypoxia and reactive oxygen species will be monitored using electrical and fluorescence techniques. The opening of ion channels in the cell membrane by changes in either voltage or the intracellular calcium ion concentration leads to an electrical response. The goal of the research is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of ischaemia and ischaemia-reperfusion on neuronal excitability in mammalian cardiac ganglia, thus regulation of the heart rate.

The assessment of contraction in each region of the heart is probably the most important of the reasons for doing this test, as regional function is disturbed in patients with coronary artery disease, which is one of the most common causes of death in Australia. The problem is that this analysis is currently completely subjective, and the reliability of the tool is based upon the availability of an experienced observer. This is particularly a problem in rural Australia, as most specialists with expertise in this modality work in the capital cities, and especially a problem in Queensland, where fewer than half of the population live in the capital. The cardiac imaging group at the University of Queensland have been working in collaboration with GE-Vingmed Ultrasound to develop a quantitative technique for the assessment of regional cardiac function since 1997. This collaboration has been the source of a number of published papers and presentations at international meetings. Our group is considered to be a world leader in the field and our industry partner is clearly the most focused of its competitors in addressing this problem. This submission seeks to address several remaining problems. The data thus far addressed function during stress, when the condition of most patients is similar. Tissue velocities are more variable at rest, and a more sophisticated approach is required to accurately measure the lower velocities in the resting state. This research plan seeks support for the development of a new, high frame-rate acquisition that would facilitate the examination of velocities relative to each other, so that translational motion of the heart does not influence the reading. This new method would then be validated against other techniques for assessing function and disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kjell Kristoffersen","data":{"first_name":"Kjell","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0043611","middle_name":"","last_name":"Kristoffersen","source_individual_id":"RMIS1148776","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Kjell Kristoffersen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88307","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Thomas Marwick","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032377","middle_name":"Hugh","last_name":"Marwick","source_individual_id":"RMIS108223","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Thomas Marwick"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85383","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr Gunnar Hansen","data":{"first_name":"Gunnar","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013494","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hansen","source_individual_id":"RMIS1148779","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Mr Gunnar Hansen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80346","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephen Rose","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009965","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Rose","source_individual_id":"5017273","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephen Rose"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79404","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bjorn Olstad","data":{"first_name":"Bjorn","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0003783","middle_name":"","last_name":"Olstad","source_individual_id":"RMIS1148773","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Bjorn Olstad"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77719","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3462","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Importance of the transmural distribution of viable myocardium to outcome of patients after revascularization","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Echocardiography","Exercise test","Thalium SPECT","Ventricular dysfunction - Left","Viable myocardium"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210217,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Echocardiography","Heart failure","Ventricular dysfunction - Left","Viable myocardium"],"scientific_title":"Importance of the transmural distribution of viable myocardium to outcome of patients after revascularization","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.

Because these procedures may be risky in cardiac patients, the investigators have used various imaging approaches including radionuclide and ultrasound techniques to predict regions where function will recover after intervention. The results of these tests may be discordant because they assess separate attributes of cardiac muscle, and selection of patients for intervention on the basis of recovery of regional function ignores some other aspects that may be important. These include avoidance of heart enlargement, improvement of exercise capacity, and avoidance of heart rhythm disturbances and even other heart attacks. In this study, the investigators seek to define the importance of the proportion and site of live (viable) myocardium to the parameters listed above. A new magnetic resonance technique will be used to identify whether radionuclide and ultrasound techniques assess different parts of the heart wall. The relative importance of these sites will be identified by comparing the outcome of patients who have live tissue in the inner half, compared with the outer half of the heart wall. This study will involve 180 patients who will undergo testing with magnetic resonance and radionuclide imaging. A subgroup will undergo dobutamine echocardiography.

We have identified a reaction catalysed by these enzymes that generates a chemical found in the brain normally, whose levels are elevated under stress and which, when given to animals, is anxiogenic. This points to a possible involvement of P450 enzymes in a hitherto unexplored branch of the stress response. Importantly, it may lead to the development of novel drugs that block the P450 and therefore block production of the anxiogenic chemical.

Using the mouse as an experimental model it will investigate the importance of several factors in the changes which set up the placenta and fetus as seperate tissues in the very early embryo. A key focus is the supply of glucose to the newly fertilised embryo and how important this glucose supply is for the survival of the embryo. Moreover there is great interest in the possibility that metabolic events in utero can contribute to the development of diseases in later life, notably, coronary heart diease, stroke, high blood pressure and non-insulin dependent diabetes. The results from these studies will contribute to our understanding of why some couples are infertile, lead to improved management of infertility by diet and invitro fertilisation procedures. It will also be of benefit in dietary advice to women with diabetes mellitus, seeking to have children.

Hearing loss can lead to social isolation and depression and has a profound effect on quality of life. Hearing aids are often seen as the panacea for hearing loss in older people but approximately 35% of people who have obtained a hearing aid use it infrequently or not at all. Even those who do use the hearing aid frequently may still have difficulty hearing in everyday situations. In addition, there are many older people with a hearing impairment who do not want a hearing aid. Cost is often cited as a factor but reasons such as cosmetic appearance and attitude towards hearing loss are also major reasons for not using hearing aids. Hearing is just one element of successful communication. The ability to communicate despite the presence of a hearing impairment is the focus of a new intervention, the Active Communication Education (ACE) program. Participants develop problem-solving strategies to help with communication in everyday life. The program uses a positive approach aimed at enabling older people themselves to try new solutions to old problems. The aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of ACE for a range of older people with hearing impairment: those who are already using hearing aids, and those who have not sought a hearing aid. Some of the questions answered in this study are: Does the ACE program improve communication and quality of life for older people with hearing impairment? Do some people respond better to ACE , and if so, why? Are there long term effects of ACE?

They can also be modified by chemicals which occur naturally in the body. Two of the most important naturally occurring chemicals which affect the function of the heart are (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline. These chemicals and others which have been synthesized and optimized can also be used therapeutically. They work by activating proteins which occur on the cell surface, called b-adrenoceptors. When activated, b-adrenoceptors cause an increase in the force of each heart beat and a reduction in the duration of each heart beat. This may be an advantage in conditions where the heart beat is too long. In this study we propose to map the biochemical pathways through which b-adrenoceptors affect each heart beat. The therapeutic management of heart failure has been revolutionized by the use of compounds which block b-adrenoceptors. One such drug, carvedilol is currently used in this country. The way in which it works may not be fully understood. In preliminary experiments we have identified a novel mechanism for carvedilol directly in human heart in which it may work and contribute to it's beneficial effects in the management of heart failure.

The aim of this project is to accurately define the best way to dose these newer immunosuppressant drugs in Australian populations, before they become more widely used ."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Pillans","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044840","middle_name":"I","last_name":"Pillans","source_individual_id":"RMIS3112671","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Pillans"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88604","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Susan Tett","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040037","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Tett","source_individual_id":"5011655","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Susan Tett"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87372","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Duffull","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036379","middle_name":"B","last_name":"Duffull","source_individual_id":"5014415","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Duffull"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86429","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr Paul Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Mr","dw_individual_id":"DW0022474","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"5017860","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Mr Paul Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82790","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Lynch","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014580","middle_name":"V","last_name":"Lynch","source_individual_id":"RMIS5846","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Lynch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80640","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3455","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Urotensin-II in human heart: investigation of mechanisms involved in cardiac function","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Pharmacology","Urotensin-II","cardiac contraction","cardiac failure","signalling pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210172,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cardiomyopathy","cardiovascular disease","pharmacological intervention"],"scientific_title":"Urotensin-II in human heart: investigation of mechanisms involved in cardiac function","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Fraser Russell","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210172","simplified_title":"Urotensin-II: its role in human heart","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"255990","source_system":"The normal function of the body is maintained by naturally occurring compounds. Some for example affect the heart, fine tuning it to make it beat faster or slower, or beat with greater or less force when required in different situations in health and disease. We were the first to show just recently that a small protein which occurs naturally in the body, called urotensin-II can affect the way the heart beats. We showed that extremely tiny amounts increase the force of the heart beat. Our findings indicate that urotensin-II is the most potent heart stimulator identified to date. In patients with heart failure, short term stimulation of heart contraction is beneficial, supplying the heart and other organs with vital oxygen and nutrients. However, in the long term excessive stimulation causes worsening of the patients condition. Very little is currently known about the way in which urotensin-II alters heart function. The goal of our study is to understand the mechanism involved in urotensin-II mediated effects on the heart. This will involve identifying the location of urotensin-II and its receptors in the heart, and determining what signalling changes occur after the interaction of urotensin-II with its receptors. Urotensin-II must first be cleaved from a larger drug. We will determine where in the heart this cleavage occurs and whether the process is crucial to the ability of urotensin-II to stimulate contraction of the heart. Since stimulators of heart contraction are detrimental to patients with heart failure in the long term, we will determine whether these patients have more urotensin-II in their blood than patients who do not have heart failure. If the levels of urotensin-II are higher in heart failure patients, it may indicate a need to interfere with the interaction of urotensin-II with its receptors."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Fraser Russell","data":{"first_name":"Fraser","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0045208","middle_name":"Donald","last_name":"Russell","source_individual_id":"RMIS1114929","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Fraser Russell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88699","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3454","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of plasma membrane microdomains in regulating Ras-dependent Raf activation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Lipid Rafts","Plasma membrane microdomains","Raf-1 activation","Ras signalling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210164,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Acute leukaemia","Cancer biology","Colon cancer"],"scientific_title":"The role of plasma membrane microdomains in regulating Ras-dependent Raf activation","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof John Hancock","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210164","simplified_title":"Interactions between Ras proteins and the cell membrane","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"216100","source_system":"In human cancers one or more of the signaling pathways leading from growth factor receptors at the cell surface to the nucleus where cell division is initiated are subverted. For example, a protein called Ras, that regulates a series of major signaling pathways, is mutated in 25% of all human tumours. This leaves Ras and the signaling pathways permanently switched on causing uncontrolled cell proliferation. Our previous work has demonstrated that Ras must be attached to the inner surface of the cell membrane in order to function properly. This project now seeks to understand exactly how Ras attaches to and interacts with specific sites in the plasma membrane. Its is becoming clear that different isoforms of Ras, called H-, N- and K-ras have different functions in the cell which may in turn result from their different sites of attachment to the cell membrane. This is important because by understanding the precise micro-environment in which the different Ras proteins operate and how they activate subsequent proteins in their signaling networks we will be in a good position to design drugs that selectively compromise the function of each specific Ras isoform. A highly relevant example is provided by K-ras which is mutated in 90% of all pancreatic cancers and 50% of all colon cancers. Clearly the clinical impact of a drug that could selectively neutralise K-Ras function in these tumours is potentially enormous."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Hancock","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037089","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Hancock","source_individual_id":"RMIS11500","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Hancock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86600","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3451","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"BRCA1, PML and telomere maintenance","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Acute promyelocytic leukaemia gene PML","Breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1","Chromosome stability","Molecular biology of cancer","Telomeres"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210162,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Breast cancer","Genetic predisposition to cancer","Tumour suppressor genes","Tumourigenesis"],"scientific_title":"BRCA1, PML and telomere maintenance","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetics not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Melissa Brown","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210162","simplified_title":"Understanding how abnormalities in chromosome ends contribute to breast cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"226320","source_system":"Breast cancer affects approximately one in ten women and is therefore a major health problem.

Why this is so is unknown. Iron is normally absorbed from the diet by with the help of special molecules in the small intestine, carried in the blood to the liver where it is used by the cells. We would like to study how the proteins that transport iron in the intestine function and see if this is a different in disease. We would also like to examine exactly which molecules are important in depositing iron in the liver in patients with cirrhosis. We will work on animal models of liver disease as well as humans. We will treat animals so that they have liver disease that resembles human subjects with cirrhosis. These treatments include (1) feeding the animals carbon-tetrachloride, a toxin which damages the liver cells and therefore causes hepatocellular liver injury, and (2) tying the bile duct which stops the flow of bile and this results in cholestatic liver injury. It is known which proteins takes iron into the normal liver cells but no one knows which molecules transport the iron in liver disease. We think they may be different, because when the liver becomes diseased, scarring occurs this results in cirrhosis. Molecules that could easily enter liver cells may now be too big to pass through the openings. These studies are important since they will suggest new treatments to patients with liver disease who are awaiting a liver transplant and the treatment will probably differ depending on which type of liver disease the patient has."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Roberts","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039362","middle_name":"Stephen","last_name":"Roberts","source_individual_id":"RMIS41002","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Roberts"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87206","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"E/Pr Lawrie Powell","data":{"first_name":"Lawrie","title":"E/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039158","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Powell","source_individual_id":"5012157","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"E/Pr Lawrie Powell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87152","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Linda Fletcher","data":{"first_name":"Linda","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013042","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Fletcher","source_individual_id":"5014660","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Linda Fletcher"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80225","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Darrell Crawford","data":{"first_name":"Darrell","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006770","middle_name":"Henry Gordon","last_name":"Crawford","source_individual_id":"5012156","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Darrell Crawford"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78535","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3449","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Extracellular acidosis and pH-modulating drugs as novel therapies for neuroprotection in hypoxia/ischemia in the newborn","data":{"media_summary":"neonatal brain injury","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Asphyxia","Perinatal asphyxia","hypoxia-ischaemia-reperfusion injury to the developing brain","neuropharmacology","neuroprotection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210156,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["birth asphyxia","brain asphyxia","hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy","infant, newborn","neonatal brain injury"],"scientific_title":"Extracellular acidosis and pH-modulating drugs as novel therapies for neuroprotection in hypoxia/ischemia in the newborn","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Paediatrics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Colditz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210156","simplified_title":"Low pH protects nerve cells from a lack of oxygen in the newborn","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"452310","source_system":"Approximately 4 out of every 1000 babies suffer severe perinatal asphyxia (a period of a shortage of oxygen) during the birth process which carries with it a high risk of brain damage or death.

The interferons comprise an elaborate system of natural substances produced in the body, one of whose functions is to prevent cancer cells from developing. The interferons have been widely used to treat human diseases including viral infections and cancers caused by the wart virus. However, results of recent work indicates that viruses like the wart virus, HPV, have developed ways of inhibiting its effectiveness. We have found that cervical carcinoma cells and virally infected cells resist the direct anti-cancer and anti-viral effects of interferons because they have abnormalities in their ability to respond to interferon. We have made good progress in understanding why these cells do not respond to the interferons. In particular they show a deficiency in the activity of cell proteins required to transmit the interferon signal inside the cells. The current proposal will allow us to gain a greater understanding of the processes inside cells that are taken over by the wart viral proteins and the reasons for its abnormality in interferon resistant cancer cells. We will determine whether the levels of certain genes in clinical samples from patients relates to their response to interferon treatment. This may allow us to establish a test to predict which patients will respond to interferon therapy, saving patients from ineffective treatment, side effects and cost. This study will have a broad significance to many human diseases where abnormalities in interferon signaling occur and will help to bring about the necessary changes in cell properties to overcome the abnormalities, restore the responses and improve the application of interferons to treat infectious diseases and perhaps other cancers as well."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephen Ralph","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0044982","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Ralph","source_individual_id":"RMIS2453271","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephen Ralph"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88646","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nigel Mcmillan","data":{"first_name":"Nigel","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0032535","middle_name":"Alan John","last_name":"Mcmillan","source_individual_id":"5016394","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Nigel Mcmillan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85423","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Laimonis Laimins","data":{"first_name":"Laimonis","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020238","middle_name":"A.","last_name":"Laimins","source_individual_id":"RMIS442280","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Laimonis Laimins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82168","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr David Jardine","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0013909","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jardine","source_individual_id":"RMIS1094804","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr David Jardine"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80452","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3447","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effective immunotherapy for HPV associated cervical cancer precursor lesions","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Epithelial immunology","Immunotherapy","Papillomavirus","Viral Immunology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210148,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Cervical cancer prevention","Cervical cancer treatment","Tumour immunology"],"scientific_title":"Effective immunotherapy for HPV associated cervical cancer precursor lesions","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Ian Frazer","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210148","simplified_title":"Treating abnormal PAP smears immunologically","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"482640","source_system":"Vaccines to prevent cervical cancer are currently being developed.

The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to identify important interactions as they occur, rather than attempting to decipher them after they have occurred. An analogy would be watching a football game live and observing how goals were scored and appreciating the performance of individual players versus trying to guess from the final score how the game was played and who the key performers were.

Hepatic fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis and liver transplantation may be required for patients with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The chronic liver injury may result from a number of causes including alcohol, persistent viral infections and metabolic disorders. The mechanisms causing fibrosis in liver are similar to those causing fibrosis in other organs such as kidney and heart. In those organs, the renin-angiotensin system has been shown to contribute to the progression of fibrosis. This system has not been investigated in hepatic fibrosis. We have recently shown in patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV), that those patients who are genetically pre-disposed to produce higher levels of angiotensin have more liver fibrosis. This application will investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in hepatic fibrosis and whether using currently available drugs to inhibit this system can decrease the rate of progression of fibrosis in liver. Liver failure due to chronic HCV infection is currently the leading indication for liver transplantation in Australia. For those patients who fail to respond to anti-viral therapy, there are currently no approved therapeutic options designed to delay or reverse the progression of fibrosis. Based on current known numbers of HCV patients it has been estimated that by the year 2020, over 2000 HCV patients will require a liver transplant each year in Queensland alone. Currently the number of donor livers available allows about 50 transplants per year. Thus there is a desperate need for therapeutic treatments that will delay or reverse the progression of hepatic fibrosis. A successful conclusion to this study will provide a clinically useful treatment strategy that can delay the progression of hepatic fibrosis and thus prevent the need for liver transplantation in many patients."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Powell","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044903","middle_name":"Ellen","last_name":"Powell","source_individual_id":"RMIS13575","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Powell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88622","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Clouston","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030002","middle_name":"Donald","last_name":"Clouston","source_individual_id":"RMIS228640","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Clouston"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84776","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Julie Jonsson","data":{"first_name":"Julie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002506","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Jonsson","source_individual_id":"5015557","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Julie Jonsson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77348","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3442","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular Characterization of SV40 infection","data":{"media_summary":"viral-induced cancer/oncogenesis","end_year":2002,"keywords":["cell biology","endoplasmic reticulum","membrane transport","plasma membrane","virus entry and replication"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210101,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cancer","gene therapy","viral infection","viral replication","viral-induced cancer/oncogenesis"],"scientific_title":"Molecular Characterization of SV40 infection","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Robert Parton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210101","simplified_title":"How viruses enter cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"75440","source_system":"Viral disease is a major health hazard in the modern world. SV40 is a relatively simple virus which must enter mammalian cells in order to replicate. As it does so, it causes the infected cell to divide and hence triggers tumour formation in the host. This proposal is aimed at understanding how SV40 enters cells, and then passes to the nucleus where it replicates. Most viruses have hijacked existing pathways into cells. For example, some viruses have used the pathway by which cells take up nutrients from the external medium. However, we have shown that SV40 uses a completely novel pathway involving surface pits called caveolae. The subsequent steps in the pathway are unknown and have been difficult to study. We have discovered a number of agents which inhibit infection by SV40. In this proposal we will characterise the infectious entry pathway by investigating exactly where in the cell these agents work. We will then isolate the virus from within the cell and attempt to reconstitute part of the viral entry pathway in vitro. These studies will provide insights into the entry pathway of the virus which may lead to new therapeutic strategies to combat viral disease. In addition, study of this pathway, leading from the cell surface to the nucleus, may provide new avenues for drug delivery and-or gene targetting."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Parton","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027233","middle_name":"Glenn","last_name":"Parton","source_individual_id":"5016875","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Parton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84038","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3441","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional Characterization of Caveolae and Caveolins","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["cell biology","cholesterol","development","membrane signaling","membrane transport"],"nhmrc_grant_id":210100,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["cancer","defects in embryonic development","lipid disorder","lysosomal Storage Diseases"],"scientific_title":"Functional Characterization of Caveolae and Caveolins","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Robert Parton","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/210100","simplified_title":"Cell signalling through lipid domains","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"140660","source_system":"This project aims to study the cellular machinery that allows a cell to respond to its external environment. Specifically, this project focusses on the function of a family of membrane proteins, called caveolins, which are the major protein components of caveolae small pits which cover the surface of many mammalian cells. Caveolins are believed to regulate signalling from the external environment to the cell interior and loss of this regulation leads to uncontrolled growth leading to cancer. Signalling from the cell surface relies on organisation of signalling components into modules. Our studies suggest that these modules are dependent on specific lipid molecules which form discrete patches, called lipid rafts, on the cell surface. We have hypothesised that caveolins control the lipid molecules associated with lipid rafts and so, indirectly, control signalling pathways. In particular, we have shown that caveolin is important in the regulation of cellular cholesterol, a vital molecule involved in maintaining the function of lipid raft domains. As numerous human diseases are associated with cholesterol imbalance, studies of caveolins can give fundamental new insights into this process, and the previously unidentified links between the cellular lipid balance and signal transduction. This project aims to use mutant caveolin molecules to disrupt caveolin function and so determine the role of caveolin in lipid regulation and in signal transduction. We will then use a lower vertebrate model system, which is amenable to experimental manipulation, to determine the role of caveolins and rafts in the development of the whole embryo."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Parton","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027233","middle_name":"Glenn","last_name":"Parton","source_individual_id":"5016875","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Robert Parton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84038","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3440","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structural characterisation and pharmacology of ion channel toxins from spider venoms.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["ion channels","mass spectrometry","molecular pharmacology","protein biochemistry","spider toxins"],"nhmrc_grant_id":194470,"application_year":2001,"start_year":2002,"scientific_title":"Structural characterisation and pharmacology of ion channel toxins from spider venoms.","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Basic Pharmacology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Lachlan Rash","higher_grant_type":"Early Career Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194470","simplified_title":"Structural characterisation and pharmacology of ion channel toxins from spider venoms.","sub_type":"INSERM Exchange ECF","total_budget":"223206.8","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Lachlan Rash","data":{"first_name":"Lachlan","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0027509","middle_name":"D","last_name":"Rash","source_individual_id":"RMIS1373336","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Lachlan Rash"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84101","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3184","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Body Mass Index and Mortality in Aboriginal Australians in Northern Territory: A Cohort Study","data":{"media_summary":"weight disorders","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Aboriginal","Mortality","cardiovascular risk","nutrition","obesity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":193316,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Aboriginal health","body weight changes","epidemiology","health status","weight disorders"],"scientific_title":"Body Mass Index and Mortality in Aboriginal Australians in Northern Territory: A Cohort Study","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Zhiqiang Wang","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/193316","simplified_title":"Body Mass Index and Mortality in Aboriginal Australians","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"136220","source_system":"The ultimate goal of this study is to define a healthy weight range for Aboriginal people.

We know that there is a special class of neurons, the direction-selective ganglion cells, which are able to detect the direction of image motion.

Fellowship","total_budget":"168958.36","source_system":"The overall aim of this series of experiments is to understand how the spine is controlled and how this changes in disease. Altered control has been identified in people with low back pain, yet we still know very little about the normal mechanisms for protection and support of the spine. Back pain is a common affliction that affects about 5% of Australians each year and is the most common and expensive work-related injury in western society. An understanding of normal control and the mechanism of dysfunction is critical for identification of risk factors and development of strategies for rehabilitation and prevention. The experiments are divided into two series. The first series addresses normal spinal control. The questions to be asked deal with how the brain copes with the challenge of using trunk muscles for breathing and spinal control at the same time, how the activity of the trunk muscles is affected by input from sensory receptors in the joints, ligaments and muscles of the spine, and whether intra-abdominal pressure can support the trunk. The second series deals with clinical populations. The first aim is to identify whether people with respiratory diseases use trunk muscles for spinal control and breathing at the same time. If they cannot, we predict that they will be more prone to low back pain. We will test this in a large study of incidence of low back pain in people with and without respiratory disease. The second study will investigate the pelvic floor muscles which are important for continence and assist with spinal control. We will investigate whether people with incontinence have poor spinal control and whether this leads to back pain. The final experiment will identify whether people with low back pain interpret sensory information from the spine differently. By answering these questions we hope to intervene in the enormous personal, social and economic consequences of LBP which affects between 60-90% of the population at some stage in their life."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Paul Hodges","data":{"first_name":"Paul","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043077","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Hodges","source_individual_id":"RMIS222953","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Paul Hodges"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88164","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Lord","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038138","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lord","source_individual_id":"RMIS5224","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Lord"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86883","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2713","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular mechanisms linking proteinuria and sodium retention","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["megalin","proteinuria","proximal tubule","sodium -hydrogen exchange"],"nhmrc_grant_id":153931,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["hypertension","progressive renal disease","proteinuria"],"scientific_title":"Molecular mechanisms linking proteinuria and sodium retention","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Nephrology and Urology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Philip Poronnik","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/153931","simplified_title":"Control of protein and sodium handling in the kidney","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"211527.54","source_system":"The clinical association between protein loss in the urine and retention of salt, resulting in high blood pressure and progressive decline in kidney function, is well known. Under normal conditions, the kidneys filter 180 litres of water and reabsorb 1.7 kg of salt per day, a function which is principally performed by the kidney tubules in the kidney. Similarly the kidney tubule cells reabsorb and break down up to 3 grams of albumin per day. In the past, it has been considered that excessive protein loss in the urine is primarily due to problems in the filtering units of the kidneys, rather than due to abnormalities in the reabsorption of protein in the kidney tubules. However, we consider that common abnormalities in the processes within the kidney tubules that regulate both the reabsorption of salt and the excretion of acid may result in concomitant high blood pressure and increased protein loss in the kidney. Thus the overall aim of the project is to investigate the interrelationship between protein reabsorption and catabolism and Na+ reabsorption in the human kidney tubule. The project uses the combined methods of cultured human kidney tubules, biochemical and molecular biology techniques which are unavailable in other laboratories in Australia (and internationally). This project will comprehensively characterise the mechanisms of protein uptake and salt reabsorption in human kidney tubule cells when exposed to both normal and high concentrations of protein. The exact nature of the interaction of protein uptake with salt reabsorption and hence high blood pressure will be determined. As both hypertension and persistent proteinuria are the most important predictors of tubulointerstitial pathology and progressive decline in renal function in almost all renal disease, the understanding of the precise interaction between these two factors is essential in the design of renoprotective therapies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Carol

This gene is very closely related to another gene, Sox9, that is known to be a critical factor in determining whether an embryo develops as a male or female by specifying whether the embryo makes testes or ovaries. We have found that Sox8, like Sox9, is active in the cell type in fetal testes known to be important for the development of maleness, at around the time when the male-female decision is being made. We therefore believe that Sox8 is an important part of the genetic chain of events leading to normal male development. We aim to study how Sox8 exerts its effects on male development. We have also found that in humans, Sox8 is located in a chromosomal region associated with a developmental disease syndrome characterized by mental retardation, facial defects and anomalies of male sexual development. Sox8 is active in mouse embryos in all the tissues affected by the human disease. We believe defects in SOX8 in humans are largely responsible for this disease, called ATR-16 syndrome. We will test whether patients with ATR-16 have defects involving SOX8 in their DNA in order to test this theory. In summary, we believe we have found a new human disease gene which will further our understanding of how developmental diseases arise in the embryo. In addition, this work will shed light on the process of sexual development, a significant healthcare problem in view of the fact that defects in sexual development are among the most common forms of birth defects."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Koopman","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043570","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Koopman","source_individual_id":"5015773","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Koopman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88298","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2331","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional characterisation of Pendrin: the anion transporter causing Pendred Syndrome","data":{"media_summary":"thyroid goitre","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Functional characterisation","Membrane physiology","anion transport","molecular biology","mutation analyses"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143096,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Pendred Syndrome","congenital deafness","hearing loss","ion transport defect","thyroid goitre"],"scientific_title":"Functional characterisation of Pendrin: the anion transporter causing Pendred Syndrome","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Physiology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Daniel Markovich","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143096","simplified_title":"Characterisation of the protein responsible for Pendred Syndrome","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"211527.54","source_system":"Mutations in the human pendrin protein cause progressive hearing loss from an early age in Pendred syndrome.

Sulphate in the body is essential for cell matrix formation and cartilage-bone development and growth. Trafficking defects in these proteins can lead to changes in serum sulphate levels, which results in softening of the bones, insufficient cartilage development, and changes in many metabolic processes.

The disease usually affects people above the age of 75-80. With an ageing population, reaching 3.5 million (over 65) in Australia by year of 2020, AMD is quickly becoming a significant socio-economic problem. Gene therapy could be a cure for the above disease. Currently, there are large numbers of antisense oligonucleotides that have the potential to be developed as new medicines. However, a lack of absorption-cellular uptake and poor in vivo stability are major hurdles that must first be overcome, before any of these compounds will reach the clinic. Synthetic DNA delivery agents are of interest for gene therapy as an alternative to viral vectors, since they carry potentially fewer risks in terms of immuneresponse and propagation. Gene transfer with synthetic compounds is a growing field of research and the largest family of such agents is based on positively charged lipids which are able to self-associate and to form complexes (salts) with DNA conferring a compacted state on the plasmid. Our project will address these major issues through a highly novel strategy involving ion pair formation of lipophilic dendrimer (tree-like compounds with positive charges on the surface) constructs. This multidisciplinary approach has the potential to develop and test new DNA-dendrimer complexes and test them in a well established animal model for neovascularisation. Successful completion of this project might offer a potential therapy for choroidal neovascularisation, with a good chance of entering into human clinical trials by year 2004."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elizabeth Rakoczy","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044981","middle_name":"Piroska","last_name":"Rakoczy","source_individual_id":"5020121","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Elizabeth Rakoczy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88645","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Istvan Toth","data":{"first_name":"Istvan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034329","middle_name":"","last_name":"Toth","source_individual_id":"RMIS17214","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Istvan Toth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85883","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2328","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Conditional knockout of the murine patched gene for the study of skin differentiation and cancer.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["genetics of skin cancer","molecular genetics of human disease","mouse models"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143073,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["basal cell carcinoma","developmental anomalies","medulloblastoma"],"scientific_title":"Conditional knockout of the murine patched gene for the study of skin differentiation and cancer.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Brandon Wainwright","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143073","simplified_title":"A mouse model for skin cancer.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"423564.26","source_system":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer in Australia.

The models will now be used to analyse the effector mechanisms that lead to clearance of the yeast from the oral cavity, with a particular focus on the role of phagocytic cells, and their interaction with T cells. The acute model will be used to identify immunological variables that can act as markers of protection, and the effectiveness of therapeutic manipulations will be evaluated in the chronic model, with the ultimate aim of developing a protective vaccine for human infections."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Robert Ashman","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0029217","middle_name":"Brian","last_name":"Ashman","source_individual_id":"5013239","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Robert Ashman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84574","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Clancy","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0024135","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Clancy","source_individual_id":"RMIS106413","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Clancy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83195","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2325","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cell type specification in developing CNS: functional analysis of Sox14","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["CNS development","CNS function","Developmental genetics","Gene targeting","Neurological disease"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143064,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Motor control","Neurodegeneration","Neurological disease"],"scientific_title":"Cell type specification in developing CNS: functional analysis of Sox14","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurogenetics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof Peter Koopman","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143064","simplified_title":"CNS Cell type specification by Sox14","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"468055.08","source_system":"The central nervous system (CNS) is the most complex organ in the body. The vast majority of nerve cells in the CNS are classified as 'interneurons'. These cells relay sensory information and motor commands within the CNS. Abnormal functioning of interneurons is likely to be the underlying cause of some, if not many, human nervous system diseases. However, very little is known of the precise anatomy and function of interneurons, which genes control their development, and how these functions are maintained in the adult. This has been largely due to a lack of efficient and reliable methods to identify and study interneurons. We have previously discovered that a gene termed Sox14 is active in distinct interneuron groups in the embryonic brain and spinal cord. Sox14 is a member of the Sox gene family, many of which act as genetic switches to control cell and tissue development. We found that Sox14 has been extremely well conserved throughout evolution and is active in similar interneuron groups in a number of animal species. These studies led us to hypothesise that Sox14 controls a critical molecular step in the generation of certain interneurons that may be involved in reflexes, locomotion or motor coordination. In this project, we will investigate both the role of Sox14 in interneuron development and the functions of interneurons in which this gene is active. We will do so by combining modern molecular and genetic techniques with physiological approaches. This project will reveal critical molecular steps in CNS development and determine the functions of a specific group of interneurons. To this end, we will generate mouse strains in which a specific group of interneurons are genetically marked and can be manipulated during development. We envisage that these mice with 'modified brain circuits' will become unique resources for future investigations of selected interneuron types and their functions."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Koopman","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043570","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Koopman","source_individual_id":"5015773","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Koopman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88298","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Toshiya Yamada","data":{"first_name":"Toshiya","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0017254","middle_name":"","last_name":"Yamada","source_individual_id":"RMIS133491","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Toshiya Yamada"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81394","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2324","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Transcriptional control of blood vessel development by Sox18","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Developmental biology","Endothelial cells","Molecular genetics","Sox genes","Transcription factors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143061,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Angiogenesis","Vascular disease","Wound healing"],"scientific_title":"Transcriptional control of blood vessel development by Sox18","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

Improper development of blood vessels in the embryo can compromise survival of the embryo, and defects in the ability of blood vessels to grow, regenerate and adapt to change during adult life can be life-threatening. The growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is also an important factor in the ability of solid tumours to grow during the progression of cancer. It is therefore of fundamental importance in the health sciences to gain an understanding of how blood vessels form and regenerate. As a result of our collaborative research efforts, we have discovered a gene, Sox18, that appears to regulate blood vessel development by controlling the formation and-or behaviour of endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels and make them impermeable. Our research so far indicates that MICE WITH DEFECTS IN SOX18 DIE FROM VASCULAR DEFECTS, underlining the importance of this gene. THIS PROJECT IS CONCERNED WITH FINDING OUT HOW SOX18 WORKS - exactly what goes wrong in mice lacking this gene, whether Sox18 can influence endothelial cell behaviour in cell culture, how Sox18 comes to be active in endothelial cells, what genes are switched on by Sox18, and what genes Sox18 co-operates with in its role in endothelial cells. The answers to these questions will not only provide fundamental basic information about how blood vessels development is controlled, but also sow the seeds for possible future therapies in which blood vessel development could be stimulated (eg in wound healing) or suppressed (eg in tumour progression) through pharmaceutical intervention."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Peter Koopman","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043570","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Koopman","source_individual_id":"5015773","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Peter Koopman"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88298","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof George Muscat","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026936","middle_name":"E.O","last_name":"Muscat","source_individual_id":"RMIS5658","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof George Muscat"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83974","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Jane Olsson","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0009454","middle_name":"","last_name":"Olsson","source_individual_id":"RMIS221670","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Jane Olsson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79265","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2323","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Adaptive change and ethanol dependence","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["alcohol dependence","gene expression","glutamate receptors","molecular neuroscience"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143059,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["addiction","alcoholism","drugs of dependence"],"scientific_title":"Adaptive change and ethanol dependence","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Peter Wilce","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143059","simplified_title":"What changes take place in the brain during the development of alcohol dependence","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"361527.54","source_system":"Ethanol abuse, alcoholism and the medical complications of excessive drinking are now major health problems worldwide.

Alcohol dependence can be considered to result from adaptive changes produced by the chronic presence of ethanol in the brain. In this research programme we will learn more about the adaptive changes in the NMDA receptors, the major excitatory receptors in the brain. Current psychopharmacologic management of human alcoholism is limited and suboptimal. We will explore the efficacy of drugs to control behaviours and withdrawal-induced brain cell death. Effective treatment of the syndrome is crucial since withdrawal induces changes, which increases the severity of subsequent withdrawal episodes and its associated brain damage.

They are found in venoms of snakes, bees, lizards, cone snails, etc and act as toxic and digestive agents. PLA2 enzymes are also found in cells and tissues of mammals where they carry out a wide range of digestive, maintenance, immune defence, and cell signalling functions. The human pancreas secretes one form of PLA2 into the gut to aid digestion. Human immune cells (macrophages, thymocytes, spleen leukocytes, platelets) use other forms of PLA2 in the inflammatory immune response to kill infectious foreign agents like viruses and bacteria. One form of PLA2, known as type IIa, is the main bacteria-killing ingredient of human tears and it is also a chief component of fluid from the joints of patients with arthritis. Type IIa PLA2 is present in abnormally high levels in blood from humans with arthritis, burns, sepsis, ARDS, atherosclerosis, Crohn's disease, malaria, cancer and other chronic illnesses. These high levels can cause injury, tissue damage and pain due to too much inflammation and treatments are needed to stop or decrease effects of this enzyme . For these reasons this and related enzymes are thought to be potential targets for drugs which would act by blocking the functions of such an enzyme. Our group has been using computers to design new chemicals that can selectively fit into this enzyme and stick very tightly. We are determining the three dimensional structures of these chemicals in the enzyme to learn how to make them bind even more tightly. This information is allowing us to synthesize new selective drugs that stop PLA2 from promoting the development of disease. We propose to continue these studies towards developing powerful new antiinflammatory drugs that block the enzyme, and to demonstrate possible benefits of these drugs by testing them in animal models of arthritis, sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), period pain, malaria, and cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Fairlie","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0030610","middle_name":"Paul","last_name":"Fairlie","source_individual_id":"RMIS20617","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Fairlie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84952","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Taylor","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010587","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Taylor","source_individual_id":"RMIS41211","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Taylor"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79577","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2320","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A vaccine to break tolerance to cervical carcinoma oncoprotein","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Cancer Vaccine","T cell immunotherapy","dendritic cells","peripheral tolerance","transgenic mouse"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143044,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Immunotherapy","Vaccine"],"scientific_title":"A vaccine to break tolerance to cervical carcinoma oncoprotein","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Tumour Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof ROBERT TINDLE","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143044","simplified_title":"Overcoming immune response non-reactivity in cervical cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"212036.72","source_system":"Evidence that cervical cancer is caused by Human Papillomavirus is compelling. Once the virus enters the cells of the cervix, it produces a protein named E7 which functions to make the cells cancerous. Cervical cancer is the fifth commonest cause of death in women in Australia, and the major killer of women world-wide. The E7 protein is the ideal target for a vaccine since it occurs only in the tumour cells. Cervical tumour cells are killed by specialised immune system cells termed CTLs which recognised fragments of the E7 molecule on their surface, bound to 'self' MHC molecules. Our laboratory has developed several mouse models of human cervical cancer, and has worked out which parts of the E7 protein are important in developing an appropriate immune response to control tumour growth. However a major finding is that the E7 molecules render the CTL cell population incapable of making an appropriate response to kill the tumour cells. We believe that this process, termed 'tolerance induction' can be overcome by using a novel approach as follows. Specialised antigen presenting cells , termed 'dendritic cells' (DCs) will be isolated and made to produce E7 protein by infecting them with a geneticlly modified virus (Adenovirus) which expresses E7 and specialised DC activators molecules, but is incapable of itself replicating. The dendritic cells will be re-introduced into the host as a vaccine, and will present the E7 to the immune system in such a way that tolerance will be broken. In other words the vaccine recipient will again be able to make a CTL immune response to the E7 protein in their tumours, and so be able to kill the tumour cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Tindle","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028412","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Tindle","source_individual_id":"RMIS388145","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Tindle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84347","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2319","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Japanese encephalitis virus in Australasia: molecular studies of isolates and consequences of immunisation.","data":{"media_summary":"vector and vertebrate host ecology","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Immunisation","Japanese encephalitis virus","Quasi-species","antibody-dependent enhancement","mosquito transmission"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143043,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Immunisation","emerging diseases","encephalitis","spread of mosquito-borne disease","vector and vertebrate host ecology"],"scientific_title":"Japanese encephalitis virus in Australasia: molecular studies of isolates and consequences of immunisation.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Virology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof John MacKenzie","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143043","simplified_title":"Japanese encpehalitis virus in Australasia: will immunisation strategies be successful for population protection.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"212036.72","source_system":"Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus of Asia.

There are over 50,000 cases annually in Asia, with about 12,000 fatalities.The virus normally circulates between mosquitoes and water birds and between mosquitoes and pigs. The World Health Organization has recognised JE as one of the most important mosquito-borne viruses because of its propensity to spread and to colonise new areas. The virus first appeared in northern Australia in the Torres Strait in 1995, causing three clinical cases of whom 2 died, and returned again in 1998, with a further case in the Torres Strait and the first case to occur on mainland Australia in Cape York. Both of these patients recovered. The virus returned again to the Torres Strait in 2000, but so far without causing human disease. We have shown that the virus is established in Papua New Guinea (PNG), where it is spreading rapidly, and our results suggest that PNG was the source of the virus causing the outbreaks in 1995 and 1998.

Furthermore, it aims to determine the status of these elements in breast cancer patients, thus expanding our knowledge of the actual contribution disruption of this gene makes to this disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Melissa Brown","data":{"first_name":"Melissa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0041312","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS511711","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Melissa Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87712","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2316","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The biosynthesis of Mycobactin T, a virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Enzymology","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Mycobactin biosynthesis","Non-ribosomal peptide synthase","Protein expression and Purification"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143031,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Antibiotic","Drug Target","Drug resistance","Tuberculosis"],"scientific_title":"The biosynthesis of Mycobactin T, a virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Enzymes","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof James De VOSS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143031","simplified_title":"How is Mycobactin T, a virulence enhancing molecule from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, made?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"211527.54","source_system":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis. The drug isoniazid led to a dramatic and sustained decline in mortality due to tuberculosis. This led to it being described in medical literature in 1988 as a disappearing disease which was now fairly easy to treat. However, the advent of HIV and the rapid rise of multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis led to dramatic changes. The risk that an HIV infected individual will develop active tuberculosis is 7% per year, compared to a lifetime risk of 10% for an immunocompetent person. Similarly, the prevalence of drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis is over 5% in many regions, including SE asia. Mycobacterial infections are regarded as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality world wide and WHO estimates that 30 million deaths will occur in the next decade due to these infections. Clearly, new drugs are required to combat the rising menace of this organism. The aim of this project is to detail the unique metabolic pathways in M. tuberculosis that produce Mycobactin T, essential to the virulence of this organism. Mycobactin T helps the bacteria obtain iron, an essential nutrient. These factors make the mycobaction pathway an ideal drug target and an understanding of its biochemistry is essential to its eventual exploitation for intervention in M. tuberculosis infections. We hypothesise that it may already provide the unknown site of action of a clinically employed, antituberculosis drug para-aminosalicylate (PAS). This project will i) fully define the structure of mycobactin T; ii) clone and overexpress key genes which catalyse the first three steps of mycobactin formation; iii) purify and characterise the overexpressed proteins with respect to their biochemical function; iv) examine the interaction of PAS with the proteins likely to be targeted by this antimycobacterial agent. The results of this work will provide the basis for the development of future anti-tuberculosis drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof James De Voss","data":{"first_name":"James","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018621","middle_name":"J","last_name":"De Voss","source_individual_id":"RMIS58959","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof James De Voss"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81771","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2315","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A genetic study of schizophrenia in the Brahmin of Tamil Nadu","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Linkage (genetics)","Linkage disequilibrium","Population isolate","Psychiatric Phenomenology","Schizophrenia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143027,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Schizophrenia - Aetiology","Schizophrenia - Diagnosis","Schizophrenia - Genetics"],"scientific_title":"A genetic study of schizophrenia in the Brahmin of Tamil Nadu","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Bryan Mowry","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143027","simplified_title":"A study of schizophrenia in a genetically distinct population of southern India","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"267226.72","source_system":"The cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but there is good evidence that genes play a role. Geneticists do not fully understand how it is inherited, but it is very complex, and several interacting genes as well as environmental factors are probably involved. Societies such as Australia are genetically diverse because people from many different ethnic groups have intermarried. To detect susceptibility genes in this type of population, we must study very large patient samples. Alternatively, we can study genetically homogenous patient samples, found in isolated gene-pool populations. One such population is the Brahmin people in Tamil Nadu, a south-eastern state of India. The Brahmin are descended from the Aryan peoples who migrated into southern India 2000 years ago. In the Hindu caste system, Brahmin are the highly educated priest class, and enjoy a privileged position in society. Traditionally, marriages among the Brahmin of Tamil Nadu have been prearranged, with a preference for first-cousin marriages. As well as this cultural and historical evidence, genetic marker studies confirm that this population is a suitable genetic isolate. In this project, genetic material (DNA) will be collected from Brahmin schizophrenic patients and their families. Diagnostic data, detailed family data, and blood samples will be gathered from 90-100 extended families, each containing two or more ill individuals. Analysis of their genetic code will enable a search for possible schizophrenia susceptibility genes and a systematic search for a mutation. If found, this will greatly improve our understanding of schizophrenia, and stimulate the search for similar genes in other samples world-wide, including Australia where schizophrenia costs $3 billion annually in terms of treatment and lost jobs. If schizophrenia genes can be found, it may be possible to find better treatments that correct the basic causes of the illness and identify factors that protect against the illness."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Bryan Mowry","data":{"first_name":"Bryan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044411","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Mowry","source_individual_id":"5016586","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Bryan Mowry"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88510","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Rangaswamy Thara","data":{"first_name":"Rangaswamy","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028354","middle_name":"","last_name":"Thara","source_individual_id":"RMIS51648","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Rangaswamy Thara"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84327","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Derek Nancarrow","data":{"first_name":"Derek","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0026955","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Nancarrow","source_individual_id":"RMIS7763","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Derek Nancarrow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83977","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2314","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A prospective study of traumatic stress in children involved in motor vehicle accidents","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Children","Motor vehicle accidents","Prospective methods","Traumatic stress"],"nhmrc_grant_id":143021,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Acute and chronic anxiety reactions","Children's mental health and adjustment","Post traumatic stress disorder"],"scientific_title":"A prospective study of traumatic stress in children involved in motor vehicle accidents","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Justin Kenardy","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143021","simplified_title":"PTSD in children involved in motor vehicle accidents","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"185889.18","source_system":"Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are relatively frequent major life trauma that represent significant life threatening experiences.

More detailed studies on selected RGS proteins will include mutational analysis of functional domains within the proteins and identification of other proteins that interact with RGS proteins. Overall these studies will lead us to understand how specific RGS proteins interact with G proteins and other molecules to regulate signalling in the secretory pathway. Anomalies in cell signalling have severe consequences in a variety of diseases and can cause cancer.

On average 3-4% of liveborn babies have a major congenital abnormality, and of the 15-20% of pregnancies which spontaneously abort, many are due to chromosomal or other developmental anomalies. A common feature of many developmental disorders is dysmorphology of the face, suggesting that genes important in patterning the face are also important in the development of other organ systems. During development of the embryo many of the features of the face derive from a series of swellings termed the pharyngeal arches. The complex processes which determine how the face develops are in a large part controlled by the co-ordinated expression of a large number of genes in the first two of the five pharyngeal arch pairs. While we know some of the genes involved in these processes, the precise mechanisms of craniofacial development are relatively poorly understood. In this project we propose a large scale approach to identifying genes involved in development of the mammalian face and to further delineating their role in development and human disease. This approach takes advantage of state of the art genomic technologies available at the IMB and through existing collaborations overseas. In collaboration with Dr Bento Soares (University of Iowa) we have constructed a library containing all of the genes which are expressed in the first two pairs of pharyngeal arches in the developing mouse embryo. Using an approach designed to eliminate all those genes which are expressed in all or most tissues of the body and play a general role in the body's metabolism, we will select for those genes which play a specific and important role in embryonic development. We will then isolate the human counterparts of these genes and more thoroughly investigate their role in embryonic development and disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Carol Wicking","data":{"first_name":"Carol","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028805","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Wicking","source_individual_id":"RMIS2473798","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Carol Wicking"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84461","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2309","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Central control of stress-induced changes in immune function.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis","Infection","Neuroendocrinology","Neuroimmune interactions","Stress"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142990,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Brain pathways mediating stress and immune interactions","Effects of stress on infection","Neural substrates for therapeutic intervention of stress","Psychological stress"],"scientific_title":"Central control of stress-induced changes in immune function.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Central Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Kathryn Buller","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142990","simplified_title":"How stress can make you sick.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"411724.12","source_system":"LONG-TERM STRESS CAN ALTER OUR BRAIN'S ATTEMPTS TO FIGHT INFECTION Long-term stress is often blamed for causing illness but precisely how this occurs is now only beginning to be realised. It is especially disturbing that long-term stress can increase one's susceptibility to infections. Stress can alter the way our brain can help deal with assaults by bacteria and viruses. Normally, at the start of an infection, we release a hormone called cortisol from our adrenal glands. A low level of cortisol in our body is beneficial because it can prevent the infection from taking hold in our body and spreading. However if we are chronically stressed our brains tell the adrenal glands to secrete excessive amounts of cortisol over long periods of time and this imbalance can actually hinder the ability of one's immune system to fight an infection. The unfortunate consequence is that the infection is more likely to win the battle and spread to cause further havoc. The present study will identify which areas of the brain are important in driving the secretion of cortisol during infection and how long-term stress can influence those areas. Because we might be exposed to long-term psychological stress that is repeated regularly or irregularly we will determine which pattern of stress has the greatest effect. An investigation into how the brain operates during long-term stress and infection will help us develop ways to prevent stress from disrupting our immune systems."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kathryn Buller","data":{"first_name":"Kathryn","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006311","middle_name":"Marie","last_name":"Buller","source_individual_id":"5013676","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Kathryn Buller"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78421","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Trevor Day","data":{"first_name":"Trevor","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001209","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Day","source_individual_id":"5014239","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Trevor Day"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76996","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2308","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Functional analysis of human MC1R polymorphisms in directing melanocyte phenotype","data":{"media_summary":"Skin colour","end_year":2003,"keywords":["G-protein coupled receptors","Melanocortin-1 receptor","Melanocyte","Pigmentation","Tyrosinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142988,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Freckles","Hair colour","Melanoma","Moles","Skin colour"],"scientific_title":"Functional analysis of human MC1R polymorphisms in directing melanocyte phenotype","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"A/Pr Richard Sturm","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142988","simplified_title":"Role of MC1R gene polymorphisms in human pigmentation","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"361527.54","source_system":"Sunsmart campaigns are a unifying element in the lives of many Australians who wish to ensure protection against the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays in sunlight. Indeed, Australians have the highest incidence of UV-induced melanoma in the world. Although it is evident that lighter skin colours are more susceptible to sun damage, the relationship between sun exposure, skin type and melanoma formation is less clear. An essential first step in understanding the complex interactions that give rise to melanoma, and in identifying individuals that have a high susceptibility, is to reduce phenotypic analyses to genotypic classifications. As pigmentation phenotype is a factor of central importance in determining an individuals risk for melanoma, characterisation of the genes underlying the physical qualities of human eye, hair and skin colour will give a more direct and accurate genotypic assessment of risk. Results from an epidemiology study of melanoma patients in Queensland have identified a number of genetic changes within the melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor (MC1R) gene that associate with skin, hair and eye colour as well as with incidence of melanoma. Further investigation of MC1R gene alleles which segregate with skin and hair colours will provide the beginning for a whole new genotype-based classification of skin colour and melanoma risk, and will significantly contribute to our understanding of what makes some individuals highly susceptible to melanoma while others are not. Indeed, MC1R polymorphisms may numerically be the most important melanoma predisposition gene yet identified, exerting its effects as one of those common genes of small effect which may account for much more of the case load in melanoma than rarer genes of large effect.

Periodontal disease results in destruction of bone around teeth, loosening of teeth, compromised chewing function, and tooth loss. Over the last twenty years reports into the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on the skeleton have been divided and controversial. While historically PGE2 has been reported to promote bone resorption, more recently it has been demonstrated that when PGE is placed in contact with mandibular bone, adjacent to erupted teeth, new bone and cementum formation occurs. The ability of PGE2 to induce new bone formation indicates a potential use for PGE2 in the management of bone loss associated with periodontal diseases, and the formation of new bone around dental implants, and around teeth following orthodontic movement. Growth factors are active in healing and have valuable applications in augmenting wound repair. Osseous and dental tissues are rich in growth factors, and these factors are involved with the regulation of bone metabolism as well as tissue repair, thus the action of PGE2 on the periodontium is most likely regulated via these factors. Since regeneration of the periodontium is a fundamental goal of dentistry, any treatment which leads to predictable formation of new connective tissues and their long term stability would be a major clinical advance."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Laurence Walsh","data":{"first_name":"Laurence","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040305","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Walsh","source_individual_id":"RMIS12116","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Laurence Walsh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87441","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Anne Symons","data":{"first_name":"Anne","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039972","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Symons","source_individual_id":"RMIS12110","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Anne Symons"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87357","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2305","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Genomic and proteomic dissection of the molecular basis of kidney development.","data":{"media_summary":"renal disease","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Wilms' tumour suppressor protein","developmental genetics","gene regulation","kidney development","molecular biology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142978,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Denys Drash syndrome","Wilms' tumour","mesangial sclerosis","nephron endowment","renal disease"],"scientific_title":"Genomic and proteomic dissection of the molecular basis of kidney development.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

This is likely to be due to slight variations in the rate of nephron formation during development. Evidence is mounting that a reduced number of nephrons can predispose to renal failure later in life in response to stresses such as hypertension or substance abuse. 80,000 new cases of end stage renal failure occur each year in the US, with 25% of these related to hypertension and therefore possibly linked to a low nephron number. While it is known that the kidney arises through a series of reciprocal inductive events between the metanephric mesenchyme and the ureteric bud, a better understanding of the molecular basis of these events is needed to understand what dictates nephron endowment. The Wilms tumour suppressor protein WT1 is not only mutated in some cases of the childhood kidney cancer, Wilms tumour, but is also critical for the normal development of the metanephros, as demonstrated by knockout experiments in mice. One of the earliest genes expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme, WT1 is thought to prevent this tissue from dying before differentiation, directing it to form the kidney and, postnatally, regulating normal podocyte function. Although known to be a nuclear regulatory protein, the genes directly regulated by WT1 have not been clearly or convincingly delineated. This study aims to directly screen for changes to gene expression and protein production levels induced by WT1. To do so, an array approach unique in its use of a specific array set derived from developing kidney will be used. In concert, additional specific clone sets derived from mouse kidney prior and post the commencement of nephron formation will be constructed and analysed. As WT1 is a nuclear protein involved in splicing, this study will involve a parallel investigation at a proteomic level of changes in spliceosomal proteins in response to changes in WT1."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Melissa Little","data":{"first_name":"Melissa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038091","middle_name":"Helen","last_name":"Little","source_individual_id":"5012687","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Melissa Little"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86868","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2304","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of Crim-1 in lens development and eye disease.","data":{"media_summary":"nuclear sclerosis of the lens","end_year":2003,"keywords":["TGFbeta superfamily members","developmental genetics","lens development","molecular biology","transgenesis and gene knockouts"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142977,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["aftercataract","cataracts","eye disease","lens development","nuclear sclerosis of the lens"],"scientific_title":"The role of Crim-1 in lens development and eye disease.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Ophthalmology and Vision Science","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Melissa Little","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142977","simplified_title":"The role of a novel gene in diseases of the lens","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"We have recently isolated a novel gene (Crim1) and shown it to be strongly expressed during eye development. Its protein structure indicates that it may act to regulate the activities of two growth factor families, the TGF superfamily and the insulin-IGFs. These growth factors effect the behaviour of many cell types that influence events in normal and pathological development. For example in the eye lens, TGF 1 can induce cataractous changes in epithelial cells and early differentiating fibres; however, TGF signalling appears to be required for events in late stages of fibre cell maturation. Cataract is the leading cause of blindness and arises when lens cell architecture is disrupted and-or proteins aggregate abnormally. In humans, following ocular trauma, eye surgery, or in association with other diseases, cataracts can develop. These cataracts feature the development of subcapsular fibrotic plaques which obscure vision. We have shown that lenses cultured in the presence of TGF can mimic production of these plaques suggesting that these cataracts result from inappropriate activation of TGF . TGF is expressed in the lens and is abundant in the ocular media that bathes the lens. Thus, it appears that complex regulation of TGF bioavailability is required; epithelial cells and young fibre cells need to be protected from its cataractogenic effects, whereas older fibres require TGF signalling for maturation and-or survival. The expression pattern of Crim1 in the lens is consistent with it having a key role in inhibiting TGF in the lens. Thus, we hypothesise that Crim1 plays important roles in the lens, possibly via the modulation of members of the TGF superfamily and insulin-IGFs. We predict that Crim1 acts to maintain the lens epithelial phenotype and facilitate events in early fibre differentiation. If so, this may have implications for devising molecular strategies for preventing or slowing diseases, such as the various forms of human cataract."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Frank Lovicu","data":{"first_name":"Frank","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043889","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Lovicu","source_individual_id":"5016055","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Frank Lovicu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88374","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Melissa Little","data":{"first_name":"Melissa","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038091","middle_name":"Helen","last_name":"Little","source_individual_id":"5012687","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Melissa Little"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86868","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Johnston Mcavoy","data":{"first_name":"Johnston","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008972","middle_name":"William","last_name":"Mcavoy","source_individual_id":"RMIS3721859","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Johnston Mcavoy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79132","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2303","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structure-function analysis of nuclear receptor and cofactor action: evidence for a role in muscle.","data":{"media_summary":"Rhabdomyosarcoma","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Differentiation","Nuclear Receptor Coactivators and Corepressors","Protein-Protein Interactions","Structure-Function Analysis of Nuclear Receptors","Transcriptional Coregulators and Development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142971,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Basic Science","Biological Sciences","Endocrine disorders","Myopathy","Rhabdomyosarcoma"],"scientific_title":"Structure-function analysis of nuclear receptor and cofactor action: evidence for a role in muscle.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Gene Expression","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"GENETICS","cia_name":"Prof George Muscat","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142971","simplified_title":"Hormonal Control of Muscle Differentiation","sub_type":"Standard Project with Research Fellowship","total_budget":"692040.16","source_system":"Hormone receptors have critical roles in almost all aspects of physiology by transducing the effects of hormones into metabolic responses. There are ~45 orphan hormone receptors encoded by distinct genes in humans, since all receptors are important in the treatment of human disease, the plethora of orphan receptors has been the catalyst for the development of a new paradigm, reverse endocrinology. Reverse endocrinology is the process whereby the orphan hormone receptor is used to search for a previously unknown hormone, and metabolic pathway. We are interested in the orphan hormone receptors, Rev-erbA and RVR, orphan members of the receptor superfamily. Rev-erb alpha expression is regulated by fibrates, widely used hypolipidemic drugs, and the circadian cycle. Rev-erbs mediate the regulation of lipid metabolism and peroxisomal beta oxidation. Furthermore, Rev-erbs are acutely induced during brain seizures, postulated to regulate cerebellar plasticity, and involved in growth control. In view of these critical regulatory roles, and the success of reverse endocrinology to date, we intend to complete the structural analysis of the Rev-erb and RVR as a tool to identify the hormone that binds this receptor. Hormone receptors recruit proteins called nuclear receptor cofactors, that function as regulators of gene expression. The cofactors regulate gene expression and development. Furthermore these cofactors, when misregulated result in the onset of disease and carcinogenesis, which underscores the need for achieving a high resolution view of their function in many tissues. Along these lines, we are interested in exmining the function of these cofactors in muscle. Understanding the molecular role of the NR cofactors during muscle differentiation will be a critical step toward elucidating the dysregulation-function of these proteins in muscle diseases, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and inflammatory myopathy that have cofactor deficiency."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof George Muscat","data":{"first_name":"George","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026936","middle_name":"E.O","last_name":"Muscat","source_individual_id":"RMIS5658","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof George Muscat"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83974","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2302","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Role of the Growth Hormone Binding Protein as a Transcriptional Activator","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Hormone signalling","growth hormone","nuclear receptor","nuclear trafficking","transcriptional activation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142960,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Ageing","Cancer","Dwarfism"],"scientific_title":"Role of the Growth Hormone Binding Protein as a Transcriptional Activator","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Michael WATERS","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142960","simplified_title":"Gene Activation by the Extracellular Part of the Growth Hormone Receptor","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"387226.72","source_system":"Growth hormone is an important hormone therapeutic for treating dwarfism.

This would have the effect of augmenting the normal action of GH to regulate gene readout. We have exciting preliminary data which makes us think this may be a new mechanism for hormone activation of genes. The level of GHBP in the nucleus is regulated, and if a defect in export of the GHBP occurred, this would lead to accumulation of nuclear GHBP and stimulate cell proliferation.

This project seeks to find out how growth hormone sends its signal into the target cell through its surface receptor. It is believed that the primary event in signalling is the ability of the hormone to bring two receptors together (receptor dimerization). However, it may be that the receptor already is dimerized, and the role of the hormone is to induce a specific change in shape of the receptor, which transfers the signal of hormone binding into the cell to initiate signalling to the genome. We have good evidence that a specific shape change is required for activation of an important signalling pathway by growth hormone, and the closely structurally related receptor for erythropoietin is already dimerized before hormone binds. We want to find out exactly how the shape change acts, and whether the receptor is predimerized. This information is vital for designing small orally active mimics of growth hormone which could be of great value as an anabolic supplement for the frail elderly."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Waters","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022867","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Waters","source_individual_id":"RMIS47580","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Waters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82896","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2300","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) is a key regulator of skeletal adaptation and remodelling","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["bone adaptation","bone remodelling","cyclooxygenase-2","fracture healing","mechanical stress"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142958,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["age-related skeletal disorders","fracture repair","osteoarthritis","osteoporosis"],"scientific_title":"Prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) is a key regulator of skeletal adaptation and remodelling","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Orthopaedics","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Mark Forwood","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142958","simplified_title":"Prostaglandin enzymes mediate normal bone turnover and adaptation.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"301018.36","source_system":"Knowledge of the biology underlying bone formation is important for developing novel approaches to stimulate new bone formation in skeletal diseases associated with ageing or disability, or for maintenance of new bone around orthopaedic or dental implants.

This project will investigate the regulation of prostaglandin production by PGHS enzymes following mechanical loading in vivo. It will use cell, molecular and histochemical techniques to determine if the genes that regulate the enzymes are influenced by mechanical stimuli, and if they are dependent on other molecules, associated with structural proteins (stress fibres) within the cell.

Unfortunately, effective treatments are not available and so 1500 Australians commence dialysis on an artifical kidney machine every year. The main determinant of chronic kidney failure is scarring and damage to kidney tubules, which in many cases progresses to end-stage kidney failure, even if the original cause of the kidney injury is removed. Kidney scarring and damage appears to be caused by both decreases in protective factors and increases in damaging factors (called cytokines). These different factors interact with each other such that attempts to treat kidney disease by blocking a single type of cytokine is ineffective because of compensation by other cytokines. This project looks at the role of a kidney protective factor called nitric oxide (NO) in preventing scarring in human kidney cells grown in tissue culture. In three different models of human kidney disease, we will specifically focus on how the protective effects of NO are influenced by, and in turn influnce the actions of other cytokines. Armed with the knowledge of how these agents interact with each other, trials will be undertaken to prevent scarring and damage to kidney cells using a combination of agents which will simultaneously increase NO levels and block one or more injurious cytokines. The success of such a combined approach will go a long way towards developing new and effective treatment strategies for people with chronic kidney disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Glenda Gobe","data":{"first_name":"Glenda","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042655","middle_name":"Carolyn","last_name":"Gobe","source_individual_id":"5012448","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Glenda Gobe"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88060","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Zoltan Endre","data":{"first_name":"Zoltan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042272","middle_name":"H","last_name":"Endre","source_individual_id":"RMIS30819","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Zoltan Endre"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87972","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr David Vesey","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0034467","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Vesey","source_individual_id":"RMIS387799","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr David Vesey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85922","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Johnson","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0013969","middle_name":"Wayne","last_name":"Johnson","source_individual_id":"RMIS14680","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Johnson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80471","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2298","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"CTL avidity as a determinant of the mature, antigen-specific immune repertoire","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["CTL","Cell-mediated immunity","TCR","tetramer technology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142952,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["CTL activation","Cervical Cancer","HPV"],"scientific_title":"CTL avidity as a determinant of the mature, antigen-specific immune repertoire","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Graham Leggatt","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142952","simplified_title":"Controlling CTL avidity","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"241527.54","source_system":"Killer T lymphocytes are a diverse population which vary in their ability to recognise infected cells.

One major contrast between the two hemispheres concerns their cognitive and emotional styles. The left hemisphere plans and confidently smooths over discrepancies that do not fit the plan while the right hemisphere looks at all possibilities and cautiously highlights the discrepancies. This research project studies the switch between the two hemispheres that alternately activates these contrasting, but equally valid, viewpoints. The switch is studied directly by optical recording from animal brains. The switch can also be studied in humans using a recent discovery from our laboratory:- that the perceptual rivalries are mediated by a hemispheric switch mechanism. Perceptual rivalry is a phenomenon where continuous, but ambiguous, stimulation leads to a back-and-forth alternation of complementary percepts, a phenomenon that fascinated Salvador Dali and is featured in many of his paintings. The nature of the perceptual switch during rivalry has been debated for centuries. New experiments link perceptual rivalry to the switch of attention between the hemispheres. Using perceptual rivalry as an indirect way to monitor hemispheric switching in humans, we discovered a remarkable feature. The back-and-forth switching process of perceptual rivalry is significantly slower in subjects with bipolar disorder (manic depression), even when they are between episodes and their mood is normal. The timing of the switching process is very stable in an individual, and appears to be similar in identical twins. The speed of the switch mechanism may therefore be inherited. Altered neural rhythms may underly the predisposition, known to run in familes, from which bipolar disorder can be triggered. The aim of the project is to test these propositions about the basis of this common disorder, affecting 1-2% of the population.."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"John Pettigrew","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0015559","middle_name":"","last_name":"Pettigrew","source_individual_id":"RMIS31384","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"John Pettigrew"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80922","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2296","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Modulating retinal glutamate transport in health and disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Excitotoxicity","Glutamate","Glutamate transporter","Retina"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142943,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Central retinal artery occlusion","Central retinal vein occlusion","Glaucoma","Stroke"],"scientific_title":"Modulating retinal glutamate transport in health and disease","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Sensory Systems","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Nigel Barnett","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142943","simplified_title":"Modulating retinal glutamate transport in health and disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"256527.54","source_system":"Damage can occur to nervous tissues like the retina and brain when there is a reduction in the blood supply.

Much of the neuronal damage is due to the release of an excess of glutamate. Glutamate is a chemical (neurotransmitter) that nerves use to communicate with each other, but it is toxic to nerves when present at high concentrations. This project will investigate the mechanisms that regulate the concentration of glutamate in the retina. If these mechanisms could be made to work more efficiently, they may prevent the build-up of the glutamate and therefore prevent damage to the nerve cells.

It has become increasingly clear that these different molecules interact with one another and that these interactions are functionally important. In this proposal we will study the association between a signaling molecule, the receptor tyrosine phosphatase RPTPk, and a cell-cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin. RPTPk removes phosphate molecules from tyrosines, an important event that controls many signaling processes; E-cadherin is a major adhesion molecule responsible for cell-cell contact and patterning, and whose dysfunction is involved in tumor invasion. My collaborators and I have recently demonstrated that RPTPk and E-cadherin bind to one another, but the function of this association is unclear. I will test the general hypothesis that these molecules form a signaling complex, that can regulate both the activity of RPTPk and the adhesive function of E-cadherin to ultimately control the way in which cells associate with one another. This work will make an important contribution to our understanding of how cells signal to one another, and provide insights into how cell-cell adhesion and recognition may be perturbed in disease conditions, such as tumor progression."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alpha Yap","data":{"first_name":"Alpha","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034891","middle_name":"S.","last_name":"Yap","source_individual_id":"5018525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Alpha Yap"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86044","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2294","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Fetal intrapartum pulse oximetry: a multicentre randomised controlled trial","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["fetal","obstetrics","operative delivery","oxygen saturation"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142936,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["fetal distress","labour","operative delivery","oxygen saturation"],"scientific_title":"Fetal intrapartum pulse oximetry: a multicentre randomised controlled trial","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Paul Colditz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142936","simplified_title":"Trial of fetal pulse oximetry during labour","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"246001.27","source_system":"Current methods of monitoring the well-being of the unborn baby during labour often result in concern about the unborn baby's health.

By finding genes which cause diabetes we have the opportunity to unravel much of the mystery of this condition. This research program will find genes which cause diabetes by searching for them in large pedigrees in which many family members are affected by diabetes. Finding the genes which cause diabetes will have a significant impact in at least three major ways. Firstly, it will increase our understanding of the disease process. Secondly, it will be possible to develop tests to identify people at risk of diabetes at a very early stage so that therapy can be introduced and complications averted.

The costs (financial and other) to both the individuals involved, and the community in general, is very high. However the outlook for those affected by this condition is improving. Recent research has focused on the development of neural rescue therapies, which may decrease the extent of disabilities suffered by these children. The same treatments may also be helpful in children following near drowning and head trauma. Neural rescue therapies must be applied less than 24 hours following the event which has caused the reduction in oxygen supply. Thus, before these treatments can be tested, it is necessary to find a way to quickly tell which babies may benefit from the treatments. This study will trial a new method which is inexpensive and can be used without moving the baby away from its incubator. This technique involves a new application of an established technology to detect the redistribution of water within the brain one of the earliest signs of impending brain cell death.

Back pain is one of the main causes of work injury and lost time from work. The longer a person is off work, the harder it is to get them back to work. Workers' compensation systems around Australia aim at getting the injured worker with back pain back to work as soon as possible. One of the difficulties in this process is determining what the person with back pain can physically do in the workplace. An evaluation technique, called functional capacity evaluation (known as FCE), is one method used to find out what the person with back pain physically can and cannot do. In a FCE, a trained health professional such as an occupational therapist, observes the person performing a range of physical activities like the ones he or she may have to perform in a job. The therapist closely observes the person performing activities such as lifting, carrying, kneeling, crouching, balancing, and walking and notes any limitations in the person's ability to complete the activities. The therapist makes comments about what difficulties the person may have on the job and recommendations about how these could be reduced or eliminated. The information gained from these evaluations can be valuable for the treating doctor in deciding whether the person is ready to go back to work and what duties the person can and cannot do on the job. Because of such value they provide, FCE is commonly used in rehabilitation programs endorsed by workers' compensation systems around Australia. This widespread use and endorsement of FCE occurs despite limited research on the soundness of the ratings made from these evaluations. There is a need to see whether recommendations made from FCEs are consistent between therapists (i.e. reliable) and to see if the FCE accurately predicts the person's physical capacity for work. This research will examine these issues with injured workers with back pain."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Elizabeth Gibson","data":{"first_name":"Elizabeth","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0030880","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Gibson","source_individual_id":"RMIS22367","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Elizabeth Gibson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85005","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Heather Podlich","data":{"first_name":"Heather","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0015623","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Podlich","source_individual_id":"RMIS409586","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Heather Podlich"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80941","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jenny Strong","data":{"first_name":"Jenny","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0010483","middle_name":"-","last_name":"Strong","source_individual_id":"RMIS22364","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jenny Strong"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79549","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2290","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"G2 phase cdk2/cyclin A co-ordinates multiple pathways in G2/M progression","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["G2 checkpoint control","cell cycle regulation","mitosis","protein kinase pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142923,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["cancer","chemotherapy","hyperproliferative diseases"],"scientific_title":"G2 phase cdk2/cyclin A co-ordinates multiple pathways in G2/M progression","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

If this strict ordering of events is in any way disrupted, the resultant daughter cells would have a different complement of DNA from their parent cell, essentially mutant cells. The cell has established a mechanism to ensure the correct ordering of these crucial events, known as the cell cycle, and mechanisms that can respond to disruptions in this ordering and halt the normal cell cycle mechanism until the fault is rectified. These are the checkpoint controls. Checkpoint controls also respond to environmental stresses such as toxins that can damage the DNA to produce mutations. In diseases such as cancer, these checkpoint mechanisms are often faulty, allowing the cells to accumulate DNA mutations which can ultimately result in the cells becoming the aggresive, malignant tumours associated with the worst forms of this disease. Thus a detailed understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in normal cell cycle and checkpoint control is important in not only defining the causes of these diseases at a molecular level, but may ultimately provide molecular targets for drugs that specifically destroy cancer cells by targeting the faulty checkpoint control. This proposal will investigate one component of the cell cycle mechanism, cdk2-cyclin A, which also has a major role in checkpoint control, to determine its exact role in both these important cellular growth controls."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007391","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Gabrielli","source_individual_id":"5014734","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78693","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2289","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon growth and guidance in the vertebrate nervous system","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["axon growth","axon guidance","axon tracts","development","growth cone"],"nhmrc_grant_id":142919,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["brain disease","brain lesion","nerve regeneration"],"scientific_title":"Molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon growth and guidance in the vertebrate nervous system","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Nervous System","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Brian Key","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/142919","simplified_title":"Axon growth in embryos","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"467545.9","source_system":"There are millions of nerve cells in the vertebrate brain, each forming very precise and specific connections within neural circuits.

In this project we will test our newly developed inhibitors of E2F1 on various tumour cells derived from head and neck cancers to see how effective they are at stopping tumour cell growth.

The requirement of the developing embryo for cholesterol has been linked to the patched-hedgehog signalling pathway which we have previously shown to be central to mammalian development as well as tumour formation. In particular, the patched protein which is responsible for regulating signalling through this complex cascade of protein interactions has a domain similar to that which in other proteins has been shown to detect and respond to intracellular levels of cholesterol. The patched protein binds to hedgehog at the surface of the cell and mediates the transduction of the the hedgehog signal into the cell. By analogy to the role of sterol sensing domains in other proteins, we hypothesise that this domain in patched detects fluctuations in intracellular cholesterol levels which in turn alter trafficking of patched to the cell surface where it can participate in the hedgehog receptor complex. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data which suggests that patched is normally localised both at the cell surface and intracellularly. We are proposing a series of experiments to test our hypothesis, most of which deal with determing the localisation of patched in a cell culure system exposed to agents aimed at varying the intracellular levels of cholesterol. Subcellular localisation of patched will be analysed by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and immunoblotting analysis. We will also test the ability of patched to aggregate at the cell surface with other molecules important in receiving and sending the hedgehog signal. The experiments in this proposal are likely to give the first clues as to the function of the sterol sensing domain in patched and its role in mediating the vital link between cholesterol and embryonic development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Carol Wicking","data":{"first_name":"Carol","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0028805","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Wicking","source_individual_id":"RMIS2473798","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Carol Wicking"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84461","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1779","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neuroendocrine functions of PrRP, a novel hypothalamic peptide","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Prolactin-releasing peptide","hypothalamus","luteinising hormone","pituitary gland","prolactin"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102607,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["amenorrhoea","hyperprolactinaemia","hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism"],"scientific_title":"Neuroendocrine functions of PrRP, a novel hypothalamic peptide","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Jon Curlewis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102607","simplified_title":"A new hormone produced by the brain","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"183928.12","source_system":"This project investigates the role of a newly discovered chemical (peptide) that is found in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus which regulates the activity of the pituitary gland.

We have recently identified a gene (designated hiaNm) which encodes a new protein which is located on the surface of the bacterium, in the outer membrane. There has been an enormous body of work done on the immunology, biochemistry and genetics of all components of the outer membrane of Neisseria meningitidis. Therefore the discovery of this novel protein provides an exciting opportunity to take a new direction in vaccine development. For an effective vaccine, the target molecule must be present in most strains; we have already shown that the hiaNm gene is present in all strains examined. In this proposal we describe a study of the vaccine potential and biological function of the hiaNm gene product HiaNm. We will express the protein at high levels, immunise mice, and produce antibodies against HiaNm to discover whether they can protect mice against meningococcal disease.

This proposal investiagtes the role of p16 in responses of normal skin cells to ultraviolet radiation. We will examine the increased levels of p16 detected in skin after exposure to low doses of ultraviolet radiation and attempt to define the growth responses of these cells to the increased p16 levels. This project will help to establish the normal role of p16 in cellular responses to ultraviolet radiation, and may also identify novel targets for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of melanoma."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli","data":{"first_name":"Brian","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007391","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Gabrielli","source_individual_id":"5014734","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Brian Gabrielli"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78693","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1775","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Probing central and peripheral calcium channel sybtypes with novel omega conotoxins","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["calcium channels","electrophysiology","omega conotoxins","peptide synthesis","structure-function activity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102585,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["neurotransmission","pain","stroke therapy"],"scientific_title":"Probing central and peripheral calcium channel sybtypes with novel omega conotoxins","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Richard Lewis","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102585","simplified_title":"New conotoxins that discriminate between peripheral and central calcium channels","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"383168.79","source_system":"New toxins including omega-conotoxin CVID have been discovered from fish eating cone snails found on the Great Barrier Reef.

These parasitic infections are increasingly being recognized as responsible for chronic illness in many industrialized countries as well. There are no vaccines currently available for the treatment of any of the human parasitic infections. In addition, the drugs that are currently used are becoming less effective because of the spread of drug resistant strains. Schistosomiasis, is the second most prevalent parasitic disease, after malaria, and is a leading cause of severe morbidity and death in many parts of the world. The disease is caused by flatworms or blood flukes, the eggs of which indirectly cause damage to the liver and spleen of infected individuals. These parasites feed on human red blood cells and use hemoglobin as their major food source. Our collaborative team (Brindley, Abbenante, Fairlie) has identified two enzymes that these flatworms need to use to eat red blood cells. This project aims to develop compounds that will stop these enzymes from functioning. These compounds will be tested to see whether they can cause the parasites to die of starvation. If successful these new compounds can be used as drugs to treat the disease and the general strategy can be applied to other blood-feeding parasites."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"John Abbenante","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0005696","middle_name":"","last_name":"Abbenante","source_individual_id":"RMIS34220","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"John Abbenante"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78255","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1773","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular genetics of gonadal development","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Expression cloning","Gonadal development","Organogenesis","Sex determination","Sex-determining genes"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102579,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Gonadal dysgenesis","Hermaphroditism","Sex reversal"],"scientific_title":"Molecular genetics of gonadal development","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

It is therefore important to understand the fundamental molecular genetics of development. We have discovered a novel human gene, termed S52, and its equivalent gene in the mouse. The predicted protein derived from these genes would indicate that S52 protein may interact with other proteins, possibly nerve growth factors, in the body to regulate normal development and possibly facilitate the survival of nerve cells in embryos. Strikingly, the worm C. elegans, an evoluationary very distant animal, also has a very similar gene to human. The fact that the protein has been so conserved throughout evolution supports the idea that S52 function is important in development. S52 mRNA is expressed in the developing brain, particularly in a special group of cells called the floor plate. Floor plate is a tissue that has ability to organize the patterning and differentiation of cells within the developing brain. S52 is also expressed in motor neurons in early stages of development and later in a subset of dorsal spinal cord neurons. We have mapped S52 to the short arm of human chromosome 2 (2p15-22). This region of chromosome 2 is linked to several human genetic diseases with neurological defects. Based on our preliminary data, we think S52 is not only important for normal brain development but may be mutated in a human neurological disease called Spastic Paraplegia Type 4 (SPG4) which is characterized by a degeneration of nerve cells in the spinal cord. The aim of this project is to further our understanding of the function of this gene and investigate its role in disease.

One of the most effective markers so far found to correlate with invasiveness of tumour cells, and hence lethality of melanoma, is the Beta3 integrin molecule.

It is not clear how expression of Beta 3 allows this change in growth state to occur and this research program is designed to test if Beta 3 is the direct cause of gene expression changes mediating the metastatic transformation. To provide insight into the genetic changes induced in melanoma cells expressing the Beta3 protein a screen for genes that are either activated or repressed in the presence of Beta3 will be performed. Non-metastatic melanoma cells will be transduced with the Beta 3 gene and a molecular technique applied to these cells that can identify genetic differences which will allow the cloning of differentially expressed genes. The gene fragments that are identified will first provide clues as to what the genes are that maybe switched on or off to allow the tumour to grow beneath the skin. They will also form the basis of a Ometastatic melanoma gene panelO that can be tested for its diagnostic value of tumours. The utility and reproducibility of the gene panel will be confirmed by testing melanoma cell lines and tumour tissue.

This can be beneficial in the short-term as it helps our body redistribute its pattern of energy utilization in a way that helps in coping with an unexpected challenge. However, excessive secretion of corticosterone due to excessive exposure to psychological stress can damage your health. For example, it can make you more susceptible to infection and also accelerate the rate at which your brain ages. The brain possesses certain mechanisms which try to limit the release of corticosterone when you are subjected to psychological stress. Unfortunately these mechanisms are not quite up to doing the necessary job under the conditions in which we live today, i.e. a very high level of psychological stress is a common feature of modern life. Nevertheless we believe that if we can properly understand these protective mechanisms in the brain, it may be possible to develop drugs which can boost their efficiency.

This was unexpected as the nearest known focus of virus activity was in Bali, over 3000km away. The virus returned again in 1998, with a further case in the Torres Strait and the first case to occur on mainland Australia in Cape York. Both of these patients recovered. We have shown that the virus is established in Papua New Guinea (PNG), where it is spreading rapidly, and our results suggest that PNG was the source of the virus causing the outbreaks in 1995 and 1998. This project is aimed at finding out more about JE virus in PNG, particularly as it relates to spread into northern Australia. The project also seeks to investigate the potential mosquito and animal hosts in Australia that might be involved if the virus becomes established in our wildlife in Cape York. Australia is already known to have suitable mosquito vector species and suitable animal hosts in water birds and feral pigs, but the ecology is not yet understood. Thus the overall aim is to provide information on which a sound risk assessment can be based."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Mackenzie","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008814","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mackenzie","source_individual_id":"RMIS218589","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Mackenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79086","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1762","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Study of papillomavirus DNA encapsidation and formation of infectious virions","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Medical virology","Molecular virology","Papillomavirus viral structure","Viral immunology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102525,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Antibody neutralization assay","DNA encapsidation","DNA packaging cell line","Infectious virions"],"scientific_title":"Study of papillomavirus DNA encapsidation and formation of infectious virions","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Infectious Diseases","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Kong-Nan Zhao","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102525","simplified_title":"DNA packaging by papillomavirus","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"214053.04","source_system":"Papillomavirus (PV) is a sexually-transmitted virus that is a major cause of cervical cancer.

Occasionally, however, melanoma in its early stages is successfully dealt with by the natural response of the immune system. In these cases, the immune system generates cancer-controlling killer T lymphocytes that enter the melanoma and kill the tumour cells. Killer T lymphocytes are generated by the lymph glands when the immune system is presented with melanoma cell components, or antigens, by specialised cells known as dendritic cells. This project consists of a clinical trial that aims to boost the natural ability of the immune system to generate killer cells by growing dendritic cells from the blood, mixing them with melanoma antigens, and then inject the mixture. When injected into the skin, dendritic cells quickly move to lymph glands to generate killer T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes can find their way to melanoma deposits all over the body.

Abnormal secretion of these hormones is seen in conditions such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, stress, critical illness, aging and many others with the result that patients have low levels of steroids in their blood and inactive gonads, changes which in themselves lead to other health problems. Because these hormones are essential for normal reproduction, it is possible that PACAP may play an important role in regulating this process, both under normal conditions and in disease.

This series of studies aims to examine the hormonal responses to physical exercise. In studies recently completed to determine how to detect Growth Hormone (GH) abuse in the Olympics, we have discovered a new system of hormones that respond to exercise. These Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGF) and their IGF-Binding Proteins (IGF-BP) are normally controlled by GH. The IGF-IGF-BP system normally acts to control of many cellular and organ functions in many different tissues of the body. For example they stimulate protein accumulation and muscle growth, and have actions to control blood glucose in conditions like diabetes. Little is known about what regulates the production of the IGF and IGF-BPs in response to physical exercise. We aim to examine whether GH, either as an acute pulse as occurs naturally, or a direct effect of exercise that is not GH-mediated, is responsible for the increase in IGF and IGFBPs. This may uncover a new means of controlling this powerful hormonal system. In addition, we will examine whether GH or IGF-I, alone and together, influence the body's ability to respond to the stress of exercise (e.g., controlling fuel use, cardiovascular and kidney responses). Such information will allow greater understanding of this important hormonal system, so that in novel therapies may be developed for conditions such as normal ageing, the wasting states that accompany severe surgical or infectious stress, or conditions with abnormal blood glucose regulation such as diabetes.

Antibodies are proteins which are produced by the human body to fight infection. We aim to study whether cytokines are secreted from infected human blood cells activated in this way and whether these cytokines cause blood vessels to become leaky.

The delivery system can be specifically tailored to transport a wide variety of peptides through the different biological barriers. The peptides can be conjugated to the delivery system in such a way as to release the peptide after it has been absorbed (prodrug), or to form a biologically stable and active novel molecule.

Unfortunately, these procedures may be less effective than usual, because the process of artery narrowing is more aggressive in patients with renal disease. Moreover, this process may cause patients with negative testing for coronary disease at one point in time to develop coronary problems over follow-up. In this study, we propose to use a standard stress testing protocol to stratify the risk of coronary events in a group of at risk patients on dialysis. Those at highest risk will undergo bypass surgery, while those at intermediate and low risk will be randomized to usual care, or an aggressive treatment of atheroma with cholesterol reduction, folic acid supplementation (aiming to normalize homocysteine), blood pressure and blood sugar control. The effects of this approach will be followed by examination of biochemical markers of atherosclerosis, and imaging of arterial thickness and reactivity (reflecting tests of structure and function of the vasculature). We will also assess of the progression or reduction of abnormal cardiac stress responses, and the occurence of events at follow-up. Finally, follow-up data will be used to compare the predictive value of the 2 stress testing protocols.

There is increasing evidence that multiple sclerosis is caused by repeated attacks on the nervous system by the white blood cells (lymphocytes) of the body's own immune system. A major unanswered question in multiple sclerosis is why repeated immune attacks on the nervous system occur. I have recently proposed that the repeated nature of the immune attacks in multiple sclerosis results from a failure of the mechanism that switches off immune attacks on the nervous system in healthy individuals. In an animal model of multiple sclerosis we have shown that the lymphocytes attacking the nervous system rapidly commit suicide in the nervous system by a process known as apoptosis, and that this is associated with switching off of the immune attack and recovery from the disease. The present project aims to study further this process of lymphocyte suicide in experimental animals by determining whether the lymphocyte suicide is mediated through a death receptor molecule named Fas (CD95). The project will also investigate the process of lymphocyte suicide in white blood cells obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis to determine if this process is defective and to determine whether these patients have abnormalities in the Fas molecular pathway. This project will shed light on the question of why repeated immune attacks on the nervous system occur in multiple sclerosis, and has the potential to lead to the development of new treatments for multiple sclerosis."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Pender","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0009604","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Pender","source_individual_id":"RMIS18293","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Pender"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79308","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1744","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Structural studies on SNARE proteins involved in insulin action","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["SNARE proteins","heterologous expression","protein structure","protein trafficking","vesicle transport"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102467,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["diabetes mellitus","hyperglycaemia","insulin resistance"],"scientific_title":"Structural studies on SNARE proteins involved in insulin action","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Jennifer Martin","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102467","simplified_title":"Understanding how insulin regulates blood glucose","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"308263.18","source_system":"Diabetes mellitus, a disease characterised by high blood glucose levels, is caused by a relative or absolute deficiency in the activity of insulin. The blood-glucose lowering action of insulin is a result of its ability to stimulate glucose uptake by fat and muscle cells. A major goal of Professor James' laboratory is to identify molecules that are involved in this insulin-regulated uptake of glucose. Professor James has identified and characterised the glucose transporter, GLUT4, a protein that is normally stored inside muscle and fat cells. In response to insulin stimulation, GLUT4 moves to the cell surface where it functions to transport glucose into the cell. Over the past 5 years Professor James laboratory has, in conjunction with other groups, discovered several key proteins that are involved in the insulin-regulated movement of GLUT4 within the cell. We plan to exploit the therapeutic potential of this biological system by obtaining high resolution three dimensional structures of these key proteins. The resulting structural information will allow us to develop compounds that modify the function of these key proteins. Such compounds could prove useful as novel therapeutic agents in the treatment of diabetes. The purpose of this proposal is to begin to implement this goal.

During embryonic development E-cadherin is essential for establishing the normal body pattern and the cellular architecture of many epithelial organs. Throughout life E-cadherin serves to maintain epithelial barriers, such as the lining of the digestive tract. E-cadherin has been clearly identified as a tumour suppressor molecule: loss of normal E-cadherin function leads to tumour metastasis and cancer invasion. It is therefore essential to understand the physiological function and regulation of E-cadherin in cells. E-cadherin is normally expressed on the surface of cells for adhesion to neighbouring cells. Recently, we found that cells can internalise and recycle this surface E-cadherin: even in mature epithelia, a proportion of the E-cadherin molecules appear to undergo constant movement in and out of the cell. It is likely that this mechanism participates in the dynamic remodelling of adhesive contacts between cells in organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and during wound healing. Corruption of this recycling mechanism could also potentially contribute to tumorigenesis. In this grant we propose to build upon this discovery by investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate E-cadherin recycling. We will characterize the cellular pathways by which E-cadherin is trafficked. The signaling pathways that regulate recycling will be analysed, since these may be perturbed in cancer and inflammation. Other molecules that interact with E-cadherin will be studied to determine whether they too recycle. The information from these studies will have broad implications for understanding the role of E-cadherin in healthy organs and in common cancers."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jennifer Stow","data":{"first_name":"Jennifer","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004860","middle_name":"Lea","last_name":"Stow","source_individual_id":"RMIS42387","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jennifer Stow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78016","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1738","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A polyepitope HPV16 E7 DNA vaccine restricted through multiple class 1 haplotypes protects against E7-expressing tumour","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Cancer vaccine","Cellular immunotherapy","Mice, transgenic","T-lymphocytes, cytotoxic"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102458,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Cervical cancer","Immunotherapy","vaccine therapy"],"scientific_title":"A polyepitope HPV16 E7 DNA vaccine restricted through multiple class 1 haplotypes protects against E7-expressing tumour","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Tumour Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof ROBERT TINDLE","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102458","simplified_title":"A cervical cancer vaccine for the out-bred human population","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"218244.4","source_system":"Evidence that cervical cancer is caused by Human Papillomavirus is compelling.

One animal model consists of mice which are genetically engineered to produce several types of selfmolecules and also E7. Thes mice develop skin tumours as result of E7 expression. This system provides model of cervical epithelial tumours caused by E7 expression in women.Thus we can ask the questions o can we elicit CTL responses which function in the context of humanself ? o Will these CTL responses prevent the growth of E7-induced epithelial tumours? The OUTCOME of the project will be a vaccine which will prevent the establishment of cervical cancer which can progress directly into clinical trials in women bearing appropriate selfmolecules."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Robert Tindle","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0028412","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Tindle","source_individual_id":"RMIS388145","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Robert Tindle"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84347","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1737","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Analysis of the C-terminal hypervariable region of Ras proteins","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Lipid modifications","Plasma membrane","Ras proteins","Vesicular trafficking"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102457,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Colon cancer","General Oncology","Leukaemia"],"scientific_title":"Analysis of the C-terminal hypervariable region of Ras proteins","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof John Hancock","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102457","simplified_title":"A study of the biology of Ras proteins","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"419241.16","source_system":"In human cancers one or more of the signaling pathways leading from growth factor receptors at the cell surface to the nucleus where cell division is initiated are subverted. For example, a protein called Ras, that regulates one major signaling pathway, is mutated in 90% of pancreatic cancers, 50% of colon cancers and 30% of acute leukaemias. This leaves Ras and the signaling pathway permanently switched on causing uncontrolled cell proliferation. The clinical impact of drugs that could neutralise Ras function in these tumours is potentially enormous. Our previous work demonstrated that Ras must be attached to the inner surface of the cell membrane in order to function properly. This project now seeks to understand exactly how Ras gets to and attaches to the cell membrane. Once we understand this mechanism drugs can be designed to block Ras getting to the membrane. Such drugs should neutralize the effect of Ras in tumours and control cell proliferation. In fact, our previous study has already led to the identification of the first generation of anti-Ras drugs that work on this principle."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof John Hancock","data":{"first_name":"John","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037089","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Hancock","source_individual_id":"RMIS11500","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof John Hancock"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86600","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1736","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Taurine Transporters and Brain Taurine Homeostasis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["brain","neurones","retina","taurine","transporters"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102448,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["brain development","epilepsy","macular degeneration","neurodegeneration"],"scientific_title":"Taurine Transporters and Brain Taurine Homeostasis","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Neurochemistry","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof David Pow","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102448","simplified_title":"Taurine Transporters in the Brain","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"226034.27","source_system":"Taurine is a very abundant amino acid in the brains of all mammals. Some animals such as cats gain almost all their taurine from their diet; others such as rats make significant amounts of taurine themselves; humans lie somewhere between these two extremes. Despite the variation in sources of taurine it has been standard practise for well over a decade to include taurine in human infant milk formulae because lack of dietary taurine in kittens leads to epileptic fits and abnormalities in brain development, whilst in adult cats death of cells such as photoreceptors (in the eye) is also observed. Despite these observations we have very little knowledge as to what taurine does in the brain because we have no selective drugs to examine the site or sites of taurine action. We hypothesise that taurine might mediate its actions by modifying the intracellular and extracellular levels of other neurotransmiters, especially glutamate. We plan to examine the brains and retinas of adult cats and kittens which have been given a diet deficient in taurine. We will determine the levels of each of the main neurotransmitters in the brain, both as global assays of whole tissues and at the cellular level by immunocytochemistry. We will examine whether there are any compensatory changes in levels of expression of taurine transporters as the body becomes depleted of taurine (since taurine content of nerve cells will be regulated by uptake of taurine in the absence of endogenous synthesis). Expression of glutamate transporters will also be examined. By understanding the way that the major neurotransmiter systems respond to a reduction in taurine levels we hope to generate both descriptive and predictive models that define the roles of taurine in the mammalian nervous system and which may give insights into mechanisms of significant human disease processes including epilepsy and a series of conditions involving degeneration of photoreceptors."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Pow","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021533","middle_name":"Vaughan","last_name":"Pow","source_individual_id":"RMIS4392155","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof David Pow"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82534","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1734","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A novel lipidic adjuvant carrier system for vaccination including vaccination via the oral route","data":{"media_summary":"Oral vaccination","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Adjuvant carrier system","Drug Delivery","Enhanced immunogenicity","Lipid-core-immunogen (LCI) system","Lipoamino acids"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102439,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Foot and Mouth Disease Virus","Group A Streptococcal Peptide Vaccine","Immunisation","Nisseria Meningitidis","Oral vaccination"],"scientific_title":"A novel lipidic adjuvant carrier system for vaccination including vaccination via the oral route","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Istvan TOTH","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102439","simplified_title":"A novel adjuvant for vaccination","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"214593.26","source_system":"We have developed a Lipid-Core-Peptide vaccine adjuvant system, based on the incorporation of lipoamino acids into poly-functional moiety that provides an excellent means for enhancing the antigenicity of a potential peptide-vaccine.

A library of spacer-lipoamino acid-poly-functional multiplier systems will be synthesised on solid phase. Model peptide epitopes will be synthesised on these different lipid-core systems and the antibody response will be compared with the response of the model peptide epitopes coupled to conventional vaccine carriers. The Lipid-Core Immunogen constructs including particulate systems will be administered orally as well, followed by measurement of the serum IgG response and the secretory IgA. This novel system can be used for any potential vaccine-peptide epitope and can open a new route to modern vaccination. The specific advantages of these kind of synthetic vaccines include the greater stability of the vaccine, reproducibility, eliminate the use of toxic conventional adjuvants. The key to this system is a novel carrier construct, which is non-toxic and not immunogenic. The system confers immunity with smaller risk of reaction, since it generates antibody production only against the infective microorganism. Vaccination via the oral route is highly desirable since it can overcome many of the disadvantages inherent in administration by injection - e.g. poor patient acceptability, requirement for skilled medical personnel, risk of HIV and other blood-borne diseases, restricted availability and, in cases, stimulation of the wrong type of immunity. Development of vaccines for oral administration will make them much more widely available, permitting self-administration by patients and markedly improving the operation of Public Health vaccination programs, particularly in developing countries."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Istvan Toth","data":{"first_name":"Istvan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034329","middle_name":"","last_name":"Toth","source_individual_id":"RMIS17214","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Istvan Toth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85883","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1732","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Adolescent depression: Evaluation of a preventive intervention and identification of risk factors","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["Adolescent depression","Cognitive-behaviour therapy","Prevention","Risk and protective factors","School-based interventions"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102431,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["Adolescent depression","Adolescent mental health","Prevention"],"scientific_title":"Adolescent depression: Evaluation of a preventive intervention and identification of risk factors","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Mental Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Susan Spence","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102431","simplified_title":"Prevention of adolescent depression and identification of risk factors","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"307313.33","source_system":"This project will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a school-based program to prevent depression among adolescents.

This project extends the current research program of the applicant. The intervention has already been developed and implemented with 1600 young people, with the support of local education authorities. The evaluation uses well-researched measures and includes a control group of adolescents who do not receive the intervention. Around 5% of adolescents experience clinical levels of depression and an even larger percentage show subclinical levels. Depression results in many debilitating consequences such as impaired school, work and social functioning and is also a risk factor in adolescent suicide. The prevention of mental health problems is a priority for Commonwealth and State governments and yet there is minimal research to demonstrate the effectiveness of preventive interventions, particularly in the area of depression. If the present study demonstrates a positive outcome, it will provide important guidelines as to preventive materials that should be included in the school curriculum. It is predicted that: a) the intervention will be associated with lower levels of depression over the 4 year follow-up, particularly for adolescents who are assessed as showing mild symptoms of depression, poor problem solving skills or pessimistic cognitive style prior to intervention b) risk factors for the development of depression in adolescents who do not receive the intervention will include initial mild symptoms of depression, poor problem solving skills and pessimistic attributional style."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Susan Spence","data":{"first_name":"Susan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022261","middle_name":"Hilary","last_name":"Spence","source_individual_id":"RMIS29798","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Susan Spence"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82741","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1731","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The plasmalemmal calcium pump and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["calcium","calcium pump","cellular signalling","pharmacology","signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":102426,"application_year":1999,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","smooth muscle proliferation","vascular smooth muscle"],"scientific_title":"The plasmalemmal calcium pump and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.","start_year":2000,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Gregory Monteith","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/102426","simplified_title":"A pump which removes calcium: is it important in the growth of smooth muscle?","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"179593.2","source_system":"Excessive growth of smooth muscle cells can lead to adverse effects in our arteries.

Although some cases are asymptomatic, Paget's disease is a major cause of bone pain and deformity. In Australia, 3-5% of people aged 40 years and over have Paget's disease. Paget's disease usually affects one of the long bones in the leg, the pelvic bone, the skull or the spine. One of the most serious complications of Paget's disease is the devlopment of bone cancer. A genetic predisposition is an important factor in the development of Paget's disease. At least a quarter of patients with Paget's disease have at least one close relative with the same condition.

We have identified a large family with over 200 members in which there are 35 subjects affected by Paget's disease.

The symptoms that people with MS develop can vary from one person to another, depending on where in the brain or spinal cord the lesions occur. Some parts of the brain and spinal cord seem to be much more susceptible to this attack than others, and the question that this study will address is why do lesions occur where they do in MS? Some preliminary results strongly suggest that there is a link between carrying particular genes that control immune responses, having immune cells that can attack one particular protein in the nervous system called PLP, and developing lesions in parts of the brain that control balance. This will be investigated further, and we will also look for other links between immune cells that can attack other proteins and development of lesions in particular areas. If such links can be identified, they would be very important for improved diagnosis of MS and it would enable more specific treatments for MS to be developed.

During the 1950's and 1960's, rates of coronary disease increased rapidly, then in the late 1960's they started to decline. This decrease has continued steadily for 30 years. While some other westernised countries have had this same experience, in Eastern Europe and in many developing countries coronary disease is increasing. There is a huge amount of evidence from experimental studies in animal and human subjects and population studies in many countries that the major determinants of coronary disease are high blood pressure, cigarette smoking and high cholesterol (and other lipids) as well as dietary factors, obesity and physical inactivity. Recently several large multicentre studies have found unexpectedly weaker associations between heart risk factors and disease rates. It is hypothesised that this is due to inappropriate analyses in which data from populations at different stages of the coronary epidemic have been combined.

From a public health perspective the most important outcome will be clarification of recent apparently anomalous findings about the importance of established risk factors and effective treatments in reducing coronary disease at the population level."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Annette Dobson","data":{"first_name":"Annette","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0036318","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Dobson","source_individual_id":"5011952","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Annette Dobson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86411","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1699","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of PMP-22 as an autoantigen in GBS 7 CIDP","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2001,"keywords":["NEUROPATHY","DEMYELINATION","AUTOIMMUNE","T LYMPHOCYTES"],"nhmrc_grant_id":8190,"application_year":1999,"start_year":2000,"scientific_title":"The role of PMP-22 as an autoantigen in GBS 7 CIDP","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"NEUROSCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Alice-Ann Sullivan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/8190","simplified_title":"The role of PMP-22 as an autoantigen in GBS 7 CIDP","sub_type":"Medical Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"44819.09","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Alice-Ann Sullivan","data":{"first_name":"Alice-Ann","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0010496","middle_name":"","last_name":"Sullivan","source_individual_id":"RMIS706201","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Alice-Ann Sullivan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79551","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1674","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Insulin sensitivity & signalling in human adipose tissue & skeletal muscle:Effects of tumour necrosis factor t","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["INSULLIN SIGNALLING","GLUCOSE UPTAKE","HUMAN ADIPOSE TISSUE","SKELETAL MUSCLE"],"nhmrc_grant_id":8177,"application_year":1999,"start_year":2001,"scientific_title":"Insulin sensitivity & signalling in human adipose tissue & skeletal muscle:Effects of tumour necrosis factor t","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Endocrinology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Trisha O'Moore-Sullivan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/8177","simplified_title":"Insulin sensitivity & signalling in human adipose tissue & skeletal muscle:Effects of tumour necrosis factor t","sub_type":"Medical Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"81937","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Trisha O'Moore-Sullivan","data":{"first_name":"Trisha","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0009456","middle_name":"M","last_name":"O'Moore-Sullivan","source_individual_id":"RMIS1218754","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Trisha O'Moore-Sullivan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79267","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1666","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Quantitation of echocardiographic assessment of regional myocardial function","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["NEW","CARDIAC","IMAGING"],"nhmrc_grant_id":8123,"application_year":1999,"start_year":2000,"scientific_title":"Quantitation of echocardiographic assessment of regional myocardial function","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cardiology (incl.
