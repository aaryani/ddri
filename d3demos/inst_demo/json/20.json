time remain unresponsive to, or tolerant of, self-antigens. A breakdown in the tolerance to self-antigens results in autoimmunity. Autoimmune disease includes more than 70 chronic disorders that affect about 1 in 20 people in the Western population. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie autoimmune disease is essential for the design of more successful treatments. The Lyn tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that is found within blood cells. It participates in transmitting information across the cell membrane to turn off cellular responses. Studies in mutant mice have shown that Lyn is critically important for maintaining stability in the immune system. Mice that are unable to make Lyn protein (Lyn-deficient mice) as well as mice that express an activated form of the Lyn enzyme (Lyn-up mice) develop autoimmune disease with characteristics similar to the human autoimmune disease systemic erythematosus (SLE). These studies suggest that Lyn is an important severity gene in autoimmunity. The aim of this grant will be to identify Lyn-dependent signaling pathways that lead to autoimmune disease, with a major focus being on the lipid kinase pathway. We will use a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to reveal critical genes and pathways. Cataloging the molecular changes related to alterations in Lyn activity will, we believe, provide insight into the genetic defects or signal perturbations underlying human autoimmune diseases. In this way, our study will aid in the diagnosis of human autoimmune diseases and uncover useful targets for more specific and effective treatments."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Tarlinton","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022451","middle_name":"Mathew","last_name":"Tarlinton","source_individual_id":"5017824","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Tarlinton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82786","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019597","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hibbs","source_individual_id":"5015236","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81986","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61156","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Validation of Stat3 as a therapeutic target in diseases arising from its inappropriate activation by gp130 cytokines","data":{"media_summary":"murine model","end_year":2010,"keywords":["cytokines","disease models animals","gastric cancer"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433617,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Interleukin 6 receptor","STAT signaling","cytokine signaling","gastric cancer","murine model"],"scientific_title":"Validation of Stat3 as a therapeutic target in diseases arising from its inappropriate activation by gp130 cytokines","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433617","simplified_title":"Stat3 and Gastric cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"674142.35","source_system":"Stomach cancer is the third most prevalent cancer in the Western World and result in the yearly death of several thousand people in Australia alone. We have discovered a specifice gene mutation of a receptor molecule called gp130 that results in the formation of stomach cancer in mice. We are now aiming to understand the exact molecular events by which this mutation results in the uncontrolled growth of stomach lining cells. We will employ a number of strategies to establish molecularly the extent to which this mouse model is informative for gastric cancer inhuman. In aprticular we will identify the genes that are involved in the progression of the disease. One important focus of the project is to see whether or not the moelcule (called Stat3) whose aberrant activation triggers the disease in the mouse could provide a future pharmacological target for intervention with the disease. Similarly with expertise of CIB, we will investigate with novel proteomics techniques whther we can identify a protein in the serum of these mice, which could give us aclue of whether or not the mouse ahs already developed disease. Such a protein could be of potentail diagnostic importance in the future to screen human for gastric cancer which in its eraly stages is usually without any clinical symptoms. In a related Aim we will find out the gene that can genetically cooperate with Stat3 and that is required to enable survival of newborn mice. It may well turn out mOur proposal combines the expertise of the two investigators in signal transduction and that this gene may be an important determinant to ensure that Stat3 triggers physiological rather than pathological responses in many differnet organs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Peter Hoffmann","data":{"first_name":"Peter","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007918","middle_name":"","last_name":"Hoffmann","source_individual_id":"5015285","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Peter Hoffmann"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78838","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61153","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Molecular identification of causative genetic and epigenetic alterations that induce and promote colorectal cancer","data":{"media_summary":"tumour progression","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Wnt signaling pathway including its modulators (Ecad, src)","colorectal cancer (CRC) and intestinal polyposis","conditional gene expression","epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation","myb and Stat transcriptionfactors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433616,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["colorectal cancer (CRC)","disease models animals","epigenetic modifications","not familial adenomatous polyposi","tumour progression"],"scientific_title":"Molecular identification of causative genetic and epigenetic alterations that induce and promote colorectal cancer","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433616","simplified_title":"mouse models for colon cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"381821","source_system":"The majority of mouse models currently employed to study colorectal cancer have two failings.

It is important to note that small intestinal cancers are in the minority of gastrointestinal cancers in humans. The second problem is that the genetic lesions introduced into mice are mostly in all cells throughout development. This is a poor representation of the random nature of genetic changes that underpin the probable cause of colon cancer. We therefore propose to genetically engineer unique mouse models that focus on colon cancer to most closely replicate the situation in human disease.

While early detection improves survival rate, nearly half of all CRC patients succumb to the disease within five years. In general, metastatic CRC is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and new therapies are required. An increased knowledge of the processes that contribute to the malignant state is likely to suggest new targets for treatment. CRC, like all cancer, is the result of genetic abnormalities (mutations) that are acquired over the course of a lifetime. Together the mutated genes produce changes in cell behaviour in processes such as growth, migration, angiogenesis (the ability to attract a blood supply) and cell death. All of these processes are active during normal development of a vertebrate organism, but are generally shutdown in the adult state, except in cancer. In this study we will analyse a group of genes that we have recently shown to be indispensable for normal intestinal development in zebrafish. Zebrafish are small tropical fish that are used frequently for genetic studies. They are very closely related to mammals and it has been shown that the genetic pathways that control the development of this animal are highly conserved in fish and mammals. Importantly, the genetic pathways that lead to cancer in humans are also strikingly similar in zebrafish. Our experiments will use mouse models to discover whether the zebrafish genes we have identified can lead to cancer when they are aberrantly expressed in the intestines of mice. Any genes that are found to contribute to the development of cancer in these models could become potential new targets for cancer therapy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham Lieschke","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038045","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Lieschke","source_individual_id":"5015985","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Graham Lieschke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86855","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joan Heath","data":{"first_name":"Joan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025417","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Heath","source_individual_id":"5015167","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joan Heath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83543","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61150","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of drug-loaded antibody-targeted nanoparticles to kill colorectal cancer cells","data":{"media_summary":"immunotherapy of cancer","end_year":2009,"keywords":["anti-cancer drugs","antibody","drug delivery","mouse models of metastasis","nanotechology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433613,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["colon cancer metastasis","colorectal cancer","colorectal cancer prevention and treatment","drug delivery system design","immunotherapy of cancer"],"scientific_title":"Development of drug-loaded antibody-targeted nanoparticles to kill colorectal cancer cells","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Therapies and Therapeutic Technology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Joan Heath","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433613","simplified_title":"Killing colorectal cancer cells with targeted drug-loaded nanoparticles","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"513146.74","source_system":"COLORECTAL CANCER (CRC) is the most common cancer in the Western world. In Australia, the five-year survival rate after surgical resection of the primary lesion is 55%, and for patients with advanced disease the five-year survival rate is less than 10%. Colorectal cancer is relatively resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and therefore there is great emphasis on identifying alternative modes of treatment. One approach that is attracting considerable attention is IMMUNOTHERAPY. In particular, the A33 ANTIBODY system appears to have the potential to target colorectal cancer cells and achieve therapeutic outcomes. The A33 system has been well characterised in both a clinical and laboratory setting over the last few years and recent clinical trials with humanised versions of the A33 antibody have demonstrated rapid localisation and accumulation of radiolabelled A33 to colorectal cancer lesions. The application of NANOTECHNOLOGY to biological systems is likely to transform the way we treat a variety of diseases over the course of the next decade. Nanosized drug delivery vehicles have the potential to revolutionise the treatment of a number of diseases, cancer in particular. Hollow capsules can be synthesised with a drug sequestered inside the capsule, where the capsule wall performs a dual role of protecting the body from potentially harmful side effects of the drug, as well as protecting the drug from being degraded by the body. We plan to use these nanosized drug carriers, functionalised with the A33 antibody, to deliver chemotherapy agents directly to the colorectal cancer cells. We have recently demonstrated that in vitro, nanocapsules functionalised with the A33 antibody specifically bind to CRC cells, and once bound, the capsules are internalised. In this proposal we will test the ability of these particles to kill CRC cells in mice harbouring human tumours."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Edouard Nice","data":{"first_name":"Edouard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027033","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Nice","source_individual_id":"RMIS452792","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Edouard Nice"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83994","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joan Heath","data":{"first_name":"Joan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025417","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Heath","source_individual_id":"5015167","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joan Heath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83543","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Frank Caruso","data":{"first_name":"Frank","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012202","middle_name":"","last_name":"Caruso","source_individual_id":"RMIS4471339","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Frank Caruso"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80001","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61149","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Systematically exploring the contribution of immunoproteasome to immunodominance and T cell function","data":{"media_summary":"vaccine development","end_year":2009,"keywords":["T cell immunity","antigen presentation","immunologic memory","proteasome","viral immunity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433608,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["T cell immunity","T lymphocyte responses","anti-viral development","antiviral immunity","vaccine development"],"scientific_title":"Systematically exploring the contribution of immunoproteasome to immunodominance and T cell function","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Weisan Chen","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433608","simplified_title":"Immunoproteasome and immunodominance","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"499860.05","source_system":"Vaccine will help us to fight both infectious diseases and malignancy. However, there are few successful vaccines for infectious agents and there is simply no vaccine to cure any tumor at the moment. So, it is essential for us to learn the basics related to vaccine development. Killer T cells eliminate tumour cells or virally infected host cells by recognising fragments (epitopes) derived from tumour- or virus-derived proteins displayed on a host molecule called MHC. Normally multiple epitopes are generated as part of the protein recycling program referred as proteine degradation which is mainly conducted by bundled enzyme complex, called proteasome. Two major forms of proteasomes are expressed by most cells. One called house-keeping proteasome and the other, which replaces the house-keeping one during viral infections is called immunoproteasome. The role that the immunoproteasome plays during anti-viral and anti-tumoral immune responses is not fully understood. In addition, the immunoproteasome is also expressed by a few cell types that do not suppose to need it if its function is entirely to generate better epitopes for MHC to display. In this project, we will sytematically explore the contribution of the immunoproteasome to overall anti-viral and anti-tumoral immune responses in three mouse model systems. The shared feature of these systems is that multiple killer T cell epitopes have been defined, which could potentially provide us with very sensitive assessments. The three systems are anti-influenza, anti-vaccinia virus and anti-tumor antigen (NY-ESO-1) mouse models."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Weisan Chen","data":{"first_name":"Weisan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0018204","middle_name":"","last_name":"Chen","source_individual_id":"RMIS676841","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Weisan Chen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81659","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61148","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["colon cancer mechanisms;

Improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie these diseases is essential for the design of more effective treatments. Lyn and SHIP-1 are enzymes that are found in blood cells, and both participate in terminating cellular responses. As such, these enzymes are critically important for maintaining stability in the immune system. While these enzymes have unique roles, we also have good evidence that in some instances Lyn and SHIP-1 participate in the same biochemical pathway. We have created mice that are unable to make Lyn protein, and have found that these mice develop blood cell tumours. Mice lacking SHIP-1 develop a number of haematological defects, but die at a young age due to an inflammatory lung condition, making an assessment of the role of SHIP-1 in age-dependent tumour development difficult. We now wish to study the role of SHIP-1 in tumour development, by generating mice that lack SHIP-1 in specific white blood cell compartments. We are also investigating how SHIP-1 and Lyn cooperate in tumour suppression, and we have recently generated mice that simultaneously lack both SHIP-1 and Lyn. Preliminary studies indicate that compound mutant mice develop multiple haematological malignancies. We will fully characterize tumour development in these animals, and determine the molecular basis for this pathology. We will focus on two pathways that have been previously implicated in oncogenesis. These studies will improve our insight into how Lyn and SHIP-1 cooperate in blood cell development, cellular homeostasis and oncogenesis, and add to our biological and biochemical understanding of tumour suppressor networks."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019597","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hibbs","source_individual_id":"5015236","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81986","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6950","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of an Anti-GM-CSF Antibody for Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["Anti-inflammatory","Clinical research","Immunodiagnostic technique","Monoclonal antibody","Rheumatoid arthritis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":381407,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2006,"scientific_title":"Development of an Anti-GM-CSF Antibody for Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rheumatology and Arthritis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew Scott","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/381407","simplified_title":"Development of an Antibody for Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"283000","source_system":"The aim of this project is to develop assays for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of an anti-GMCSF neutralizing antibody in a Australian first-in-man clinical trial in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

cancer is the third most prevalent cancer in the Western World and result in the yearly death of several thousand people in Australia alone. We have discovered a specifice gene mutation of a receptor molecule called gp130 that results in the formation of stomach cancer in mice. We are now aiming to understand the exact molecular events by which this mutation results in the uncontrolled growth of stomach mining cells. Our proposal combines the expertise of the two investigators in signal transduction and the making of genetically modified mouse models. These strategies will be employed to specifically address in the laboratory mouse the function of two specififc signaling cascades, called Stat3 and TGF-beta. The identification of detailed description by which these molecules causally relate to cancer formation will provide clear and specific molecular targets for future therapies to treat various cancers, including those of the stomach."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Hong-Jian Zhu","data":{"first_name":"Hong-Jian","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005673","middle_name":"","last_name":"Zhu","source_individual_id":"5018579","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Hong-Jian Zhu"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78249","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5954","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Gastrointestinal cancer","Molecular genetics","Signal transduction"],"nhmrc_grant_id":331004,"application_year":2004,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/331004","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"595500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5953","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of a novel biosensor using magnetically amplified luminescence for the early detection of cancer","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Biotechnology","Cancer Detection","Diagnostic Techniques"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280927,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Development of a novel biosensor using magnetically amplified luminescence for the early detection of cancer","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Diagnostic Applications","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"BIOTECHNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Edouard Nice","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280927","simplified_title":"A new biosensor method for the early detection of cancer","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"267500","source_system":"Cancer is often not detected until it has invaded surrounding tissues and spread to other organs.

These messages tell the cells to grow, divide or die. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is linked to a variety of cell signalling pathways that are critical to the normal functioning of cells. Conversely, abberations in Epidermal Growth Factor-mediated cell signalling leads to many types of cancers. A basic understanding of how the receptor is turned off or on is essential to designing drugs that can specifically inhibit its hyperproliferative response. High resolution structures of a key part of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor have identified several structural forms of the receptor that are providing valuable clues as to the structural basis for receptor activation. Armed with this information and advanced microscopic imaging technology we are in the unique position to probe receptor activation in living cells. This project seeks to determine which structural form of the receptor is responsible for transmission of cellular messages and how it is impaired in cancerous cells."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Edouard Nice","data":{"first_name":"Edouard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027033","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Nice","source_individual_id":"RMIS452792","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Edouard Nice"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83994","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Andrew Clayton","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0006618","middle_name":"Harry","last_name":"Clayton","source_individual_id":"5013986","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Andrew Clayton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78500","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5060","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Identification of genes regulating vertebrate intestinal development","data":{"media_summary":"intestinal diseases","end_year":2006,"keywords":["development","genetics","intestine","positional cloning","zebrafish"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280916,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["cell growth/differentiation","colon biology","colon cancer mechanisms","colorectal cancer (CRC)","intestinal diseases"],"scientific_title":"Identification of genes regulating vertebrate intestinal development","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Genetic Development (incl.

While early detection improves survival rate, nearly half of all CRC patients succumb to the disease within five years. In general, metastatic CRC is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and new therapies are required. An increased knowledge of the processes that contribute to the malignant state is likely to suggest new targets for treatment. CRC, like all cancer, is the result of genetic abnormalities (mutations) that are acquired over the course of a lifetime. Together the mutated genes produce changes in cell behaviour in processes such as growth, migration, angiogenesis (the ability to attract a blood supply) and cell death. All of these processes are active during normal development of a vertebrate organism, but are generally shutdown in the adult state, except in cancer. In this study, we propose to identify a set of genes that control the development of the intestine in a small tropical fish, the zebrafish. Zebrafish are vertebrate organisms, closely related to mice and man. Essentially all the pathways regulating development are conserved in the three species. The zebrafish offers several advantages: they are small, easy to breed, cheap to maintain and, most importantly, their embryos are transparent, making it possible to visualise development in live embryos in a simple microscope. Our project will use a panel of mutant strains of zebrafish that have an array of visible abnormalities in intestinal development. The abnormalities were induced using a chemical that produces single base pair changes in DNA. An established technique called positional cloning will allow us to identify the genes in which the mutations have been introduced, and provide a genetic explanation for the intestinal abnormalities. Upon identification of the mutated genes, our ultimate aim will be to test whether they also play a role in the development of CRC, using mouse models and human tissues."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham

Furthermore, the presence of blood vessels in a tumor enables tumor cells to enter the bloodstream and spread to distant parts of the body - a process known as metastatis that is the major cause of death in cancer patients. The growth of blood vessels - angiogenesis - is the mechanism by which tumors attract the vasculature. The capacity to block tumor angiogenesis would be of great benefit in the clinic as it would restrict both the growth and spread of tumors. Tumor cells attract blood vessels by secreting angiogenic growth factors that stimulate the proliferation of endothelial cells - the cells that form the inner lining of blood vessels. These Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGFs) are proteins. One VEGF, namely VEGF-D, was discovered in our laboratory at the Melbourne Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. VEGF-D stimulates the growth of blood vessels and possibly lymphatic vessels and is present in the most common human cancers including malignant melanoma and cancer of the breast and lung. We hypothesize that angiogenesis in some tumors is dependent on VEGF-D. Moreover, VEGF-D secreted by tumor cells may stimulate growth of lymphatic vessels - lymphangiogenesis. As metastatic spread often occurs via the lymphatic vessels, tumor lymphangiogenesis induced by VEGF-D may contribute to metastasis. The purpose of the research project is to determine the role of VEGF-D in tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Firstly we will thoroughly characterize the localization of VEGF-D in human cancer. Secondly, we will test VEGF-D for lymphangiogenic activity. Thirdly, the growth and metastatic spread in mice of tumors overexpressing VEGF-D will be analysed. Finally, aspects of VEGF-D biochemistry and gene regulation will be studied to develop strategies for inhibition of VEGF-D action in cancer."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Marc Achen","data":{"first_name":"Marc","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005712","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Achen","source_individual_id":"RMIS221898","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Marc Achen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78261","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Steven Stacker","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004787","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Stacker","source_individual_id":"RMIS228227","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Steven Stacker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77998","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2867","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The role of RYK and Eph receptors in developmental and tumour angiogenesis","data":{"media_summary":"Pro-angiogenesis therapy","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Angiogenesis and/or tumour angiogenesis","Developmental genetics","Growth factor receptor signalling","Receptor complexes and signalling pathways","Receptor crosstalk"],"nhmrc_grant_id":164801,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Anti-angiogenesis therapy","Cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease","Diabetic retinopathy","Primary and metastatic tumours","Pro-angiogenesis therapy"],"scientific_title":"The role of RYK and Eph receptors in developmental and tumour angiogenesis","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Steven Stacker","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/164801","simplified_title":"Receptors involved in the formation of blood vessels","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"The formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) is a key process in development of the embryo, wound healing, tumour formation-metastases and in the re-vascularisation of ischeamic limbs.

In general belong to a family of molecules called growth factors and theri associated receptor present on the surface of a cell. These molecules can control the number, location and function of specific blood vessels within the body. Recently we have discoverd new members of a family of growth fcators called vascular endothelial growth factors, and demonstrated their ability to promote the growth of blood and lymphatic vessels. In this study we set out to examine the role of another family of growth factor receptors, called RYK (for which we have a granted patent in the USA and Australia) in angiogenesis. functional experiments in mice have demonstrated that RYK can associated with a family of receptors called Eph receptors which play a key role in the remodelling of blood vessels during development and injury. Studying these molecules may tell us why blood vessels know' to be in the correct locations in the body and why in certain disease we see vessels of incorrect structure or location. These studies will form a basis of knowledge to develop rational means to manipulate blood vessel formation in the body, using non-surgical methods. The work will also have application to the areas of cleft palate, craniofacial abnormalities and axon pathfinding."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Christopher Hovens","data":{"first_name":"Christopher","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019716","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Hovens","source_individual_id":"5011496","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Christopher Hovens"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82024","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Marc Achen","data":{"first_name":"Marc","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005712","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Achen","source_individual_id":"RMIS221898","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Marc Achen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78261","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Steven Stacker","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004787","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Stacker","source_individual_id":"RMIS228227","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Steven Stacker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77998","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2868","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Analysis of APC and APC protein complexes in colon cancer","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["APC mutant mouse models","APC protein complexes","colon cancer","gastrointestinal disease","tumour progression"],"nhmrc_grant_id":164802,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["FAP familial adenomatous polyposis","colon cancer","desmoid tumours"],"scientific_title":"Analysis of APC and APC protein complexes in colon cancer","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Maree Faux","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/164802","simplified_title":"Role of the tumour suppressor APC in colon cancer","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"110786.72","source_system":"Colorectal cancer is one of the foremost causes of death in Australia.

Conservative estimates (Australian Crohn's and Colitis Association) suggest that at least 23,000 Australians are affected (>1 in 1000). Ten years after onset, there is an estimated risk of 0.5-1.0% per year of pancolitis patients developing full-blown bowel cancer. Current therapies for colon cancer are not very effective and the median survival for patients with metastatic disease is poor at 7-12 months. It is therefore important to increase our understanding of the biology underlying these inflammatory conditions so that more effective treatments may be developed and fewer patients proceed to the cancerous stage. We have recently demonstrated a novel interaction between two proteins that may be relevant to intestinal inflammation. Surprisingly, the two proteins would not normally be expected to coincide with each other because of their different localisations within cells and tissues. The first protein, Cdx2, is only synthesised by intestinal lining cells and normally resides in the nucleus where it activates genes that play a role in the highly specialised absorptive functions of the intestine. The other protein, acrogranin-granulin, is more widely distributed in the body and is generally transported out of cells shortly after it has been made. It has been shown to interact with receptors on epithelial cells and blood cells and promotes their growth. In this proposal we will be investigating whether the complex formed between Cdx2 and granulin is important for normal physiology. Moreover since elevated levels of granulin are associated with inflammation, we aim to determine whether the Cdx2-granulin complex is formed during the active phase of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the Cdx2-granulin complex plays an important role in repairing the damage caused to the lining of the intestine during inflammation."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joan Heath","data":{"first_name":"Joan","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0025417","middle_name":"K","last_name":"Heath","source_individual_id":"5015167","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Joan Heath"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83543","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2870","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the management of glioma, head and neck and other cancers","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["EGF/EGFR signalling","cancer therapy","cytosensor analysis","small molecule inhibitors"],"nhmrc_grant_id":164809,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["cancer","colonic carcinoma","glioblastoma","squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck"],"scientific_title":"Development of novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the management of glioma, head and neck and other cancers","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Edouard Nice","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/164809","simplified_title":"Novel small molecule inhibitors for cancer treatment","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"196527.54","source_system":"Abnormalities in EGF-EGFR family signalling pathways have been implicated in many human cancers including glioma, squamous cell carcinome of the head and neck, colon, ovary and prostate, and are associated with poor clinical prognosis, non-responsiveness to chemotherapy, and decreased survival.

This proposal outlines experiments aimed at understanding the role of the individual EGFR family members in controlling a complex signalling network, and the development of novel small molecule inhibitors of these pathways which are specific for individual EGFR family members and which should prove effective in the management of many forms of cancer. Additionally, the potential synergy of these inhibitors in combination therapy with other anti-cancer drugs and reagents which induce cell death will be investigated. These small molecule pharmaceuticals could easily be produced commercially, and taken into clinical trials, in Australia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Antony Burgess","data":{"first_name":"Antony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029685","middle_name":"W","last_name":"Burgess","source_individual_id":"5013679","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Antony Burgess"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84686","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Edouard Nice","data":{"first_name":"Edouard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0027033","middle_name":"C","last_name":"Nice","source_individual_id":"RMIS452792","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Edouard Nice"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83994","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Francesca Walker","data":{"first_name":"Francesca","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016897","middle_name":"","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"5019366","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Francesca Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81296","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2872","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Specificity of Smad Proteins in Transforming Growth Factor-beta Signaling","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Molecular mechanism and determinants","Smad signaling specificity","Spatial distribution of signaling complexes","TGF-beta and cancer","TGF-beta signaling specificity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":164812,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Colorectal and pancreatic cancers","Head and neck, breast, prostatic cancers","Inflammatory dieases"],"scientific_title":"Specificity of Smad Proteins in Transforming Growth Factor-beta Signaling","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Hong-Jian Zhu","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/164812","simplified_title":"Smad Protein Action in Transforming Growth Factor-beta Biological Function","sub_type":"New Investigator Grant","total_budget":"212036.72","source_system":"Transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-beta) regulate a fascinating array of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, organization and death, as well as affect a wide range of biological functions, such as embryonic development, hematopoiesis and immune and inflammatory responses.

Therefore, the proper functioning of this system is critical for the normal development and maintenance of most tissues. Dysregulation of this system is implicated in many pathological conditions, including cancer. The actions of TGF-beta are mediated by three cell surface proteins, termed the type I, II and III TGF-beta receptors. The type I and II receptors are required for transmitting the TGF-beta signal to the nucleus of the cell. Existing data suggest that the type III receptor is not required in TGF-beta signaling but is required for the regulation of TGF-beta levels at the cell surface. However, the function of this receptor and its role in TGF-beta mediated regulation of cell growth and survival is poorly understood. Our earlier work indicated that the TGF-beta type III receptor is particularly important for limiting TGF-beta activity during normal liver development. The currently proposed research will examine the effects of type III receptor deficiency on liver cells in the adult mouse in order to determine whether alterations in cell growth and survival occur in the absence of this receptor. Becauses TGF-beta is a key regulator of liver growth and altered levels of TGF-beta in liver have been demonstrated to lead to liver cancer in mice, we anticipate that targeting the deletion of the type III gene to liver cells will provide a system in which to study compromised regulation of cell growth. This work is therefore expected to yield information relevant to the role of this receptor in TGF-beta regulated processes in normal and cancerous growth. Because the type III receptor appears to control the level of TGF-beta activity, this work will allow further evaluation of the potential for therapeutic uses for type III receptor-like agents."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ashley Dunn","data":{"first_name":"Ashley","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0042152","middle_name":"","last_name":"Dunn","source_individual_id":"RMIS82651","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ashley Dunn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87928","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Kaye Stenvers","data":{"first_name":"Kaye","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0004815","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Stenvers","source_individual_id":"RMIS102633","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Kaye Stenvers"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78005","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2875","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Developmental stages of in vivo and in vitro-generated dendritic cell subsets and regulation of T cell differentiation.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2002,"keywords":["T cell cytokine regulation","dendritic cells","maturation and activation","subsets"],"nhmrc_grant_id":164816,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["cancer","immunotherapy","vaccination immunology"],"scientific_title":"Developmental stages of in vivo and in vitro-generated dendritic cell subsets and regulation of T cell differentiation.","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cellular Immunology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Eugene Maraskovsky","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/164816","simplified_title":"How DC subsets differ, how their developmental stages influence the types of cytokines and functions of T cells.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"88087.21","source_system":"Dendritic cells (DC) represent a diverse family of white blood cells that form a sentinel network throughout the body involved in the detection and eradication of pathogens and cancer cells. DC can originate from different precursor cells in the bone marrow. It is therefore possible that different types of DC perform differing functions. For instance, DC not only initiate immune responses but are also able to silence them. However, the ability of DC to instruct and orchestrate the immune response may not only depend upon their origins but also on where they encounter pathogens or cancer cells and what other signals are associated with this encounter. Due to their specialized capacity to instruct the immune response (e.g. T cells, B cells and NK cells) of impending danger, DC are used experimentally to more efficiently deliver vaccines to the immune response so as to eradicate cancer or infectious disease. However, in order to successfully use DC to deliver vaccines, one must first understand how these cells normally behave in the body and what signals can alter their functional ability to orchestrate immune responses. We can generate DC outside the body from their precursors. We can also isolate DC from the circulation. This project seeks to identify how various physiologic stimuli differentially regulate the functional behaviour of DC subsets and how this then influences the DC's ability to instruct the developing T cell immune response. Furthermore, whether these signals are the same for DC generated outside the body with those isolated from the blood. Of particular interest is whether differing types of DC and differing stages of their maturity will differentially influence the T cell's ability to secrete immune response hormones and to recognize and kill cancer cells. The findings of this study have direct implications of how to best harness DC to effectively deliver vaccines and generate potent immune responses against cancer and infectious disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Eugene Maraskovsky","data":{"first_name":"Eugene","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0008878","middle_name":"","last_name":"Maraskovsky","source_individual_id":"RMIS72301","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Eugene Maraskovsky"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79105","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jonathan Cebon","data":{"first_name":"Jonathan","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0006468","middle_name":"","last_name":"Cebon","source_individual_id":"5013850","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jonathan Cebon"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78457","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2876","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Cell cycle regulation by the Epidermal Growth factor receptor","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["anti-cancer agents","apoptosis","growth factor control of proliferation and apoptosis","regulation of transcription","signal transduction pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":164817,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["brain tumors","cancer treatment","colon cancer","psoriasis"],"scientific_title":"Cell cycle regulation by the Epidermal Growth factor receptor","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

This research is aimed at understanding how genes which are altered in colon cancer influence the growth of cells in normal intestine.

Mutations in a number of genes (known as APC, beta-catenin, Kirsten-ras, p53, SMAD2, SMAD4) are commonly found in colorectal tumours. Moreover, some of the mutations are highly associated with distinct stages of colon tumour development. As yet, however, we have no real insights into how these mutations cooperate with each other to produce full-blown (malignant) colorectal cancer. In our proposal, we are aiming to establish colorectal cancer in mice. Our approach will be to progressively introduce mutant genes into intestinal epithelial cells (singly and in combination) and study how they cooperate with each other to produce benign, and ultimately, malignant tumours in the intestines of mice. This will help us to understand which mutant genes are required for each stage in tumour development and may provide more rational approaches to bowel cancer screening and treatment."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Joan

Improving our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie autoimmune disease is essential for the design of more effective treatments. The Lyn tyrosine kinase is a member of a family of genes that participate in transmitting information across the cell membrane. This enzyme is expressed in blood cells, and is involved in mechanisms pertaining to infection, immunity and allergic responses. To further our understanding of the role of this enzyme in the context of the whole animal, we have generated two strains of mice, one that is unable to make Lyn (Lyn-deficient mice) and one that expresses an activated form of the Lyn enzyme (Lyn-up mice). We have found that both strains of mice develop autoimmune disease with characteristics similar to the human autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These studies suggest that Lyn is an important severity gene in autoimmunity. In this study we will examine in detail the role that Lyn plays in B cell development, function and autoimmunity, and we intend to identify the pathways that lead to autoimmune disease in Lyn mutant mice. On completion of these studies we will have developed a catalogue of the molecules and pathways perturbed in Lyn mutant mice.

Currently there are no molecular markers that can predict who will get severe asthma and there are no specific treatments to reverse severe exacerbations. This project will use advanced molecular biology methods to examine whether a molecule called Lyn may be important.

Their favourable attributes include their reproductive biology, the optical clarity of embryos, and the accessibility of embryos for experimental procedures. Previous studies overseas have recovered over 1500 strains of zebrafish with inherited diseases due to induced mutations in about 500 genes. Many of these zebrafish have abnormalities of unexpected precision and are leading to new genes with novel specialized functions. About 50 mutant zebrafish strains exist in which red blood cell development is perturbed - this was easily recognized because the transparency of embryos enabled lack of blood be easily seen. Our new studies aim primarily to recover mutant zebrafish with disorders of white blood cell formation. We have identified methods to recognize failure of white blood cell formation in zebrafish, and will employ these methods to look for inherited disorders that specifically affect white blood cell development in a process called genetic screening. Fish with different sets of randomly mutated genes will be systematically screened to identify those with abnormal white blood cell development. We have tested our approach and identified several mutants affecting white blood cell development. Once these new strains of fish are identified, we will find the genetic lesion responsible for the abnormality in several of the most interesting strains by gene mapping and positional cloning. Hence, the mutant zebrafish identified in the screen will eventually lead to the discovery of new genes important in white blood cell growth and development. The fish themselves will provide insights into the causes of congenital diseases of white blood cells. Since many genes involved in early development are also important in cancer, we believe that newly identified genes will also help understand the causes of abnormal growth of white blood cells in leukaemia."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham Lieschke","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038045","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Lieschke","source_individual_id":"5015985","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Graham Lieschke"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86855","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Judith Layton","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0031991","middle_name":"E","last_name":"Layton","source_individual_id":"RMIS85280","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Judith Layton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85273","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4184","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Therapeutic Strategies in Epithelial Cancer Through Signalling Inhibition of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.","data":{"media_summary":"radiotherapy of cancer","end_year":2003,"keywords":["DNA repair","EGF/EGFR signalling","animal model","proteomics","tumour immunotherapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":234709,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["disease model, cancer","epithelial neoplasms, malignant","growth factors / receptors","proteomics","radiotherapy of cancer"],"scientific_title":"Therapeutic Strategies in Epithelial Cancer Through Signalling Inhibition of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Oncology and Carcinogenesis","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Andrew Scott","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/234709","simplified_title":"Cancer Therapy by Inhibition of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"136250","source_system":"The growth of cancer cells is regulated by many factors, including the presence of growth receptors on the surface of cancer cells.

We are developing a number of potential therapeutic compounds that act by inhibiting the EGFR in cancer cells. These compounds include a novel monoclonal antibody that binds to EGFR and inhibits its function, and a small molecule that binds to a portion of the EGFR inside cancer cells and also inhibits function. Both of these compounds prevent tumour growth in laboratory studies. This project will examine the mechanisms of action of these compounds, and explore ways to improve their anti-cancer effect.

Using a range of sophisticated detection methods, very early memory T cells will be identified in the primary response and tracked through their differentiation into long-term memory pool. Experiments will determine how T cells against particular determinants are selected from the primary immune response, retained in the memory pool and recalled in the subsequent challenges. The properties of antigen processing of various determinants will be correlated with the immunodominance hierarchy in the primary and memory response.

have already made important discoveries about the molecular control of the lymphatic system in normal physiology and cancer. The lymphatic vasculature consists of a network of vessels in organs and tissues that is critical for the regulation of tissue fluid volume and immune function. The lymphatics are also important for the metastatic spread of cancer, as they provide a route by which tumour cells spread to distant sites in the body, and for lymphedema, a condition in which lymphatic dysfunction leads to swelling of tissues. This program will explore the molecular mechanisms that control the growth and differentiation of the lymphatic vessels. It will greatly enhance our understanding of lymphatic vessel growth (lymphangiogenesis) and generate a range of reagents for stimulating or inhibiting this process. These reagents will be tested in animal models for their capacity to modulate lymphatic function in the context of cancer and lymphedema."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Marc Achen","data":{"first_name":"Marc","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005712","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Achen","source_individual_id":"RMIS221898","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Marc Achen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78261","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Steven Stacker","data":{"first_name":"Steven","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004787","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Stacker","source_individual_id":"RMIS228227","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Steven Stacker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77998","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5052","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"An analysis of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in the regulation of hematopoiesis and tumourigenesis.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Hematopoiesis","Immune system disorders","Lyn tyrosine kinase","Signal transduction","Tumour suppression/promotion"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280902,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Chronic myeloid leukemia","Hematology"],"scientific_title":"An analysis of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in the regulation of hematopoiesis and tumourigenesis.","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"Dr Kenneth Harder","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280902","simplified_title":"Use of Lyn mutant mice to study the role of Lyn in regulation of blood cell development and cancer.","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"381000","source_system":"The Lyn kinase is an enzyme that is involved in relaying information across the cell membrane. It is a member of a family of genes that have been implicated in tumour development. Lyn is expressed in blood cells and it is involved in a variety of immunological responses. To further our understanding of the role of this enzyme in the context of the whole animal, we have generated two strains of mice, one that is unable to make Lyn protein (Lyn-deficient mice) and one that expresses an activated form of the Lyn enzyme (Lyn-up mice). Our previous studies have shown that Lyn-deficient mice have enhanced blood cell formation (hematopoiesis) and develop white blood cell tumours with age, whereas Lyn-up mice show no propensity to develop tumours. In this study we will examine in detail the role that Lyn plays in blood cell formation and tumourigenesis, and we will identify the pathways that underlie the phenotypes in Lyn-deficient mice. On completion of these studies we will have catalogued the molecules and pathways regulated by Lyn, and have an understanding of how Lyn functions in regulating development of specific populations of blood cells, and in suppressing or promoting tumour development."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019597","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hibbs","source_individual_id":"5015236","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81986","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Kenneth Harder","data":{"first_name":"Kenneth","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0013502","middle_name":"","last_name":"Harder","source_individual_id":"RMIS1693984","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Kenneth Harder"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80349","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5053","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Cardiovascular system"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280903,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Marc Achen","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280903","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"602500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Marc Achen","data":{"first_name":"Marc","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0005712","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Achen","source_individual_id":"RMIS221898","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Marc Achen"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78261","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5054","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["lyn tyrosine kinase","mouse models","signal transduction","signaling pathways"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280905,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Autoimmunity","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Research Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280905","simplified_title":"Uncoupled Research Fellowship","sub_type":"Research Fellowship","total_budget":"639500","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs","data":{"first_name":"Margaret","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0019597","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Hibbs","source_individual_id":"5015236","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Margaret Hibbs"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81986","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5055","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Genetic dissection of the function of the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck in inflammatory lung disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Chronic pulmonary inflammation","Conditional gene targeting","Innate immunity","Proteomics","SRC family tyrosine kinase"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280910,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Asthma","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)","Eosinophilic pneumonitis","Fibrosis"],"scientific_title":"Genetic dissection of the function of the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck in inflammatory lung disease","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Respiratory Diseases","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280910","simplified_title":"Regulation of inflammatory lung disease by the enzyme Hck","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"323750","source_system":"This project aims to identify better and safer treatments for serious, life-threatening inflammatory lung diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD), which affect over 600 million people worldwide and are a major health problem in Australia. There are no effective treatments that can reverse or slow these diseases. The research is based on our recent discovery that an enzyme called Hck might play a very important role in lung disease. We used mice in which a genetic method had been used to change Hck into its active form. The mice appeared normal when they were born but developed a progressive lung inflammation that resembled serious human lung diseases. Surprisingly, the mice also displayed enhanced responses to substances from bacteria that can infect the lung - a so-called innate immune response. This led us to conclude that the main problem in the mice was actually enhanced innate immunity - which is usually protective - turning against the lung to cause disease. To understand exactly what controls this fine balance between protection and lung damage, we will use new and sophisticated gene modification methods that allow us to target changes in Hck activity to specific cells that we suspect are the main cause of the disease. In doing so we will add special tags into these cells, so that we can isolate the controlling molecules in the disease process. We are particularly interested in a cell called the macrophage, a major defensive cell in the lung that is also known to be capable of causing lung disease. Our aim is to find disease-controlling molecules that could be blocked with new drugs that would suppress disease but spare defenses against lung infections."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst","data":{"first_name":"Matthias","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0018887","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Ernst","source_individual_id":"5014537","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Matthias Ernst"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81836","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Gary Anderson","data":{"first_name":"Gary","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0005805","middle_name":"P","last_name":"Anderson","source_individual_id":"RMIS168037","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Gary Anderson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78284","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5056","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Colon Cancer: Receptors, Signalling and Therapeutics","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["APC protein complexes","Antibody","Colon Cancer","Epidermal growth factor receptor","Tumout suppressor"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280912,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Colon Cancer: Receptors, Signalling and Therapeutics","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Biochemistry: Proteins and Peptides","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND CLINICAL CHEMISTRY","cia_name":"Prof Antony Burgess","higher_grant_type":"Programs","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280912","simplified_title":"Colon Cancer: Developing New Therapies","sub_type":"Program Grant","total_budget":"7115542.5","source_system":"This program aims to understand the biochemical and biological basis of colorectal cancer, a major cause of cancer deaths in Australia.
