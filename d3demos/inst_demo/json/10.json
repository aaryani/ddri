We aim to identify regions of the protein that generate antibodies that prevent malaria parasites from invading human cells and help in the search for a vaccine against malaria."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Andrew Coley","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0030037","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Coley","source_individual_id":"5013999","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Andrew Coley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84785","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Foley","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007304","middle_name":"","last_name":"Foley","source_individual_id":"RMIS522146","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Foley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78669","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62389","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Acceptance and commitment therapy for medication-resistant psychosis: a randomised controlled trial","data":{"media_summary":"schizophrenia","end_year":2012,"keywords":["cognitive behaviour","mental health","psychosis","randomised controlled trial","schizophrenia"],"nhmrc_grant_id":487335,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["acceptance and commitment therapy","negative symptoms","psychological treatment","psychosis","schizophrenia"],"scientific_title":"Acceptance and commitment therapy for medication-resistant psychosis: a randomised controlled trial","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Psychiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr John Farhall","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/487335","simplified_title":"Evaluating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy as a psychological treatment for schizophrenia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"558200.5","source_system":"In spite of advances in medication, approximately one third of people with schizophrenia continue to experience distressing symptoms such as hearing voices and paranoia.

Following diagnosis of MCI, active management through symptomatic drug treatment remains equivocal, therefore, memory impairment continues to be troublesome and patients and families are seeking interventions that offer improvement in quality of life. Cognitive interventions are low cost and, where effective, can provide a stand-alone intervention or add value to the pharmacological approach. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether an early intervention program of memory training is effective in improving use of memory strategies in everyday life, and whether this has psychological and emotional benefits for individuals with MCI and their families. We will evaluate through a randomised controlled trial the efficacy of a memory-group program which will involve the family and patient, rather than just the person with MCI, in developing increased awareness of memory issues and specific strategies to prevent memory failures. Over successive cohorts recruited from memory clinics, families will be randomly assigned to either an immediate intervention or a delayed intervention (waiting-list control) group. We will also recruit a sample of healthy older adults who will be similarly randomised into early and late intervention groups. Healthy older adults will provide a means of establishing whether any improvements in the MCI groups are (i) to the same extent as healthy older adults and (ii) to normative levels. Evaluation will be at pre- and post-intervention and at six months follow-up on tests of memory, questionnaires of knowledge and use of memory strategies in everyday life, and appraisal of level of wellbeing. Information about memory and systematic training in compensatory memory skills are expected to significantly improve the capacity of patients and families to cope with everyday memory difficulties. Through active participation in the management of memory impairment, it is expected that the level of wellbeing will increase, for both patient and families."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Ben Ong","data":{"first_name":"Ben","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038893","middle_name":"","last_name":"Ong","source_individual_id":"5016817","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Ben Ong"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87079","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Ames","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0035086","middle_name":"John","last_name":"Ames","source_individual_id":"5013190","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Ames"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86090","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glynda Kinsella","data":{"first_name":"Glynda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020126","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Kinsella","source_individual_id":"5015721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Glynda Kinsella"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82138","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Elsdon Storey","data":{"first_name":"Elsdon","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016466","middle_name":"","last_name":"Storey","source_individual_id":"RMIS137151","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Elsdon Storey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81172","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Saling","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016036","middle_name":"Martin","last_name":"Saling","source_individual_id":"RMIS57346","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Saling"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81043","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/62384","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"DETERMINING THE ROLE OF ER STRESS INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN THYMIC NEGATIVE SELECTION","data":{"media_summary":"ischaemia","end_year":2011,"keywords":["Antigen presentation","Apoptosis","Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress","Thymic Negative selection","Transgenic mouse"],"nhmrc_grant_id":487311,"application_year":2007,"health_keywords":["Cancer","Diabetes","Pancreatitis","hypothyroidism","ischaemia"],"scientific_title":"DETERMINING THE ROLE OF ER STRESS INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN THYMIC NEGATIVE SELECTION","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Malaria is one of the biggest scourges of mankind. This project aims to translate the available genomic data into functional insights using frontier technology to identify new intervention targets for P. falciparum infection. Developing novel targets against malaria is important from a humanitarian point of view, and also to safeguard Australia and its neighbouring regions against the social and economical implication of this disease. The malaria parasite seeks shelter from the host immune system by hiding in red blood cells, but at the same time it has to stay in contact with the blood environment. This is achieved by export of virulence factors onto the surface of malaria parasite-infected red blood cells, which are essential for the maintenance of malaria infection. Without these virulence factors the body's immune system can get rid of the malaria parasites by itself. For display on the surface the proteins have to pass several membranes and are transferred through the red blood cell. The whole transport and assembly process of the virulence factors into functional units is very complex and requires several helper and co-helper molecules. With the deciphering of the malarial genetic code it became obvious that the parasite displays an unusual large number of co-helper molecules, which are putatively exported into the red blood cell. We will generate transgenic parasites deficient in the expression of these exported co-helper proteins and assess their role on the pathogenesis of this debilitating infectious disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Melanie Rug","data":{"first_name":"Melanie","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021849","middle_name":"","last_name":"Rug","source_individual_id":"5017287","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Melanie Rug"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82622","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Alexander Maier","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020586","middle_name":"G","last_name":"Maier","source_individual_id":"5016155","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Alexander Maier"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82261","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61991","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Conservative management of lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2010,"keywords":["conservative","disc herniation","exercise","radiculopathy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":454850,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Conservative management of lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rehabilitation and Therapy: Occupational and Physical","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Andrew Hahne","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Postgraduate Scholarships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/454850","simplified_title":"Conservative management of lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy","sub_type":"Public Health Postgraduate Scholarship","total_budget":"114903.92","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Andrew Hahne","data":{"first_name":"Andrew","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0042811","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hahne","source_individual_id":"5015041","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Andrew Hahne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88094","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61582","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Epidemiology and managemnet of foot disorders in community-dwelling older Australians","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2011,"keywords":["arthritis","foot disorders"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433049,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Epidemiology and managemnet of foot disorders in community-dwelling older Australians","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Podiatry","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"OTHER MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Hylton Menz","higher_grant_type":"Career Development Fellowships","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433049","simplified_title":"Epidemiology and managemnet of foot disorders in community-dwelling older Australians","sub_type":"Clinical CDF","total_budget":"471058.72","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Hylton Menz","data":{"first_name":"Hylton","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014952","middle_name":"Bryce","last_name":"Menz","source_individual_id":"RMIS1949752","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Hylton Menz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80753","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61144","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Building public health capacity for complex questions, complex settings complex interventions","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2012,"keywords":["Complex interventions","Health inequalities","Health services research","Menternal and child health","Primary health care"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433043,"application_year":2006,"start_year":2007,"scientific_title":"Building public health capacity for complex questions, complex settings complex interventions","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Rhonda Small","higher_grant_type":"Capacity","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433043","simplified_title":"Complex questions, complex settings, complex interventions","sub_type":"Population Health Capacity Building Grant","total_budget":"2486195.69","source_system":"We describe a program of continuing education and development for postdoctoral staff in the transition from completing a PhD to becoming independent researchers. Their goals - and ours - are that at the end of the program they will initiate their own research programs, as part of a research team and will secure competitive funding to do so. The focus of the application is building capacity across two research groups, with the Lead Applicants (LA's) developing the formal program. Mother and Child Health Research, La Trobe University and the Department of General Practice, University of Melbourne are sited in Carlton and the LA's have a more than 10 year history of successful collaboration and a strong interest in mothers' and children's health. The applicants have a record of tackling difficult research, including population groups who are often excluded - Indigenous and immigrant women - and addressing difficult questions. The program of research addresses a set of complex problems ranging from intimate partner violence to preterm birth and substance abuse. These come to light in primary care, hospitals or communities. These problems require complex interventions, developed from a broad research base, to be implemented in different settings with diverse designs, from qualitative research to community trials. Multi-level interventions to change policy or practice, and health service and health economic evaluations will also be important aspects. Individual mentoring by LA's will involve specific supervision, mentoring and support of Team Investigators (TI's). There will also be co-mentoring by TI's, personal development and skills development. The research program will build capacity through participation in multidisciplinary research. The importance of research transfer and research translation will be emphasized through lunchtime seminars on public health advocacy, with content and policy component, led by TI's and supported by LA. There will be a national conference allowance for presentation of research findings, with a prior presentation to all staff here for feedback. Workshops will be held by LA's and TI's with established skills in reviewing manuscripts for journals and in editing. The outcomes of this program will be a stronger research capacity, improved research, sound health policy, better health care and improved health."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Christine Macarthur","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026425","middle_name":"","last_name":"Macarthur","source_individual_id":"5016106","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Christine Macarthur"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83831","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jeanne Daly","data":{"first_name":"Jeanne","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0024380","middle_name":"","last_name":"Daly","source_individual_id":"5014185","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Jeanne Daly"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83256","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judith Lumley","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008767","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Lumley","source_individual_id":"RMIS141965","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Judith Lumley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79071","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rhonda Small","data":{"first_name":"Rhonda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004696","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Small","source_individual_id":"RMIS6607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rhonda Small"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77975","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jane Gunn","data":{"first_name":"Jane","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0001950","middle_name":"Maree","last_name":"Gunn","source_individual_id":"RMIS223953","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Jane Gunn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77198","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephanie Brown","data":{"first_name":"Stephanie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000588","middle_name":"Janne","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS6518","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephanie Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76817","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61143","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Caseload midwifery for women at low risk of medical complications: a randomised controlled trial","data":{"media_summary":"patient satisfaction","end_year":2011,"keywords":["caesarean section","continuity of care","economic evaluation","midwifery","randomised controlled trial"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433040,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["breastfeeding","caesarean section","continuity of care","economic evaluation","patient satisfaction"],"scientific_title":"Caseload midwifery for women at low risk of medical complications: a randomised controlled trial","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Midwifery","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"NURSING","cia_name":"A/Pr Helen McLachlan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433040","simplified_title":"One-on-one midwifery care for women at low risk of medical complications: a randomised controlled trial","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"604527.96","source_system":"In June 2004, the Victorian Department of Human Services released a policy document Future directions for Victoria's maternity services. The document endorsed the expansion of public models of maternity care that offer 'one on one' midwifery care (caseload). This model has had limited evaluation with safety and efficacy largely unknown. Research conducted in the UK and in Australia has largely measured the effect of teams of care providers (commonly 6-12 midwives) with only two in the UK testing caseload care. Studies of continuity of midwifery teams have reported reduced caesareans and other interventions in labour. They have also found increased satisfaction, with no statistically significant differences in health outcomes for babies. Women who are identified at low medical risk will be recruited from the antenatal clinic of a large, tertiary, public maternity hospital. Women will be randomly allocated to caseload midwifery or standard low risk care. Those allocated to caseload will receive pregnancy, birth and postnatal care from a primary midwife with one or two pregnancy visits to be conducted by a 'back-up' midwife. The midwife will collaborate with obstetricians and other health professionals as necessary. This will be the first RCT of caseload midwifery care in Australia and only the third one conducted anywhere. It is a unique opportunity to provide a rigorous evaluation of a model that is beginning to be implemented widely in Australia. The trial will provide much needed information regarding the outcomes of caseload midwifery including interventions in childbirth, safety, costs, women's satisfaction with care and impact on the midwifery workforce. The study will provide data that will inform clinical practice and guide service providers involved in the organisation of maternity services."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Della Forster","data":{"first_name":"Della","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0042447","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Forster","source_individual_id":"5014691","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Della Forster"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88009","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Tanya Farrell","data":{"first_name":"Tanya","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0030630","middle_name":"","last_name":"Farrell","source_individual_id":"5014586","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Ms Tanya Farrell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84959","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Jeremy Oats","data":{"first_name":"Jeremy","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0021193","middle_name":"Nicolle","last_name":"Oats","source_individual_id":"5016770","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Jeremy Oats"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82432","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Helen Mclachlan","data":{"first_name":"Helen","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0014885","middle_name":"L","last_name":"Mclachlan","source_individual_id":"5016379","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Helen Mclachlan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80728","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Mary-Ann Davey","data":{"first_name":"Mary-Ann","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0012625","middle_name":"","last_name":"Davey","source_individual_id":"5014207","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Mary-Ann Davey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80121","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judith Lumley","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008767","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Lumley","source_individual_id":"RMIS141965","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Judith Lumley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79071","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61142","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Investigation of the roles of calcium-dependent proteases in muscle damage and disease","data":{"media_summary":"muscular dystrophy","end_year":2009,"keywords":["E-C coupling","eccentric exercise","intracellular calcium","muscle contraction","single muscle fibre"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433034,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["muscle","muscle damage","muscle disease characterised by dystrophic muscle","muscle fatigue","muscular dystrophy"],"scientific_title":"Investigation of the roles of calcium-dependent proteases in muscle damage and disease","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Graham Lamb","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433034","simplified_title":"Calcium-dependent proteases in muscle damage and disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"360160.05","source_system":"Muscle strength is important to the health and well-being of everyone. Skeletal muscle weakening occurs as a result of certain disease states, aging and prolonged inactivity due to illness-injury-surgery. This can result in the loss of normal activity and mobility and an increased incidence of falls and accidents, which impact considerably on health care costs. There is a family of proteins called calpains that have been linked to a number of factors affecting muscle function, however it is not known how they are involved. Calpains are proteases, ie. they destroy other proteins, and they are regulated by the concentration of calcium inside a cell. The calcium concentration increases dramatically inside a muscle cell when it contracts. Inside a muscle cell it is important that there is tight regulation of the calpains to avoid them being activated inappropriately during normal use and causing muscle damage. In certain disease states, such as types of muscular dystrophy, it is known that the calcium concentration within resting muscle fibres is increased compared with healthy muscle fibres. We propose that as a consequence of this, the calpains will be less regulated and will cause damage to the muscle, which contributes to the muscle weakness seen in these diseases. Whilst calpains have been implicated with symptoms associated with muscle dystrophies, the role they play is certainly unclear. The objectives of our research proposal are to understand what factors influence i) where the calpains are located and ii) when and how much they are activated, within muscle fibres. We will compare this in healthy muscle and muscle from mdx mice, an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham Lamb","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026120","middle_name":"Douglas","last_name":"Lamb","source_individual_id":"RMIS228857","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Graham Lamb"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83756","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Robyn Murphy","data":{"first_name":"Robyn","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0021039","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Murphy","source_individual_id":"5016618","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Robyn Murphy"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82390","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61141","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Regulation of mitochondrial fission, fusion and distribution","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["cell growth/differentiation","energy metabolism","organelle mophology","oxidative stress and apoptosis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433029,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease","mitochondrial diseases: infant, child, adult","molecular basis of disease","neurodegenerative disease"],"scientific_title":"Regulation of mitochondrial fission, fusion and distribution","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

They were once thought of as small bean-shaped organelles floating around in our cells, but it is now known that mitochondria instead form networks of tubules that undergo changes in their shape through both fission and fusion events. Mitochondria are transported along microtubules that act as highways in the cell so that they can be distributed to areas that require ATP or other specialist functions such as uptake and release of calcium. In specialist cells, mitochondria are organised even further. Sperm cells contain mitochondria packed around the mid-piece of the flagellum so that ATP can be utilised directly for swimming. Proper mitochondrial distribution also appears to be required for nerve cell development and function while in pancreatic cells they sit at the cell's edge and help regulate the secretion of insulin into the bloodstream. While we now realise the great importance of mitochondria to the cell, we are only beginning to work out how these organelles undergo the drastic morphological changes which are essential for cellular function. Of the few known components involved in shaping mitochondria, some have been found to be essential to life and their gene mutations are linked to neurological disorders, while others appear to be recruited in the activation of cell death pathways. In this application, we plan to identify and characterise the proteins involved in movement and shaping of these organelles.

These complexes consist of many different protein subunits and are built by the help of numerous known and unknown assembly factors. For example, assembly of Complex I of the respiratory chain requires 39 different proteins that are made outside mitochondria and are then transported inside to be somehow joined together with the 7 other subunits that are made by mitochondria. This is clearly a complicated procedure and we have little information on how its assembly is achieved. We do know however that mistakes in the assembly of these complexes (particularly Complex I) do happen. In Australia, about 50 children born each year have inherited disorders of mitochondrial energy generation. The most severe disorders cause infant death, while others present later causing a range of degenerative diseases, particularly affecting brain, muscle and heart. Defects in the respiratory chain have also been implicated in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, type-2 diabetes and in cell death. In order to understand how respiratory complex defects cause disease, we need to understand more about how these complexes are built. The aim of this proposal is to investigate how Complex I is assembled, how it interacts with other respiratory complexes, and to identify and characterise proteins that aid in its assembly. We will also analyse assembly defects in cells from patients with suspected respiratory complex deficiencies. This work will aid in our understanding of not only how protein complexes are built, but how defects in their assembly can cause disease. This will be informative to families of affected individuals and may aid in future diagnosis and prevention of diseases where defects in mitochondria are implicated."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Ryan","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039468","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Ryan","source_individual_id":"RMIS524395","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Ryan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87237","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Matthew Mckenzie","data":{"first_name":"Matthew","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0032498","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mckenzie","source_individual_id":"5016370","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Dr Matthew Mckenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85410","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Thorburn","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016655","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Thorburn","source_individual_id":"5017926","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Thorburn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81225","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61139","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Randomised controlled trial of a tailored podiatry intervention to enhance mobility and prevent falls in older people","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["ageing","chronic musculoskeletal pain","footwear","osteoarthritis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433027,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["falls","gait","geriatrics"],"scientific_title":"Randomised controlled trial of a tailored podiatry intervention to enhance mobility and prevent falls in older people","start_year":2008,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"A/Pr Hylton Menz","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433027","simplified_title":"Effects of podiatry on mobility and falls in older people","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"730975.41","source_system":"Foot problems affect 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 years and are associated with reduced walking speed, difficulty performing activities of daily living, impaired balance and increased risk of falls. Although a range of health professionals provide treatment for foot disorders, the most common chronic foot problems in older people (such as corns and calluses, nail disorders and toe deformities) are frequently managed by podiatrists using treatments such as scalpel debridement of lesions, foot orthoses, exercise prescription and footwear modifications. The 1995 National Health Survey reported that persons aged 80 years or over were most likely to have reported visiting a podiatrist in the previous two weeks, followed by those aged 65-79 years. Similarly, the Australian Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides podiatry services to veterans and their dependants, documented 606,706 episodes of podiatry care to 103,540 veterans in 1998-1999, at a cost of $23M. Podiatry therefore plays a substantial role in the maintenance of foot health and mobility in older Australians. Despite the detrimental effects of foot problems and the widespread utilisation of podiatry services by older people, very few studies have been undertaken to ascertain the efficacy of podiatry treatments. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an individualised podiatry intervention designed to reduce pain, enhance functional mobility and prevent falls in older people. Given the high prevalence of foot-related disability and falls in older people and their associated health care costs, the study findings will be of considerable public health importance. If found to be clinically effective, the intervention could be easily implemented into a range of healthcare settings and adopted in both state and federal falls prevention policies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Stephen Lord","data":{"first_name":"Stephen","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038138","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Lord","source_individual_id":"RMIS5224","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Stephen Lord"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86883","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Hylton Menz","data":{"first_name":"Hylton","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0014952","middle_name":"Bryce","last_name":"Menz","source_individual_id":"RMIS1949752","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Hylton Menz"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80753","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61138","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"A single fibre approach to the study of regulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle","data":{"media_summary":"Musculoskeletal physiology","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Muscle","Muscle fibre types","Physiology","Regulation of protein synthesis by calcium","Stretch-induced regulation of protein synthesis"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433021,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["Muscle","Muscle atrophy in aging","Muscle wasting","Muscle weakness","Musculoskeletal physiology"],"scientific_title":"A single fibre approach to the study of regulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Physiology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof D.

Loss of muscle mass is a major cause of frailty and loss of functionality in the elderly and is also a common feature of many chronic diseases such as cancer, HIV, arthritis and chronic heart failure. Changes in protein synthesis are intrinsically associated with alterations in muscle mass, which is integral to health, physical performance and independent living. In this project we aim to answer some important outstanding questions regarding the regulation of protein synthesis in mammalian skeletal muscle using a novel, single cell approach. Results obtained within the framework of the project will contribute to the understanding of the regulation of cellular and molecular events underpinning protein synthesis in muscle, which is critical for developing effective strategies of treatment and management of various medical conditions to prevent muscle wasting."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Markandeya Jois","data":{"first_name":"Markandeya","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037586","middle_name":"","last_name":"Jois","source_individual_id":"RMIS3752010","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Markandeya Jois"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86735","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof D.

Dysregulation of apoptosis can contribute to many conditions including cancer, autoimmune and degenerative diseases. To develop therapeutic reagents that promote cell death when it fails to occur, or prevent it from happening inappropriately, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms controlling apoptosis. To date, many of the important insights into mammalian cell death signalling have been informed by studies of apoptotic pathways in simpler, experimentally tractable model organisms. This project will exploit biochemical approaches and powerful yeast-based tools developed by CI-A to further explore cell death pathways of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and compare these with mammalian apoptosis pathways. Key findings will be verified using genetic approaches. Most apoptotic stimuli ultimately kill mammalian, insect or nematode cells by triggering activation of proteases termed caspases. However, the mechanisms by which caspase activity is regulated appear to differ somewhat between mammals and worms. We will address two general possibilities: either these animals really do differ significantly in the upstream regulation of cell death pathways, or that functional counterparts of key components have not hitherto been identified or fully characterised. Understanding the way in which mammalian apoptosis is regulated will aid in the design of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents for the many diseases in which dysregulation of apoptosis has been implicated. This project seeks to define the extent to which apoptotic regulation is conserved between mammals and nematodes. This knowledge will enable researchers to maximise the utility of nematode cell death models for the further elucidation of mammalian cell death regulatory mechanisms, and to explore how apoptosis can be manipulated for clinical benefit."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Christine Hawkins","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042948","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hawkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS412152","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Christine Hawkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88127","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/61134","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Trafficking of the cytoadherence-mediating protein to the host cell surface in malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2009,"keywords":["Plasmodium falciparum","cytoadherence","laser scanning confocal microscopy","protein trafficking","transfection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":433005,"application_year":2006,"health_keywords":["cerebral malaria","drug resistance","malaria","placental malaria"],"scientific_title":"Trafficking of the cytoadherence-mediating protein to the host cell surface in malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes","start_year":2007,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Leann Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/433005","simplified_title":"How does the major virulence factor get to the host cell surface in malaria parasite-infected red blood cells?","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"547315.08","source_system":"Malaria kills between 1 and 3 million children each year. In addition, the disease debilitates the adult population in malaria-endemic areas, thereby contributing to the cycle of poverty in many third world countries. As resistance to existing antimalarial drugs increases, there is an urgent need to understand the workings of the parasite at a molecular level to enable the development of alternative antimalarial strategies. During part of its life cycle, the malaria parasite infects the red blood cells of its human host. The parasite transports proteins to the red blood cell membrane so as to modify the properties of its adopted cellular residence. The parasite proteins that are deposited at or in the red blood cell membrane increase the leakiness and the stickiness of the parasitised red blood cells. This allows more efficient uptake of nutrients and allows the parasitised red blood cells to adhere to blood vessel walls, thereby avoiding passage through the spleen. Adherence of parasitised red blood cells to capillaries in the brain and the placenta is thought to lead to the development of the complications known as 'cerebral' and 'placental' malaria. These complications are responsible for the deaths of many children and pregnant women. We propose to use cell biology techniques to introduce foreign genes into malaria parasite-infected red blood cells to unravel the details of the molecular machinery and the ticketing system that the parasite uses to traffic its virulence proteins to their correct destinations. These studies could potentially lead to the development of novel intervention strategies. For example, if it were possible to decrease the levels of surface expression of a protein known as PfEMP1, adhesion of infected red blood cells would be inhibited. This would greatly decrease the impact of this important human pathogen."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leann

The emerging virus West Nile virus (strain New York) is a member of this virus family and shares 99% amino acid homology with the endemic Australian virus Kunjin virus. During virus growth in cells, cellular membrane structures are induced or rearranged by these viruses for their own purpose. That being the production of more virus particles for reinfection of other cells. Using Kunjin virus as a model, and advanced techniques in biochemistry and electron microscopy, we have identified for the first time these membrane structures as the apparent sites of replication of the viral RNA or genetic material, and of the viral proteins involved. We have also observed how new virus particles are able to get out of infected cells and shown how some drugs can prevent this occurring thus limiting their transmission. This research will focus on how the membrane structures are formed in infected cells. The research will determine what cellular components are required by the virus to help it propagate. In particular specific cellular proteins and membrane components that are captured by the virus and moved to different sites in the infected cells. These apparent requirements could possibly lead us to a greater understanding of the complex interactions that occur between the invading virus and the host cells. We aim to directly visualize the process of infection within living cells using new and innovative microscopic techniques. Another of our objectives is to determine the effects of infection on normal cells. The question being whether flavivirus infection disrupts normalcell fuctions like secretion etc. An understanding of these processes, and how the viral RNA is copied into new RNA for more virus particles, will assist in the development of antiviral drugs for treatment of this pathogenic group of viruses."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Alexander Khromykh","data":{"first_name":"Alexander","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0043491","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Khromykh","source_individual_id":"RMIS12877","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Alexander Khromykh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88276","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Jason Mackenzie","data":{"first_name":"Jason","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038214","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Mackenzie","source_individual_id":"RMIS56171","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Jason Mackenzie"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86904","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/6375","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Mechanisms responsible for hypertension caused by perinatal omega-3 fatty acid deficiency","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["cardiovascular physiology","fetal programming","hypertension","neural development","nutrition"],"nhmrc_grant_id":350313,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["cardiovascular disease","cerebrovascular disease","hypertension","nutritional deficiency"],"scientific_title":"Mechanisms responsible for hypertension caused by perinatal omega-3 fatty acid deficiency","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Systems Physiology","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Richard Weisinger","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/350313","simplified_title":"Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency-induced hypertension","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"280650","source_system":"Does the nourishment we receive as babies, or even before birth, affect our adult health? The recent findings from Barker, Meaney, Langley-Evans and their co-workers, has established that intra-uterine and early post-natal factors, particularly nutrition, influence adult neural development and cardiovascular function. It appears that the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids in early life may be a critical factor in the development of hypertension. We reported (Nature Medicine 2001, 7: 258-259) for the first time that the essential omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), supplied in the early developmental period, affects blood pressure later in life. The work showed that moderate omega-3 fatty acid deficiency in the perinatal period resulted in hypertension, despite reversal of the deficiency at a time months before the assessment of blood pressure. These findings are suggestive of a critical period, during which time the development of normal blood pressure control mechanisms appears, at least partially, dependent upon the supply of omega-3 fatty acids. These findings suggest that omega-3 deficiency early in life may affect fatty acid metabolism, transport or uptake systems, such that re-feeding of the nutrients is functionally ineffective. Alternatively, deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids early in life may arrest development of one or more of the key signalling pathways in the control of blood pressure, such as the Brain Angiotensin System. The influence of dietary omega-3 fatty acid supply, relative to the critical period, on expression of genes involved in the control of blood pressure as well as in fatty acid metabolism, will be defined. Also, the role of the brain angiotensin system in omega-3 fatty acid deficiency-induced hypertension will be determined. We expect that the results of this study will profoundly affect hypertension research, as well as nutrition, particularly that for infants."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Harrison

responsible for the deaths of about two million children each year. As drugs, such as chloroquine, become increasingly useless due to the development of parasite resistance, there is an urgent need to understand the mode of action of and the molecular basis of resistance to existing antimalarials and to design affordable treatments that can replace chloroquine. It is known that some compounds, that have only poor antimalarial activity themselves, can synergise the action of chloroquine. This may involve the inhibition of the activity of proteins that directly or indirectly extrude chloroquine from its site of action in the parasite's digestive apparatus. Unfortunately, thechloroquine synergisers examined to date have been too toxic to be useful in vivo. In preliminary studies we have identified some compounds that would be suitable for use in malaria patients, including a widely used antimalarial drug, primaquine, that can synergise the activity of chloroquine against chloroquine-resistant parasites. We will attempt to understand the molecular basis of this interaction. This will allow us to define optimal combinations of chloroquine and a resistance-reversing quinoline for use treating malaria. This could extend the clinical life of this important antimalarial drug. The information obtained may also help to design novel antimalarial drugs."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leann Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Leann","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040079","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS5525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leann Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87379","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5948","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Prevalence and characterisation of FMR1 gene's premutation carriers amongst older males presenting with tremor/ataxia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2007,"keywords":["dynamic mutations","fragile X","medical genetics","neurology"],"nhmrc_grant_id":330400,"application_year":2004,"health_keywords":["fragile x syndrome","molecular diagnosis","movement disorders"],"scientific_title":"Prevalence and characterisation of FMR1 gene's premutation carriers amongst older males presenting with tremor/ataxia","start_year":2005,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Genetics","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Dr Danuta Loesch","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/330400","simplified_title":"Clinical, genetic and prevalence study of older males with movement disorders and premutation in a fragile X gene","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"199450","source_system":"The study concerns a novel form of progressive neurological disorder associated with tremor and body imbalance occurring in older males and caused by a small expansion of the trinucleotide (CGG) repeat in a fragile X (FMR1) gene. This expansion is termed 'premutation', in contrast with the full mutation, where a large expansion of the CGG repeat in this gene causes Fragile X Syndrome, a common form of intellectual disability. While brain anomaly in the full mutation is caused by a deficit of the FMR1 specific protein product (FMRP), the pathways from premutation to a neurological disorder are unknown. In this disorder, neurological dysfunction is associated with brain atrophy visible in magnetic resonance (MRI) images. Molecular studies showed increased levels of 'messenger' RNA (mRNA), which indicates overexpression of FMR1 gene . Our own study showed significantly increased (41.7%) prevalence of neurological involvement in male premutation carriers aged >50, compared with age-matched norms. Moreover, a screening of patients with two neurological disorders associated with tremor showed a significant increase of premutation carriers (5%- 22%). The aim of this study is to test hypotheses about the association of late-onset neurological disorders of unknown cause presenting tremor and imbalance, with a fragile X premutation in males, by screening for the presence of this premutation; and then conducting a full assessment of the identified premutation carriers, including detailed neurological, neuropsychological and MRI tests, to establish the spectrum of neurological involvement. This involvement will be correlated with the molecular (DNA, mRNA, FMRP) findings. The results will contribute to understanding the mechanisms of neurological involvement caused by this premutation. Moreover, estimation of the prevalence of this premutation in relevant neurological disorders will impact on standard diagnostic, and possibly future treatment approaches in neurology clinics."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Danuta Loesch","data":{"first_name":"Danuta","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0020458","middle_name":"Z","last_name":"Loesch","source_individual_id":"RMIS74228","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Danuta Loesch"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82229","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Glynda Kinsella","data":{"first_name":"Glynda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0020126","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Kinsella","source_individual_id":"5015721","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Glynda Kinsella"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82138","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Flora Tassone","data":{"first_name":"Flora","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0016572","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tassone","source_individual_id":"RMIS3066374","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Flora Tassone"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81202","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Mark Cook","data":{"first_name":"Mark","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0012447","middle_name":"James","last_name":"Cook","source_individual_id":"RMIS5644","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Mark Cook"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80066","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Huggins","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008020","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Huggins","source_individual_id":"RMIS74231","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Richard Huggins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78870","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Robert Gardner","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007420","middle_name":"Jm","last_name":"Gardner","source_individual_id":"RMIS3066365","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Robert Gardner"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78703","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5947","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Dissection of the mechanisms of action of evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway components","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Bcl-2","Caspase","Nematode","Signal transduction","Yeast"],"nhmrc_grant_id":284513,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Autoimmune disease","Cancer","Degenerative disease"],"scientific_title":"Dissection of the mechanisms of action of evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway components","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Defects in apoptosis can contribute to cancer or autoimmune disease. Conversely, diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease have been linked to excessive cell death. To develop drugs that promote apoptosis when it fails to occur, or prevent inappropriate cell death, it is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling apoptosis. The first recognised component of the mammalian cell death machinery was Bcl-2; a protein associated with development of cancer. Despite much research since then, the way in which Bcl-2 and related proteins function is still unknown. This project capitalises on previous genetic and biochemical studies in a model genetic organism (the roundworm) to address this important issue. Animal cell death pathway components can be introduced into yeast such that activation of the introduced pathways leads to yeast death and its inhibition promotes yeast survival. We have used this approach to reconstitute the worm cell death pathway and a major mammalian apoptosis pathway in yeast. Yeast strains bearing these reconstituted pathways will be used to test functional equivalence of candidate mammalian proteins and their putative roundworm counterparts. The system will also be exploited to identify and characterise novel proteins that regulate cell death in mammals and worms. Understanding the way in which key molecules regulate apoptosis will assist in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents for many diseases in which cell death regulation is perturbed. This project capitalises on the evolutionary conservation of apoptosis to characterise the mechanisms of action of important mammalian apoptotic regulators and to seek novel mammalian apoptotic pathway components. Proteins identified in this way are likely to be important apoptotic regulators, as our approach ensures that their functions are evolutionarily conserved."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Christine Hawkins","data":{"first_name":"Christine","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0042948","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hawkins","source_individual_id":"RMIS412152","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Christine Hawkins"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88127","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5170","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Development of novel reagents for the point-of-care(field) diagnosis &differentiation of the malaria parasites, Plasmodi","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Antibodies","Diagnostics","Malaria"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280634,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Development of novel reagents for the point-of-care(field) diagnosis &differentiation of the malaria parasites, Plasmodi","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Diagnostic Applications","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"BIOTECHNOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Leann Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Development Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280634","simplified_title":"Development of malaria diagnostic","sub_type":"Development Grant","total_budget":"117000","source_system":"Malaria is a major global health problem. 500 million people become infected with malaria parasites every year and 2-3 million people die each year from the disease.

It has a negative effect on the mental and physical health of women and their children. Because of poor health, victimised women and children are frequent attenders to family doctors (GPs), but doctors face many barriers in making an effective response. One of these barriers is the critical absence of evidence for what would help women attending GPs in dealing with partner abuse. This is vital to inform both GP training and clinical practice. There is sound evidence that home visiting or support by peers improves the health of disadvantaged mothers and children. Similarly, advocacy improves the health and wellbeing of abused women. The MOSAIC community intervention trial combines these two elements: home visiting-peer support and domestic violence advocacy and this strategy will be evaluated in a randomised trial. The trial aims to reduce partner abuse and depression among women pregnant or with children under 5 attending GPs. It also aims to strengthen mother-child bonds. Trained and supported GPs from 40 participating practices will identify 700 abused or at risk women over a 40 week period. Women in the intervention arm of the trial, identified as abused or at risk by their GPs will be offered the support of trained para-professional 'mentor mothers' for up to a year, while the comparison arm will be offered standard GP care. Recent funding allows a pilot study of mentor mother recruitment and training to be undertaken in 2003. The study will strengthen GP support for this difficult issue and build a 'critical mass' of GPs interested in partner abuse management in the 5 participating divisions. The MOSAIC study will assess the value to GPs and women of an enhanced support system for victims' care and provide much needed evidence of an intervention embedded in general practice to reduce partner abuse of pregnant women and women with young children."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Angela Taft","data":{"first_name":"Angela","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0034159","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Taft","source_individual_id":"RMIS680130","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Angela Taft"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85844","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judith Lumley","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008767","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Lumley","source_individual_id":"RMIS141965","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Judith Lumley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79071","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Kelsey Hegarty","data":{"first_name":"Kelsey","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0007810","middle_name":"Lee","last_name":"Hegarty","source_individual_id":"5012596","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Kelsey Hegarty"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78808","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rhonda Small","data":{"first_name":"Rhonda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004696","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Small","source_individual_id":"RMIS6607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rhonda Small"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77975","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5047","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Biogenesis of Respiratory Chain Complex I and Analysis of Assembly Defects in Patients with Mitochondrial Disease","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["membrane protein","mitochondrial dynamics","molecular pathogenesis","protein-protein interactions"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280615,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["mitochondrial diseases: infant, child and adult","molecular basis of disease","oxidative stress"],"scientific_title":"Biogenesis of Respiratory Chain Complex I and Analysis of Assembly Defects in Patients with Mitochondrial Disease","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Clinical Medicine and Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"A/Pr Michael Ryan","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280615","simplified_title":"Assembly Defects of Respiratory Chain Complex I in Patients with Mitochondrial Disease","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"254250","source_system":"Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is a large assembly of protein subunits that is involved in the main production of cellular energy. Complex I is found in intracellular compartments termed mitochondria. The predicament for Complex I is that in order for it to be built, it requires 38 different proteins that are made in one place in the cell to be imported into mitochondria and then somehow joined together with the 7 other subunits that are made by mitochondria. This is clearly a complicated procedure and we have little information on how its assembly is achieved. We do know however that mistakes in the assembly of Complex I do happen. In Australia, about 50 children born each year have inherited disorders of mitochondrial energy generation. The most severe disorders cause infant death, while others present later causing a range of degenerative diseases, particularly affecting brain, muscle and heart. The most common defect in these patients is a loss in the activity of Complex I. Interestingly it seems that in most cases, the defect is not due to a mutation in one or more of the Complex I subunits and so we believe that such defects arise form accessory proteins that are involved in the construction of Complex I. The aim of this proposal is to investigate how Complex I is assembled and to identify and characterise accessory proteins. We will also analyse assembly defects by studying skin fibroblasts from patients. This work will aid in our understanding of not only how protein complexes are built, but how defects in their assembly can cause disease. This will not only be informative to families of affected individuals but may aid in future diagnosis and prevention of mitochondrial disease."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Ryan","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039468","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Ryan","source_individual_id":"RMIS524395","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Ryan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87237","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof David Thorburn","data":{"first_name":"David","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0016655","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Thorburn","source_individual_id":"5017926","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof David Thorburn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/81225","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5046","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Fission, fusion and distribution of mitochondria in mammalian cells","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Cell biology","Membrane physiology","Mitochondrial dynamics","Protein structure","Protein-protein interactions"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280614,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["Cell growth/differentiation","Mitochondrial disease","Molecular basis of disease"],"scientific_title":"Fission, fusion and distribution of mitochondria in mammalian cells","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

Mitochondria were once thought of as small bean-shaped organelles floating around in the cell, however it has become clear that this is not the case. Mitochondria are found as a network of tubules radiating from around the nucleus and they undergo constant changes in their shape through both fission and fusion events. Mitochondria are transported along microtubules which act as highways in the cell so that they can be distributed to areas that require ATP or other functions particular to mitochondria such as their ability to regulate the release of calcium. In specialist cells, mitochondria are organised even further. Sperm cells contain mitochondria packed around the mid-piece of the flagellum so that ATP can be utilised directly for swimming. Mitochondria are also highly organised in muscle cells to supply ATP for movement while in pancreatic cells mitochondria at the cell's edge help to regulate the secretion of molecules such as insulin into the bloodstream. While we are beginning to understand the great importance of mitochondria to the cell, we are yet to work out how these organelles undergo the drastic morphological changes which are essential for cellular function. In this application, we plan to identify and characterise the proteins involved in the division of mitochodria and the movement of these organelles along the microtubule highways. Understanding the basic mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics in tissue culture cells will provide valuable insights into mitochondrial segregation and specialisation in differentiated cells such as sperm, nerve, muscle and pancreatic cells, where such events are crucial for function."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Ryan","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039468","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Ryan","source_individual_id":"RMIS524395","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Michael Ryan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87237","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Jacqueline Gulbis","data":{"first_name":"Jacqueline","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0037019","middle_name":"Margot","last_name":"Gulbis","source_individual_id":"RMIS75205","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Jacqueline Gulbis"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86583","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5045","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Role of Molecular Chaperones and Proteases in Mitochondrial Function","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["mitochondria","molecular chaperones and proteases","peptide presentation","protein targeting","stress response"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280613,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["inherited disease","mitochondrial diseases","myopathies","neurodegenerative diseases"],"scientific_title":"The Role of Molecular Chaperones and Proteases in Mitochondrial Function","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Nick Hoogenraad","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280613","simplified_title":"Regulation of Mitochondrial Function","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"432750","source_system":"Mitochondria are essential organelles providing the cell with essential molecules and being the source of oxidative energy in the cell. They are at the centre of many clinical conditions, ranging from genetic to common neurological diseases and other conditions related to ageing. We have been defining the way in which mammalian cells respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the mitochondrial compartment and have found this produces what we have called the Mitochondrial Stress Response, a process that results in the selective upregulation of a suite of genes encoding mitochondrial stress proteins. This application deals with the question of the consequences to the cell of the creation of proteolytic environment. We have found that the two major proteases of the mitochondrion are upregulated and that this results in a marked increase in the rate of degradation of mitochondrial proteins. We aim to determine the specific roles of individual proteases in this process and the consequences of this proteolysis on the efflux of peptides from the mitochondria. This question has important medical implications, as one of the consequences of defects in mitochondrial function is the loss of cells from the affected tissue. We will also address the question of how mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated. We have recently found that the cytosolic molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required for protein import into mitochondria in mammalian cells. Since Hsp90 has hitherto been shown to be a key regulatory component in the steroid hormone and tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, this finding raises the possibility that protein import and thereby mitochondrial biogenesis may be regulated via the involvement of Hsp90."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Nick Hoogenraad","data":{"first_name":"Nick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0037352","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Hoogenraad","source_individual_id":"5018916","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Nick Hoogenraad"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86678","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5044","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Protein trafficking in malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2006,"keywords":["Plasmodium falciparum","confocal fluorescence microscopy","cytoadherence","protein trafficking","transfection"],"nhmrc_grant_id":280607,"application_year":2003,"health_keywords":["cerebral malaria","drug resistance","malaria"],"scientific_title":"Protein trafficking in malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes","start_year":2004,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Protein Targeting and Signal Transduction","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Leann Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/280607","simplified_title":"Studies of the ways in which the malaria parasite alters the surface properties of its host's red blood cells","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"417750","source_system":"Malaria kills between 1 and 3 million children each year. In addition, the disease debilitates the adult population in malaria-endemic areas, thereby contributing to the cycle of poverty in many third world countries. As resistance to existing antimalarial drugs increases, there is an urgent need to understand the workings of the parasite at a molecular level to enable the development of alternative antimalarial strategies. During part of its life cycle, the malaria parasite infects the erythrocytes of its human host. The parasite transports proteins to the erythrocyte membrane so as to modify the properties of its adopted cellular residence. The parasite proteins that are deposited at or in the erythrocyte membrane increase the leakiness and the stickiness of the parasitised erythrocytes. This allows more efficient uptake of nutrients and allows the parasitised erythrocytes to adhere to blood vessel walls, thereby avoiding passage through the spleen. Adherence of parasitised erythrocytes to capillaries in the brain is thought to lead to the development of the complication known as cerebral malaria. This complication is responsible for most of the deaths due to malaria. In order to traffic the adherence proteins to the erythrocyte surface, the parasite establishes novel transport pathways for moving proteins across the erythrocyte cytoplasm. As the uninfected erythrocyte has no means, nor requirement, for moving proteins, this novel transport mechanism may represent a target for drugs that kill the malaria parasite without being toxic to humans. The pathways for the movement of proteins around the infected erythrocyte are largely unknown. We propose to use cell biology techniques and techniques to introduce foreign genes into malaria-infected erythrocytes to unravel the details of the molecular machinery and the ticketing system that the parasite uses to traffic proteins to their correct destinations in its adopted home."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leann Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Leann","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040079","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS5525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leann Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87379","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/5042","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2005,"keywords":["Equipment Grant"],"nhmrc_grant_id":264666,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2005,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Ms Marian Obenchain","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/264666","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"86970","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Marian  Obenchain","data":{"first_name":"Marian ","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0038833","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Obenchain","source_individual_id":"RMIS329345","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Marian  Obenchain"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87061","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4894","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Equipment Grant","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Equipment Grant"],"nhmrc_grant_id":264534,"application_year":2003,"start_year":2004,"scientific_title":"Equipment Grant","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"n-a","research_area":"Not Applicable","for_category":"N-A","cia_name":"Ms Marian Obenchain","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Infrastructure Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/264534","simplified_title":"Equipment Grant","sub_type":"Equipment Grant","total_budget":"62470","source_system":""},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Marian  Obenchain","data":{"first_name":"Marian ","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0038833","middle_name":"J","last_name":"Obenchain","source_individual_id":"RMIS329345","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Marian  Obenchain"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87061","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4838","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Isolation and analysis of novel apoptic pathway components","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2008,"keywords":["Cell Development"],"nhmrc_grant_id":237147,"application_year":2002,"start_year":2003,"scientific_title":"Isolation and analysis of novel apoptic pathway components","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Cell Development (incl.

calcium release and contraction in heart","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"315375","source_system":"Contraction of heart muscle is regulated by the release of calcium ions from an intracellular store known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium is released from this store to trigger contraction and then taken up again to let the heart muscle relax. Calcium flows out from the store through a specialised type of ion channel protein known as the ryanodine receptor. Recently, genetic studies have indicted that some forms of sudden cardiac death are due to mutations in the ryanodine receptor in the heart of susceptible individuals. However, nothing is currently known about how such mutations affect the function of the ryanodine receptor or how this can cause the abnormal heart beating that leads to sudden cardiac death. This project will investigate the normal functioning of the ryanodine receptor and what aberrations occur with the different mutations. This could lead to better treatment of individuals susceptible to this type of sudden cardiac death. The effectiveness of one type of drug in preventing aberrant channel behaviour will also be examined."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Graham Lamb","data":{"first_name":"Graham","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0026120","middle_name":"Douglas","last_name":"Lamb","source_individual_id":"RMIS228857","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Graham Lamb"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83756","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Derek Laver","data":{"first_name":"Derek","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0002835","middle_name":"R","last_name":"Laver","source_individual_id":"5015882","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"A/Pr Derek Laver"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77447","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4174","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Perinatal outcomes following treatment for cervical dysplasia","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Cervical dysplasia","Cohort study","Pregnancy outcome"],"nhmrc_grant_id":234418,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia","low birthweight","preterm birth"],"scientific_title":"Perinatal outcomes following treatment for cervical dysplasia","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Judith Lumley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/234418","simplified_title":"Pregnancy outcomes following treatment for cervical dysplasia","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"98600","source_system":"A very high proportion of women in Australia have regular cervical screening ('pap' tests) for early detection of any early abnormal changes of the cervix. Women with abnormalities are referred for further investigation and some go on to have the areas with abnormalities treated either by surgical removal of small amounts of tissue or by other heat or laser treatments of affected areas. Many women having these treatments are of child-bearing age and may not have had children, or may seek to have more children after treatment. There are unanswered questions about the extent to which any or all of these treatments might, by changes to the cervix, lead to preterm birth in any subsequent pregnancy. In the proposed study, records relating to women referred from 1982 to 2000 for assessment and possible treatment of cervical abnormalities at a major hospital will be linked to Victorian birth records from 1983 to 2001. This will allow a comparison of preterm birth in the group of women referred with cervical abnormalities, with preterm births in the Victorian population, and comparing women who do and don't have treatment, taking into account other important factors such as the mother's age, and her previous pregnancies. The information will be of value to women themselves, to gynaecologists and to screening services."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Michael Quinn","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0044960","middle_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Quinn","source_individual_id":"5012222","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Michael Quinn"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/88641","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr Fiona Bruinsma","data":{"first_name":"Fiona","title":"Dr","dw_individual_id":"DW0023831","middle_name":"Jane","last_name":"Bruinsma","source_individual_id":"RMIS1718707","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Dr Fiona Bruinsma"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/83118","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judith Lumley","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008767","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Lumley","source_individual_id":"RMIS141965","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Judith Lumley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79071","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4173","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The Australian Longitudinal Study of Health and Relationships","data":{"media_summary":"sexuality","end_year":2007,"keywords":["contraceptive use","men's health","reproduction","sexual health","women's health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":234409,"application_year":2002,"health_keywords":["contraception","sexual dysfuction","sexual health","sexual problems","sexuality"],"scientific_title":"The Australian Longitudinal Study of Health and Relationships","start_year":2003,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Anthony Smith","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/234409","simplified_title":"The Australian Longitudinal Study of Health and Relationships","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"2292187.5","source_system":"Achieving satisfaction in our intimate relationships is a vital component of our well being. To date, most studies of sexual and reproductive health have focused on how common particular problems might be. Thus, studies have tended to have relatively narrow focuses on, for example, the prevalence of pregnancy, miscarriage and termination, or on patterns of sexual practice and contraceptive use, or on the frequency with which individuals experience sexual difficulties. Yet, all of these are inter-related aspects of sexual and reproductive health that can have profound impacts on each other. Importantly, most of these studies have looked at these issues at a single point in time and could only infer the likely contribution of prior events on currently observed patterns. This study will recruit a random sample of Australians aged 16 to 65 years and interview them annually, initially over a four-year period. It will collect detailed information about sexual and reproductive health and provide essential information about how sexual and reproductive health changes as we age. It will document the relationships between patterns of sexual behaviour, contraceptive choices, pregnancy and its outcomes, and sexual functioning including the experience of sexual problems and the achievement of satisfaction in our physical and emotional intimate relationships."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Julia Shelley","data":{"first_name":"Julia","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0039656","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Shelley","source_individual_id":"RMIS116090","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Julia Shelley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87285","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Juliet Richters","data":{"first_name":"Juliet","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0039325","middle_name":"","last_name":"Richters","source_individual_id":"RMIS330157","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Juliet Richters"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87194","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Marian Pitts","data":{"first_name":"Marian","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0033197","middle_name":"Kathleen","last_name":"Pitts","source_individual_id":"RMIS1717973","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Marian Pitts"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85602","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Anthony Smith","data":{"first_name":"Anthony","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004706","middle_name":"","last_name":"Smith","source_individual_id":"5011962","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Anthony Smith"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77978","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/4172","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Discrimination or Discretion?

This study builds on our previous work in which we have found evidence of discrimination against people with hepatitis C in health care settings. Discrimination, inappropriate and unfair treatment against people with hepatitis C, in health care settings is a major barrier to care, treatment and support. A key strategy for developing effective strategies to reduce both perceived and real discrimination of people with hepatitis C in health care settings is to gain a better understanding of the range of issues experienced by the health care providers themselves and factors in the broader health service context that impact on optimal care. The aim of this study is to identify these factors and the findings will influence policy and practice with the ultimate goal of removing barriers to equitable and appropriate health care for people with hepatitis C. The study will focus on both people (health care providers)- the knowledge, attitudes and practices among health care professionals in relation to infection control practices, hepatitis C and injecting drug use; and contexts (health care settings)- factors in the health care settings that contribute to discriminatory, inappropriate or unfair treatment of people with hepatitis C. The study will focus specifically on health care settings of general practice, dentistry, nursing and pharmacists. The outcomes will be used to develop practical and effective strategies for both improving health care for HCV positive individuals and improving the working relationships and environments for these health professionals working with this client population."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Sandra

This research project seeks to evaluate the costs and outcomes of the PRISM intervention in order to help inform judgements about its value. PRISM is being introduced in 8 local communities in Victoria with a further 8 communities acting as comparators. The full costs of the intervention will be measured as will the impact the intervention has on the physical and mental health of mothers. Estimates of the intervention's economic benefits, that is the value that community members attach to the intervention's main outcomes will also be ascertained. In this way it is possible to judge whether or not the benefits of PRISM are worth its costs.

This disease is the most common form of intellectual disability that runs in families caused by an unusual form of change in a particular gene called FMR1, whereby a very short sequence of DNA in a gene expands by repeating itself to such an extent that once it reaches a certain size the whole gene stops working and the disease occurs. The expansion in the gene is not uniform across the generations, and only occurs when passed on from the mother to her offspring. However, many females carrying only a short sequence may pass on, for unknown reasons, either a large expanded sequence leading to disease, or one similar in size to her own. This complexity in the progression of the number of CGG repeats means that there is a relatively large number of mothers, ~1 in 300, who are quite normal but at risk of having an affected offspring. The factors that trigger this expansion in the DNA are presently not well understood, but a number of genetic markers in the FMR1 gene have been implicated. This study will assess the contribution of an array of these genetic markers in determining the risk of expansion of the short repeat from mother to offspring and hence the risk of fragile X. Conducting this study in Tasmania has two advantages. First, by having access to genealogical records that permit the linking of fragile X families we shall be able to identify common predisposing factors of fragile X more accurately. Second, by testing the whole population with intellectual disability in one State of manageable size we shall obtain an unbiased estimate of the prevalence of fragile X."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Robert Mitchell","data":{"first_name":"Robert","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0015030","middle_name":"","last_name":"Mitchell","source_individual_id":"RMIS74225","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Robert Mitchell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/80772","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/1899","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Very preterm birth case-control study","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Aetiology of preterm birth","Case-control study of preterm birth","Reproductive epidemiolgy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":148613,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["Clinical subtypes of preterm birth","Induced abortion","Spontaneous abortion","Very preterm birth"],"scientific_title":"Very preterm birth case-control study","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Ms Lyndsey Watson","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/148613","simplified_title":"Very preterm birth case-control study","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"406527.54","source_system":"Preterm birth, a birth before the 37th week of pregnancy occurs for fewer than 8% of mothers but is associated with two-thirds of all fetal deaths and deaths of liveborn infants in the first month after birth. In the late 1990s those deaths are concentrated among very preterm births i.e. births before the 32nd week of pregnancy. Infants born very preterm are very likely to need neonatal intensive care, quite likely to have had major respiratory, infectious or other problems after birth, and to need readmission to hospital in the first year after birth. Surviving infants are more likely to have major impairments, minor impairments, and school difficulties than infants born at term. There is a substantial impact on families, health services and society of very preterm birth.There has been no reduction in the proportion of births which are preterm, or very preterm in the last 20 years, though advances in treatment and care have markedly improved the survival of preterm and very preterm infants. This study will investigate the role of previous pregnancies which did not result in births (miscarriages and terminations), together with other procedures such as D and C (dilatation and curettage), in subsequent preterm birth. As these previous pregnancy losses are all fairly common experiences any associated risk is important and this particular factor has not been studied in this way before. There is preliminary evidence that they may be associated with preterm birth and the study will be able to measure the associations while taking into account all the other known risk factors. Other possible risk factors such as experiencing violence in pregnancy or social factors acting at a neighbourhood level will also be included. If it is found that previous pregnancy losses are independently associated with preterm birth it will be possible to develop and test preventive strategies."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Lyndsey Watson","data":{"first_name":"Lyndsey","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0040360","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Watson","source_individual_id":"RMIS141968","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Lyndsey Watson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87458","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judith Lumley","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008767","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Lumley","source_individual_id":"RMIS141965","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Judith Lumley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79071","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2544","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Recovery and fertility after operative delivery","data":{"media_summary":"sub-fertility","end_year":2003,"keywords":["elective caesarean section","follow-up of existing cohort","health status (SF36)","non-disclosure of health problems","operative vaginal birth"],"nhmrc_grant_id":148615,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["depression","incontinence of urine, flatus, faeces","perineal pain","sexual problems","sub-fertility"],"scientific_title":"Recovery and fertility after operative delivery","start_year":2001,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Judith Lumley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/148615","simplified_title":"Recovery and fertility after operative delivery","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"222226.72","source_system":"A significant proportion of mothers give birth assisted by forceps or vacuum extraction (Ventouse) when problems occur during labour.

In addition, the disease debilitates the adult population in malaria-endemic areas, thereby contributing to the cycle of poverty in many third world countries. As resistance to existing antimalarial drugs increases, there is an urgent need to understand the workings of the parasite at a molecular level to enable the development of alternative antimalarial strategies. During part of its life cycle, the malaria parasite infects the erythrocytes of its human host. The parasite transports proteins to the erythrocyte membrane so as to modify the properties of its adopted cellular residence. The parasite proteins that are deposited at or in the erythrocyte membrane increase the leakiness and the stickiness of the parasitised erythrocytes. This allows more efficient uptake of nutrients and allows the parasitised erythrocytes to adhere to blood vessel walls, thereby avoiding passage through the spleen. Adherence of parasitised erythrocytes to capillaries in the brain is thought to lead to the development of the complication known as cerebral malaria. This complication is responsible for most of the deaths due to malaria. In order to traffic the adherence proteins to the erythrocyte surface, the parasite establishes a novel transport pathway for moving proteins across the erythrocyte cytoplasm. As the uninfected erythrocyte has no means, nor requirement, for moving proteins, this novel transport mechanism may represent a target for drugs that kill the malaria parasite without being toxic to humans. The pathways for the movement of proteins around the infected erythrocyte are largely unknown. We propose to use techniques to introduce foreign genes into malaria-infected erythrocytes to unravel the details of the molecular machinery and the ticketing system that the parasite uses to traffic proteins to their correct destinations in its adopted home."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leann Tilley","data":{"first_name":"Leann","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0040079","middle_name":"","last_name":"Tilley","source_individual_id":"RMIS5525","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leann Tilley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87379","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Foley","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007304","middle_name":"","last_name":"Foley","source_individual_id":"RMIS522146","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Foley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78669","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/2546","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Parity, gravidity and reproductive outcome","data":{"media_summary":"termination of pregnancy","end_year":2003,"keywords":["Analysis of routine perinatal data","Early pregnancy loss","Longitudinal record-linkge","Recurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes","Total pregnancies, parity and gravidity"],"nhmrc_grant_id":148634,"application_year":2000,"health_keywords":["birth defects","perinatal death","preterm birth","spontaneous abortion","termination of pregnancy"],"scientific_title":"Parity, gravidity and reproductive outcome","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Judith Lumley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/148634","simplified_title":"Parity, gravidity and reproductive outcome","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"75000","source_system":"The starting point for this project is the recent finding that women who experience miscarriages or terminations of pregnancy before theuir first birth have an increased risk of having a preterm (premature) infant.

Heat produced by contracting muscles can cause muscle damage if muscle temperature increases above 44oC. Also, overheating from external sources can cause an increase in muscle temperature in the upper physiological range of temperature (37-44oC) which can so readily happen to humans and animals caught in blistering sun or in closed cars parked in the sun. However, very little is known about what happens to the ability of the skeletal muscle to contract when the temperature increases in this upper physiological range of temperature. This project seeks to fill in this important gap in our knowledge and increase our understanding about the existence of protective mechanisms in muscle to prevent heat-induced damage to the muscle. Such mechanisms would allow the body to operate very close to the lethal range of temperature and may be mainly responsible for the severe muscle weakness in overheated individuals. Results obtained from the project can have far reaching implications for human physiology in general and muscle and exercise physiology in particular and for developing new strategies in the treatment of collapse from body overheating. The project will also produce new knowledge regarding the mechanism of action of drugs used in the treatment of certain mental disorders but which can trigger, in susceptible individuals, uncontrolled contraction of muscles and overheating."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof D.

The aim of this study is to understand how people within a primary care system build and maintain relationships of trust between individuals and between organisations. Individuals will be interviewed to learn how they experience trust and related issues, documents will be analysed to learn about the policy and organisational environments of trust relationships, and the Trust Evaluation Scale used to measure the factors associated with trust over a two year period. The outcomes of this study will be an understanding of how organisations establish the relationships that allow them to collaborate effectively. In particular it will help us understand how they can be encouraged to share the same protocols and procedures, to share information, and become more skilful at managing organisational differences, and it will provide a deeper understanding of relationships between primary health care organisations and the strategies that can help individuals and organisations create trust and collaborate."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Rae Walker","data":{"first_name":"Rae","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0034524","middle_name":"","last_name":"Walker","source_individual_id":"RMIS456116","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Rae Walker"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/85945","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3088","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The quinoline antimalarials: Mechanisms of action and resistance in Plasmodium falciparum","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["antimalarial drugs","drug resistance","parasite protein sequencing","photoaffinity labelling"],"nhmrc_grant_id":191208,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["drug action","drug design","drug resistance","malaria"],"scientific_title":"The quinoline antimalarials: Mechanisms of action and resistance in Plasmodium falciparum","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Medical Parasitology","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","cia_name":"Prof Leann Tilley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/191208","simplified_title":"Understanding antimalarial drug action and parasite resistance","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"316650","source_system":"Malaria is a debilitating parasitic disease that is responsible for the deaths of about two million children each year.

We propose to test the hypothesis that chloroquine acts by interfering with the detoxification of the by-products that are produced when the parasite feeds on haemoglobin. We propose that the parasite develops resistance to chloroquine by excluding either the drug or the toxic by-products from the site of action. We further propose that proteins of the digestive vacuole of the parasite are involved in the development of resistance to chloroquine.

Much current research is aimed at exploring the molecular interactions between malarial proteins and host components in order to gain a deeper understanding of parasite virulence mechanisms, design alternative anti-malarial approaches and improve vaccine design. The apical membrane antigen-1( AMA-1) is a surface exposed protein which is thought to play a crucial role in invasion of red blood cells by malaria parasites, and is currently one of the leading asexual stage vaccine candidates. While antibodies to AMA-1 prevents malaria invasion, little is known about the role of the antigen in the invasion process. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the molecular interactions that makes AMA-1 an important player in the invasion process. We propose to map the regions of AMA-1 responsible for binding a set of peptides which we have isolated from random peptide libraries. Since these peptides inhibit the invasion of parasites into red blood cells, regions of AMA1- that bind these peptides will be of functional significance. A further outcome will be the identification of peptide residues essential for the inhibition of invasion followed by in vitro evolution of these peptides to improve their binding and inhibitory properties. A molecular description of how AMA1 binding peptides prevent parasite invasion of host erythrocytes will improve our understanding of the invasion process, and aid in improving vaccines based on AMA-1. Furthermore, this peptide-AMA-1 interaction will be assessed as a possible target for the development of novel anti-malarial therapies. Using random peptide libraries we have selected peptides that specifically bind to other merozoite surface proteins thought to be involved in merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. The ability of these peptides to inhibit merozoite invasion will be examined and characterised as described above."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Michael Foley","data":{"first_name":"Michael","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0007304","middle_name":"","last_name":"Foley","source_individual_id":"RMIS522146","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Michael Foley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/78669","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3090","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Efficacy of asexual blood-stage antigens and antigen combinations for vaccination of mice against Plasmodium chabaudi.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["Asexual blood-stage antigens","Plasmodium chabaudi","Recombinant proteins","Vaccine efficacy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":191210,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["Malaria","Parasitaemia","Vaccination"],"scientific_title":"Efficacy of asexual blood-stage antigens and antigen combinations for vaccination of mice against Plasmodium chabaudi.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Immunology not elsewhere classified","research_area":"Basic Science","for_category":"IMMUNOLOGY","cia_name":"E/Pr Robin Anders","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/191210","simplified_title":"Malaria vaccines in the Plasmodium chabaudi/mouse model","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"286320","source_system":"The development of a vaccine against malaria is one of the world's major public health priorities. Over the last two decades much progress has been made towards the development of a malaria vaccine but none is yet available that is suitable for use in humans. Many parasite molecules have been identified that are considered potential components of a malaria vaccine and some of these have already reach the stage of being tested in early clinical trials. However, a major problem confronting the field of malaria vaccine development is finding the resources necessary to test the large number of antigens and antigen combinations that are considered of potential value. One way to gain information that will help to determine which antigens and antigen combinations should have priority for testing in clinical trials is to carry out vaccine trials in monkeys or mice using malaria parasites that infect these species. We will use Plasmodium chabaudi infections in the mouse to examine the ability of three antigens from the disease causing blood stages of the parasite to induce antibody responses that prevent the development of severe malaria. We will determine whether antigen combinations provide better protection than single antigens when mice are challenged with a variety of parasite strains. Detailed analyses of the antibody responses will be carried out to determine if combining antigens changes the response in a way that may help or hinder vaccine efficacy."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Robin Anders","data":{"first_name":"Robin","title":"","dw_individual_id":"DW0029158","middle_name":"Fredric","last_name":"Anders","source_individual_id":"RMIS216800","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Robin Anders"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84560","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3091","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Effectiveness of training somatosensation in the hand after stroke: A randomized controlled trial.","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2004,"keywords":["occupational therapy","physiotherapy","rehabilitation","stroke","therapy"],"nhmrc_grant_id":191214,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["physiotherapy","rehabilitation","stroke","stroke rehabilitation"],"scientific_title":"Effectiveness of training somatosensation in the hand after stroke: A randomized controlled trial.","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Rehabilitation and Therapy: Occupational and Physical","research_area":"Health Services Research","for_category":"CLINICAL SCIENCES","cia_name":"Prof Leeanne Carey","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/191214","simplified_title":"Sensory retraining after stroke: a controlled clinical trial","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"180660","source_system":"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, requiring provision of rehabilitation services to help minimize impairment and its impact on the ability to resume daily activities. The ability to feel textures and objects through touch and to know where one s limbs are in space are impaired in up to 85% of people who have suffered a stroke. People with this loss are handicapped by difficulties in exploring objects through touch and in performing everyday tasks that require grasp and manipulation of objects. Yet clinicians are either not treating the problem or are using methods without a sound theoretical basis and controlled evidence to support their application. We have systematically investigated optimal methods of sensory training across different sensory abilities using a series of single-subject experiments. Marked improvement in the ability to discriminate trained and related untrained texture stimuli and limb positions was achieved and maintained in most participants. These findings have provided the foundation for development a scientifically based and clinically focused sensory retraining program that has apparently excellent therapeutic potential. The purpose of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of this scientifically based, clinical sensory retraining program in a broad group of stroke clients using the internationally recommended randomized controlled group design. The program will train a range of functionally important sensory discrimination tasks, i.e. texture discrimination, limb position sense and tactual object recognition, in clinical and home environments. Demonstration of clinically important and statistically significant training effects will provide the evidence necessary to recommend the introduction of the program into routine health service delivery. Investigation of patient characteristics that may impact on the ability to benefit from training will assist in the targeting of services to appropriate individuals."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Thomas Matyas","data":{"first_name":"Thomas","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0038349","middle_name":"A","last_name":"Matyas","source_individual_id":"RMIS95580","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Thomas Matyas"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86935","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Richard Macdonell","data":{"first_name":"Richard","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0038206","middle_name":"Alan","last_name":"Macdonell","source_individual_id":"5024033","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RGMS","full_name":"Prof Richard Macdonell"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/86902","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Leeanne Carey","data":{"first_name":"Leeanne","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0029787","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Carey","source_individual_id":"RMIS460181","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Leeanne Carey"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/84710","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Derick Wade","data":{"first_name":"Derick","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0022764","middle_name":"T","last_name":"Wade","source_individual_id":"RMIS1162987","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Derick Wade"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/82863","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3092","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Reducing maternal depression two years after birth: follow-up of a cohort within a community randomised trial","data":{"media_summary":"temperament (child)","end_year":2004,"keywords":["community intervention study","maternal mental health","public health","women's health"],"nhmrc_grant_id":191215,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["health status","postnatal depression","quality of life","social determinants of health","temperament (child)"],"scientific_title":"Reducing maternal depression two years after birth: follow-up of a cohort within a community randomised trial","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"Prof Judith Lumley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/191215","simplified_title":"Reducing maternal depression two years after birth","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"359920","source_system":"Maternal depression following childbirth is a significant public health issue. Previous Victorian research has found that 15-17% of women experience depression 6-9 months after birth, and of those depressed then, 30% are likely still to be depressed or depressed again two years after the birth. In 1998 16 Victorian municipalities began participating in the first ever community randomised trial of prevention and early intervention in depression - PRISM (Program of Resources, Information and Support for Mothers). PRISM involves eight areas participating in a range of primary care and community based strategies designed to mobilise appropriate community support for mothers and children with a view to reducing maternal depression and improving maternal physical health and recovery after birth. The other eight areas are participating as comparison communities. Evaluation in PRISM is assessing major health outcomes for mothers and wider community benefits (flow-on effects) of the intervention program. Process and impact evaluation has also been undertaken to document and assess the different program elements and enhance the reproducibility of the program if successful. All women giving birth in the 16 areas are currently being surveyed six months after birth (from August 2000-February 2002). Within PRISM it is now proposed to follow-up women again two years after birth, to assess the impact of the intervention program on: *recovery from depression among the group of mothers in both intervention and comparison areas who were depressed six months after birth; and *the overall prevalence of depression and physical ill-health in all mothers. This follow-up study has the capacity to provide infromation on the poorly documented natural history of maternal depression from birth through the next two years in a large sample, including both urban and rural residents."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms Lyndsey Watson","data":{"first_name":"Lyndsey","title":"Ms","dw_individual_id":"DW0040360","middle_name":"F","last_name":"Watson","source_individual_id":"RMIS141968","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Ms Lyndsey Watson"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/87458","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judith Lumley","data":{"first_name":"Judith","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0008767","middle_name":"M","last_name":"Lumley","source_individual_id":"RMIS141965","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Judith Lumley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/79071","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Rhonda Small","data":{"first_name":"Rhonda","title":"Prof","dw_individual_id":"DW0004696","middle_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"Small","source_individual_id":"RMIS6607","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"Prof Rhonda Small"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/77975","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Pr Stephanie Brown","data":{"first_name":"Stephanie","title":"A/Pr","dw_individual_id":"DW0000588","middle_name":"Janne","last_name":"Brown","source_individual_id":"RMIS6518","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Researcher","source_system":"RMIS","full_name":"A/Pr Stephanie Brown"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/76817","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/3093","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Maternal health after childbirth: a prospective cohort study of 1900 nulliparous women recruited in early pregnancy","data":{"media_summary":"sexual problems after childbirth","end_year":2006,"keywords":["incidence of maternal morbidity","maternal and child health","obstetric risk factors for postnatal maternal morbidity","prospective cohort"],"nhmrc_grant_id":191222,"application_year":2001,"health_keywords":["incontinence of urine, flatus, faeces","inequalities in health services, access and outcomes","maternal health","perineal pain","sexual problems after childbirth"],"scientific_title":"Maternal health after childbirth: a prospective cohort study of 1900 nulliparous women recruited in early pregnancy","start_year":2002,"node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Epidemiology","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr Stephanie Brown","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/191222","simplified_title":"Women's health after childbirth","sub_type":"Epidemiology","total_budget":"697150","source_system":"Recent research highlights a concerning burden of ill health in recent mothers. Common health problems in the year after birth are chronic exhaustion, persisting pain, urinary incontinence, bowel problems, sexual problems and depression. This study will investigate the incidence, onset, severity and duration of health problems in the first 18 months after childbirth. A major focus of the study will be on the extent to which common health problems affecting women after childbirth occur as new problems in pregnancy, or after childbirth. This involves following women having a first child and measuring their health in pregnancy and the first year after birth. 1900 women having a first birth will be recruited to the study in early pregnancy, and followed up until 18 months after the birth. A major aim of the study is to provide stronger evidence about the role of pregnancy and birth factors in physical health problems after birth. In particular, the study will examine the contribution of method of delivery to pelvic floor disorders (urinary and anal incontinence, perineal pain and sexual problems). The study will also examine reasons why many women choose not to discuss physical and emotional health problems with health professionals in the postnatal period. The influence of cultural, social and economic factors on health service use and disclosure of maternal health problems will be explored. The study will provide the first Australian data on new health problems experienced for the first time after childbirth, and the extent to which pregnancy, labour and birth contribute to subsequent ill-health. The findings will provide stronger evidence on which to base the care of women during childbirth,development and evaluation of primary and secondary prevention strategies, and information to women and their families regarding the risks of obstetric procedures, such as caesarean section and vaginal birth assisted with forceps."},"children":[{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof Judith
