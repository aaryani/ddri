Concerns over biosecurity and an increased political awareness of infectious disease have led to a resurgence in worldwide interest in parasitology, one of Australia's research strengths. The key priorities of the ARC Network for Parasitology are to strengthen Australia's capacity to understand and control parasites and to raise awareness of Australia's parasitology research through a communications strategy targeting all levels of the community including health workers, farmers, veterinarians, national parks and fisheries staff, teachers and students.","scientific_title":"ARC/NHMRC Research Network for Parasitology","start_year":2004,"arc_grant_id":"RN0460368","total_budget":"$750,000","arc_scheme":"RN","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of Technology, Sydney","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"University of Technology, Sydney","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-502828","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89470","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/127002","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141239","size":1}
