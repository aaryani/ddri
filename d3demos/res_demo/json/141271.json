Because we still know very little about how genetic variation is distributed among the multiple traits that are likely to respond to selection in such circumstances, we have no way of directly measuring the evolutionary potential of any natural population.  In this proposal, we develop the theory, statistical tools, and experimental designs to investigate the nature and prevalence of these multivariate genetic constraints.","scientific_title":"The Geometry of Genetic Limits to Evolutionary Change","start_year":2010,"arc_grant_id":"DP1093474","total_budget":"$630,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of Queensland","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Queensland","state":"Qld","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89183","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/111523","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141271","size":1}
