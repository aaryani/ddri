About 4% of young adults have it. There is increasing concern by experts about the efficacy of the recommended chlamydia treatment. This is further supported by very high repeat infection rates following a previous positive chlamydia diagnosis. This study will measure whether chlamydia treatment failure is a problem and if so, this will change treatment guidelines worldwide."},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of Melbourne","data":{"source":"NHMRC","name":"University of Melbourne","state":"VIC","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-513462","type":"University","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/16","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/72572","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae antmicrobial resistance: detection and propagation","data":{"media_summary":"","end_year":2014,"keywords":["antibiotic resistance","gonorrhoea","molecular epidemiology","Aboriginal health","remote communities"],"nhmrc_grant_id":1025517,"application_year":2011,"start_year":2012,"scientific_title":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae antmicrobial resistance: detection and propagation","node_source":"NHMRC","node_type":"Grant","field_of_research":"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health","research_area":"Public Health","for_category":"PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES","cia_name":"A/Pr David Whiley","higher_grant_type":"NHMRC Project Grants","purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1025517","simplified_title":"Investigating new problems of antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae","sub_type":"Standard Project Grant","total_budget":"435129.13","source_system":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen that causes gonorrhoea, has developed resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics.
