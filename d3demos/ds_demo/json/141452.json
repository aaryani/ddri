However, few species display appropriate discrete polymorphisms, and as such, there is little empirical evidence to support these ideas. Using a series of innovative experiments and a unique bird displaying three discrete head colours, I will test these theories, producing results which will have a major international impact. Understanding the interaction of environmental and genetic diversity in the highly endangered Gouldian finch also offers an opportunity to provide insight into how declining wild populations can be effectively managed.","scientific_title":"Alternative life-history strategies in the evolution of colour polymorphism","start_year":2007,"arc_grant_id":"DP0770889","total_budget":"$422,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of New South Wales","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of New South Wales","state":"NSW","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89069","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/101943","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141448","size":1}],"class":"Dataset","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141452","size":1}
