A description of the processes that lead to mt genome reorganization will have a substantial impact on our understanding in two areas of mt biology; (1) the discovery of new molecular phenomena that impact on the organization and evolution of this genome, and (2) the interpretation of its phylogenetic content.  It will establish our research group as a leader in the field of evolutionary genetics.  Training of high quality students, with exposure to international researchers, will be a significant component of this program.","scientific_title":"Structural reorganization of the hymenopteran mitochondrial genome","start_year":2005,"arc_grant_id":"DP0556545","total_budget":"$180,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of Wollongong","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"University of Wollongong","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-464691","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89271","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/97877","size":1},{"color":"#FF4D4D","name":"The evolution of multipartite mitochondrial genomes in the cyst-forming nematodes","data":{"research_area":"ZOOLOGY","research_area_code":"2705","application_year":2004,"purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP0556520","description":"The cyst-forming nematodes are a serious pest of agricultural crops throughout the world, attacking cereal, root and legume crops.  Although sporadically recorded in Australia, they have not become established here.  This project will characterize unique sequences from the noncoding portion of the mitochondrial genome of a range of cyst-forming nematodes, facilitating the development of molecular diagnostic screening tools for these crop pests.  This program will train a number of young scientists with skills in biotechnology, preparing them to join programs safeguarding our agricultural industries.","scientific_title":"The evolution of multipartite mitochondrial genomes in the cyst-forming nematodes","start_year":2005,"arc_grant_id":"DP0556520","total_budget":"$180,000","arc_scheme":"DP","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of Wollongong","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"University of Wollongong","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-464691","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89271","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/97863","size":1}],"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141192","size":1}],"class":"Dataset","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/141194","size":1}
