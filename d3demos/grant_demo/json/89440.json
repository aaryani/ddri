The project will provide a biological basis for the development of management strategies to provide positive outcomes for the Kangaroo Island environment and potential economic benefit to the local and national economy. Environmental benefit includes the reduction of total grazing pressure on pastures and native vegetation of Kangaroo Island, which is one of Australia’s top 15 biodiversity ‘hot spots’, and thus help with conservation efforts on Kangaroo Island. Economic benefit will follow if farmers receive income from a currently wasted resource.","scientific_title":"The extent of competition between the native and introduced herbivores of Kangaroo Island.","start_year":2007,"arc_grant_id":"DI0775793","total_budget":"$85,800","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of Adelaide","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Adelaide","state":"SA","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-460832","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89063","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr RJ Bosworth; Dr PG Stott; A/Prof GS Howarth","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0775793:Mr RJ Bosworth; Dr PG Stott; A/Prof GS Howarth","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Mr RJ Bosworth; Dr PG Stott; A/Prof GS Howarth"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89441","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89440","size":1}
