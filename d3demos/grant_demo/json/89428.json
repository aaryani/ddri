Indigenous Knowledge Research is a new methodological development that will afford research in many cross-cultural contexts including those where literacy and numeracy skills are low. This research methodology has national and community significance because it fosters social cohesion in investigating problematic contexts through methods that bridge across groups and build community capacities to engage, identify and implement self-owned solutions. This research will facilitate the instigation of informational gathering structures in the most marginalized sectors of the Australian community.","scientific_title":"Testing Ground: Investigating Indigenous Knowledge Programs and Indigenous Research Methodologies in Higher Education.","start_year":2006,"arc_grant_id":"DI0668285","total_budget":"$48,570","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of Queensland","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Queensland","state":"Qld","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89183","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr N Sheehan; Em/Prof JS Western","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0668285:Dr N Sheehan; Em/Prof JS Western","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Dr N Sheehan; Em/Prof JS Western"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89429","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89428","size":1}
