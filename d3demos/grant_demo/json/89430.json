There is evidence that Indigenous students could excel in mathematics if it is contextualised and taught from patterns and structure. A theory showing how Indigenous students can develop strong mathematical understandings would provide a counter to accepted wisdom of low performance and a model for future Indigenous student attainment. Making mathematics-based University disciplines a reality for Indigenous students will benefit individual students, their community and the economic future of Australia.","scientific_title":"Indigenous world view, algebra pedagogy and improving Indigenous performance in secondary mathematics","start_year":2006,"arc_grant_id":"DI0668328","total_budget":"$159,713","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Griffith University","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"Griffith University","state":"Qld","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-465942","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89385","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr CJ Matthews; Prof TJ Cooper","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0668328:Dr CJ Matthews; Prof TJ Cooper","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Dr CJ Matthews; Prof TJ Cooper"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89431","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89430","size":1}
