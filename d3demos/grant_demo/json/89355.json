This project aims to investigate how Aboriginal art styles have been influenced by European settlement and ideas during the last century in this region.  The chief investigator will survey the historical record, examine collections of material cultural objects and the artworks held in Australian museums, and conduct fieldwork in the region. The project will result in the first comprehensive account of the art traditions in Aboriginal Communities of the area with anticipated outcomes of field reports, journal publications and a PhD thesis.","scientific_title":"Aboriginal art history and tradition in the West Kimberley region, Western Australia: Representations and constructions of place, space and identity.","start_year":2002,"arc_grant_id":"DI0239285","total_budget":"$15,000","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of Melbourne","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Melbourne","state":"Vic","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89196","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof M Langton","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0239285:Prof M Langton","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Prof M Langton"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89357","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms CA Coyne","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0239285:Ms CA Coyne","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Ms CA Coyne"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89356","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89355","size":1}
