To allow for marketable levels of production of the bioactive compound, numerous amounts of plants would need to be removed from the environment. This not only removes the limited supply of possibly rare types of plants from the environment but also denies the use of this plant by traditional people. Locating and using the genes responsible for producing these bioactive compounds will allow their sustainable biosynthesis.","scientific_title":"The genetic basis for bioactivity in the traditional medicine plants of Australia","start_year":2006,"arc_grant_id":"DI0668388","total_budget":"$87,458","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of New South Wales","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of New South Wales","state":"NSW","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89069","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr SD Ingrey; A/Prof BA Neilan","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0668388:Mr SD Ingrey; A/Prof BA Neilan","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Mr SD Ingrey; A/Prof BA Neilan"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89437","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89436","size":1}
