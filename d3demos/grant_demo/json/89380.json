Does the Indigenous entrepreneur become in effect culturally non-indigenous whilst engaged in entrepreneurial activity? or, are the individuals cultural values maintained, transformed, subdued in some other context?  These are the questions that this proposed research hopes to answer.  The study is concerned with the connection between Anglo-European business values and general Indigenous cultural values.  Little research has been published on Indigenous entrepreneurship; this project will fill a void in current literature in this area.","scientific_title":"A Case Study Analysis of Indigenous Australian Entrepreneurs Exploring the Retention of Indigenous Values","start_year":2002,"arc_grant_id":"DI0240879","total_budget":"$24,050","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of Tasmania","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"University of Tasmania","state":"Tas","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-460913","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89378","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr D Foley","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0240879:Mr D Foley","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Mr D Foley"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89381","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89380","size":1}
