Identifying specific psychological constructs that act as potent keys directly impacting on Indigenous students educational aspirations will eventually assist Indigenous students in reaching their full potential. In identifying these causal constructs, potent new interventions can then be created to enhance Indigenous schooling, create a stronger capital base in Aboriginal communities, and ensure a stronger Indigenous Australian representative population who will aid in shaping a better future for Australia.","scientific_title":"New Solutions For Maximising Secondary Indigenous Students?
