Low Indigenous mathematics performance is a national shame - many school leavers have limited employment and life chances. A theory that explains 2-4 years old Indigenous students' cognitive, affective and sociocultural development of the necessary number language and processes to ensure school entry with similar number knowledge and practices to same age non-Indigenous students has the potential to reduce unemployment and the reliance on welfare that has led to many of the social and health problems of Indigenous communities.","scientific_title":"How young (2-4 years) Indigenous learners come to know and not know early mathematical language and processes","start_year":2007,"arc_grant_id":"DI0775799","total_budget":"$99,000","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"Queensland University of Technology","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"Queensland University of Technology","state":"Qld","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-536697","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89444","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mrs GE Sarra; Dr AR Baturo","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0775799:Mrs GE Sarra; Dr AR Baturo","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Mrs GE Sarra; Dr AR Baturo"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89447","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89446","size":1}
