There has been much written and researched regarding the relationships between white men and Aboriginal women, including studies of the role and abuse of Aboriginal women in the stock industry and the maltreatment endured by Aboriginal girls taken from their families and indentured out into the apprenticeship scheme. However, this study aims to research the reverse subject; that is relationships between Aboriginal men and white women. The outcome is intended not only to be a contribution to historical scholarship, but also to the contemporary debates on issues surrounding reconciliation, gender, inter-marriage and colonialism.
