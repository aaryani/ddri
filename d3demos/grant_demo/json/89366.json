This would be the first academic research undertaking of its kind in this area; establish a series of case studies and best practice scenarios that highlight regional opportunities; and identify relevant ?partnerships? that support Nyungar tourist development both from mainstream and Aboriginal partners; establish a web site to act as a WA resource for Indigenous tourism operations.
