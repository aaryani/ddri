It examines the ways in which Indigenous customary practices continue among the Malgana people, and how connection to sea and country remains an important facet of life. Drawing upon archaeological, historical and ethnographic materials, this project will produce an original account of changing patterns of identification with Aboriginal cultural heritage in an Indigenous community. The study will encompass relations between Malgana people and others who have historically come to live in the area.","scientific_title":"Cultural continuity and change at Shark Bay, Western Australia: an anthopological and historical study of the Malagana Aboriginal people.","start_year":2003,"arc_grant_id":"DI0347845","total_budget":"$10,000","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of Western Australia","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Western Australia","state":"WA","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89390","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof S Bowdler","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0347845:Prof S Bowdler","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Prof S Bowdler"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89394","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof DS Trigger","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0347845:Prof DS Trigger","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Prof DS Trigger"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89393","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms DJ Oxenham","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0347845:Ms DJ Oxenham","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Ms DJ Oxenham"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89392","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89391","size":1}
