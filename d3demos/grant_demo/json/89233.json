The Centre will undertake fundamental research organised around four themes; perception, control, learning and systems. These themes will interact through two research demonstrators focused around a built environment and a natural outdoor environment. The Centre brings together a critical mass of over 70 staff and research students from three leading research groups. The partners also have substantial track record in the commercial exploitation of autonomous systems. The proposed Centre offers the potential of growing into the world's leading autonomous systems research centre.","scientific_title":"Centre for Autonomous Systems","start_year":2003,"arc_grant_id":"CE0348228","total_budget":"$15,200,000","arc_scheme":"CE","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of Sydney","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of Sydney","state":"NSW","nla":"http://sydney.edu.au/","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89230","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Prof EM Nebot","data":{"arc_personal_id":"CE0348228:A/Prof EM Nebot","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"A/Prof EM Nebot"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89237","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof G Dissanayake","data":{"arc_personal_id":"CE0348228:Prof G Dissanayake","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Prof G Dissanayake"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89236","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof CA Sammut","data":{"arc_personal_id":"CE0348228:Prof CA Sammut","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Prof CA Sammut"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89235","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Prof HF Durrant-Whyte","data":{"arc_personal_id":"CE0348228:Prof HF Durrant-Whyte","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Prof HF Durrant-Whyte"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89234","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89233","size":1}
