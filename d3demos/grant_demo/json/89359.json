Indigenous Australian peoples and communities share a number of common historical and socio-economic experiences, and also differ one from another in terms of culture, language and tradition. However, the core concepts of mental health may have sufficiently similar characteristic and process across the communities. This ethnographic case study approach will provide i) a process for culturally mapping how Nyikina-Mangala people conceptualise 'mental health' and ii) develop culturally appropriate mental health promotion and prevention programs for indigenous communities.","scientific_title":"Living in Harmony: A case study on Aboriginal Mental Health Promotion to develop an understanding of the capacity of Indigenous Australians","start_year":2002,"arc_grant_id":"DI0240329","total_budget":"$62,310","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The University of New England","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The University of New England","state":"NSW","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89358","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr A Singh","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0240329:Dr A Singh","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Dr A Singh"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89363","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Dr AJ Madison","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0240329:Dr AJ Madison","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Dr AJ Madison"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89362","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"A/Prof D Plummer","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0240329:A/Prof D Plummer","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"A/Prof D Plummer"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89361","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms A Poelina","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0240329:Ms A Poelina","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Ms A Poelina"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89360","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89359","size":1}
