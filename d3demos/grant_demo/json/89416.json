The structure of the project calls for a comprehensive literature review and data collection via interviews around Anangu Song-Cycle.  While others researchers have touched upon Song-Cycles, in depth-analysis of the specific context of Anangu Song-Cycles are largely unexamined. To date there have been no analysis conducted by Anangu academics themselves. The implementation of the research findings will have implications for Anangu communities in the changing way schools construct curricula and knowledge transmission for Anangu.","scientific_title":"TOWARD ANANGU PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES TO TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE AND PARALLEL EDUCATIONAL PARADIGMS: Song-cycle from senior women of the Antikirinya/Yankuntjatjara community.","start_year":2005,"arc_grant_id":"DI0560542","total_budget":"$60,720","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"The Flinders University of South Australia","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"The Flinders University of South Australia","state":"SA","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-593299","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89404","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Ms S Tur; Dr C Nicholls; A/Prof TA Bunda","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0560542:Ms S Tur; Dr C Nicholls; A/Prof TA Bunda","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Ms S Tur; Dr C Nicholls; A/Prof TA Bunda"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89417","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89416","size":1}
