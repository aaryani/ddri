There are not many Elders left in my family and I believe that it is important for their stories to be told to the wider community and also as a record for the younger generation of my family to have as a tribute to our people. The significantly different life that Indigenous people have lived will contribute to an interesting and engaging public history.","scientific_title":"A Documentation and Multi-Method Critical Analysis of Ngarabal and Biripi Elders' Perspectives and Experiences of Australian History.","start_year":2007,"arc_grant_id":"DI0775798","total_budget":"$55,000","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of Western Sydney","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"University of Western Sydney","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-485355","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89395","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Miss F Blacklock; Prof RG Craven; Dr GE Munns","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0775798:Miss F Blacklock; Prof RG Craven; Dr GE Munns","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Miss F Blacklock; Prof RG Craven; Dr GE Munns"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89443","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89442","size":1}
