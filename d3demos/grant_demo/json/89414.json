Given the vital importance of aspirations for predicating life opportunities this is of dire concern. Utilising a synergistic blend of quantitative and qualitative research methodology this investigation aims to identify factors that positively and negatively impact on Indigenous students setting and achieving their aspirations, and test whether the pattern of relations between identified factors and aspirations differentially varies for Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. The project will also demonstrate the reliability of important measurement instruments for Indigenous populations and distinguish effective theoretical orientations and research methodology.","scientific_title":"Unlocking Indigenous Students' full potential: A critical analysis of Indigenous students' aspirations","start_year":2004,"arc_grant_id":"DI0454365","total_budget":"$46,444","arc_scheme":"DI","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Grant"},"children":[{"color":"#0066FF","name":"University of Western Sydney","data":{"source":"ARC","name":"University of Western Sydney","state":"NSW","nla":"http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-485355","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Institution"},"class":"Institution","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89395","size":1},{"color":"#336699","name":"Mr A Parente; A/Prof RG Craven","data":{"arc_personal_id":"DI0454365:Mr A Parente; A/Prof RG Craven","node_source":"ARC","node_type":"Researcher","full_name":"Mr A Parente; A/Prof RG Craven"},"class":"Researcher","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89415","size":1}],"class":"Grant","self":"http://localhost:7474/db/data/node/89414","size":1}
