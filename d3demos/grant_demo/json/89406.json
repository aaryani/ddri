It does so by asking  ?what is Indigenous about Indigenous research? and ?can there be a distinctive Indigenous Australian perspective on epistemology, methodology and philosophy of research??   The research will be informed by analysis of key text/ discourses on Indigenous research methodologies by Indigenous scholars engaged in transformative praxis.  Outcomes include the completion of a PhD candidature, mapping concepts and theories of Indigenous Research Methodologies, developing an Indigenous intellectual framework to assist Indigenous scholars to negotiate knowledge production and research methodologies.
