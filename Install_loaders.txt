To complie and install loaders you will need Eclipse and Marven.

After installing maven, you can compile and install this library locally with command

mvn install

You will also need to install our Rest and ResearchData libraryes. Rest library should be installed firsr:

cd src/REST/rest
mvn install
cd ../../..
cd src/ResearchData/researchdata
mvn install

The ARC and NHMRC loaders can be installed via eclipse, or you can use command

to build them 

The compliled stand alone version of loaders are in bin directory.

Both loaders requare ARC and NHMRC data to be in the same folder.
